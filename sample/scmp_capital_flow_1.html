<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, the world's largest holder of foreign reserves, saw its pool of foreign assets decline for the first time in more than a decade, triggering worries about an unbridled capital outflow that could adversely affect the mainland economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's foreign reserves stood at US$3.181 trillion at the end of December, down from US$3.2 trillion on September 30, according to the People's Bank of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A quarterly drop in China's foreign reserves has not been seen since 1998, when rampant capital outflow occurred in the Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves reached a record US$3.27 trillion in October and then dwindled by US$52.89 billion in November and by US$39.76 billion in December, the first time the figure fell for two consecutive months since the first quarter of 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lack of transparency in China has made it difficult to clearly explain the reasons for the drop, but economists said the increase in rich mainlanders transferring their assets abroad definitely played an important role in the reduction of foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's economy, capitalising on a huge trade surplus and ever-increasing foreign direct investments, has been on a growth fast track over the past two decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thousands of entrepreneurs amassed fortunes as their businesses secured massive overseas orders for everything from shoes and cigarette lighters to leather bags.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, concerns about potential political instability and the sustainability of their businesses prompted many rich people to place part of their money in foreign countries where personal wealth is better protected under democratic systems of government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I've seen an increasing number of entrepreneurs planning to transfer their fortunes abroad because they want to seek a safe haven for their money," said Xiao Zhixing, an associate professor of management at the China Europe International Business School. "Well-educated rich people, in particular, are desperate to do so."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China still has tight controls on cross-border capital flow, although in recent years the government encouraged outbound investments by state-owned institutions and companies as a way of easing inflationary pressure on the domestic economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Privately-owned enterprises or their owners cannot transfer assets abroad and outbound direct investments overseas are subject to strict, lengthy reviews by the authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A typical method used by super-rich mainlanders to bypass these rules is to falsify import deals so they exchange yuan into foreign currencies to buy the "inbound shipments".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The problem doesn't seem very serious now since the government's regulations on fund inflow are still working," said Yi Xianrong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "But the quarterly fall could be a sign that the trend has reversed. China's foreign reserves might start dropping as it is no longer able to achieve a huge trade surplus."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland has long been under pressure to revalue its currency as Western countries accuse it of keeping the yuan artificially cheaper to ensure Chinese-made goods cost less in foreign markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan continued to strengthen last year as the central bank pushed its appreciation through daily fixing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's Commerce Minister Chen Deming said earlier this month the full-year trade surplus in 2011 would narrow 14.5 per cent from a year earlier to US$155.14 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some economists said the capital outflow was also a result of predictions that the yuan had peaked following its constant appreciation since June 2010 when Beijing lifted its de facto peg to the US dollar.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has been ranked the most globalised of 60 economies for the second consecutive year in a survey by accounting firm </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong scored the highest on average on five measures of globalisation - openness to trade, capital flow, exchange of technology and ideas, labour movement and culture integration. It was followed by Ireland and Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan ranked 12th while the mainland was 39th in the survey, for which </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1"> interviewed 1,000 senior executives from companies in Asia, Europe and the United States at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has become the largest initial public offering market in the world over the past three years. Beijing granted Hong Kong a role as an offshore yuan settlement centre last year, facilitating cross-border transactions in the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And as international firms eye up the mainland market, the number of regional headquarters in Hong Kong increased to 1,340 by the end of last year from 1,285 in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, recent tensions between Hongkongers and mainland tourists have raised concerns about how easy it will be for the city to promote cultural integration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will be interesting to see how the recent conflicts with people over the border affect the scores in the next survey," said Agnes Chan, regional partner, Hong Kong and Macau, at </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accounting firm urged the government to improve the city's standard of living to lure more foreign professionals if it wants to retain its top position in the rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is much room for improvement in terms of quality of life in Hong Kong," said Chan, citing poor air quality and cramped living space as issues that can deter expatriates from moving here. "It's quite disappointing that the recent budget failed to address the problem of air pollution."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An acute shortage of international- school places was also a problem, she said. "The Hong Kong government should address the problem by allocating more land for international schools as well as encouraging local students to study at local schools."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the third year </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1"> has released its Globalisation Index, in collaboration with the Economist Intelligence Unit. Singapore took the top spot in the 2009 survey.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's move to tighten requirements for second mortgages is expected to slow sales of older homes but is unlikely to trigger a significant price correction, according to property agents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Midland Realty expects the number of transactions in the secondary residential market could tumble by 11 per cent to 16,000 in the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest mortgage lending policy would deter buying interest from investors with limited budgets while plans by developers to speed up new property launches would lure buyers away from previously owned flats.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Home prices however will edge up 3 to 5 per cent as the third round of quantitative easing measures in the United States prompts inflation," said Buggle Lau Ka-fai, chief analyst at Midland Realty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will lure capital flow into the property market as a way to hedge rising inflation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some flats are continuing to sell at record prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yesterday, a 585 square foot flat in Taikoo Shing in Quarry Bay, one of the most popular residential developments, sold for HK$5.78 million, or HK$9,880 per sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another 692 sq ft flat at Nan Fung Sun Chuen, also in Quarry Bay, changed hands for HK$5.6 million, or HK$8,092 per sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Centaline Property Agency, which handled the transactions, said both deals were record prices for units of that size in the two estates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Because of the strong sales response from </span><span class="s3">Henderson Land Development</span><span class="s1">'s Double Cove in Ma On Shan over the weekend,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Centaline said about 10 per cent of owners in the district either raised their asking prices for properties on sale or held back from selling in hopes of a further increase in home prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the luxury home market, two flats with a total floor area of 5,219 sq ft at Regence Royale in Mid-Levels were sold for HK$139 million or HK$26,595 per sq ft, according to the Land Registry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The buyer is Judy Lau, the sister of Jim Lau Jin-wei, the former chairman of Global Green Tech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some vendors have lowered their prices or sold their flats at a loss after the government foreshadowed additional measures will be introduced if prices continue to rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Property Services Agency said a 1,636 sq ft flat at Celestial Heights in Ho Man Tin sold for HK$21 million, against the HK$25.84 million the owner paid in May 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The flat has been on the market quite some time and only secured a buyer after the launch of QE3," said Steven Yung, sales manager at Hong Kong Property Services Agency's Kowloon luxury home unit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, a 939 sq ft flat at Laguna City in Lam Tin sold for HK$6.75 million, which was below the HK$6.8 million asking price.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first test runs on a high-speed railway that will reduce train trips between Shenzhen and Beijing from 24 hours to nine could begin next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trials began on the final section between the capital and Shijiazhuang , Hebei province, in mid- September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This meant tests for the entire 2,410 kilometre line could begin by December 20, the 21st Century Business Herald reported yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once open, the 294 billion yuan (HK$363 billion) railway will connect 28 cities in five provinces - including Henan , Hubei , Hunan , Hebei and Guangdong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will eventually terminate in Hong Kong, after the Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway opens in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-Shenzhen portion of the railway comprises four sections: Beijing to Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang to Wuhan , Wuhan to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Half of the Shijiazhuang- Wuhan section is also expected to be operational before the full line is tested, following the opening of a segment linking Zhengzhou and Wuhan in late September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Planning experts said the new railway would boost economic development by linking the Bohai Rim economic development area in the northeast, the central plains' economic zones, the Wuhan metropolis cluster and the Pearl River Delta, the 21st Century Business Herald said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would also integrate manpower, capital flow and logistics over a much wider area.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chutian Golden Daily said a second-class ticket from Guangzhou to Beijing was expected to cost between 900 yuan and 1,000 yuan, as the 1,069 kilometre trip from Guangzhou to Wuhan costs 465 yuan, or 0.435 yuan per kilometre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Flights from Guangzhou to Beijing take about 2-1/2 hours by air, with a ticket ranging in price from 1,200 yuan to 1,700 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's airlines are expected to face increasing competition as the high-speed-rail system grows.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CBRE, the world's biggest property agent, is to expand into capital market advisory services in the Asia-Pacific region as mainland outbound investment becomes a major component of global capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That's one of the main reasons we are getting into the new business line," said Rob Blain, chief executive and chairman of CBRE Asia Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Blain said potential clients were eyeing investments not only in the US but other global markets as well, and their targets were not confined to commercial properties. They were also looking at residential units, manufacturing companies and other kinds of businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new unit - CBRE Capital Advisors, Asia Pacific, which will be formed soon - will be responsible for helping clients source capital in the form of equity or debt, executing investment strategies and advising clients on private placements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Singapore-based unit will be headed by Nick Crockett, former head of </span><span class="s3">Jones Lang LaSalle</span><span class="s1">'s Asia-Pacific corporate finance group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland companies are increasingly investing abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a report by economic consultancy Rhodium Group and investment bank CICC, mainland outward foreign direct investment is projected to reach US$1 trillion to US$2 trillion between 2010 and 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Rhodium report shows that in the first three quarters of this year, mainland firms invested a record US$6.3 billion in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While energy and advanced manufacturing continue to land the most investment dollars, 2012 deal flow suggests that Chinese investors are increasingly interested in US service firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from China, capital flow in the Asia-Pacific region in general continues to be strong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The region's contribution to global investment turnover has doubled from 8.3 per cent in 2007 to 16.6 per cent in the 12 months to September, according to CBRE.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">High internet penetration helped Hong Kong remain as the most globalised economy for the third consecutive year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Widespread accessibility to broadband connections and a high usage of personal computers had made international trade more viable in the city, said Agnes Chan, regional managing partner Hong Kong and Macau at consultancy </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its globalisation index, E&amp;Y polled 730 senior business executives worldwide last year to gauge the degree of globalisation relative to the gross domestic product of the economy. Hong Kong led with a score of 7.81 points, followed by Singapore (6.31) and Ireland (5.63).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong led in three of the five categories: exchange of technology and ideas, capital flow, and cultural exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey found that computer penetration was 100 per cent in Hong Kong's big companies and 90 per cent among medium-sized enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The clear lead that Hong Kong posted in the three categories could secure its top place till 2015," Chan said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A public housing tenant who laundered more than HK$6.7 billion through nine Hong Kong banks over almost four years was jailed for 10 years yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, March 13</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take note of what this ridiculous law actually says. It is a crime to handle money in a way that looks to others as if you are laundering it, whether or not you are actually doing so and whoever these others may be.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law says you can be sent to jail for 14 years if you deal with money "known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence". It doesn't require that an indictable offence be proved. It doesn't even require that one be indicated. None was in this latest miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law only requires that reasonable grounds exist to believe that there had been one, whatever it might be and whether anyone in authority even knows what it was. Our courts have accepted that this criterion is met if money is handled in a way that looks surreptitious.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now I know you may consider this a pretty good reason to think crime involved. Why handle money surreptitiously if you don't need to do so? Why spend your whole working day opening bank accounts and transferring small amounts of money in and out of them unless you have something to hide?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I can think of a very good reason. Across the border we have 1.3 billion people who would like to move their money in and out occasionally for entirely reasonable investments and purchases. Their government allows only a privileged few to do it legally and the rest must sneak their way through.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Breaking up their money flows into thousands of little trickles and combining them again on the other side is how they do it. What indictable offence have they committed?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You may say they have broken Beijing's capital flow restrictions and this is deemed a crime across the border.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Perhaps, but it is not a crime here in Hong Kong. It is our lifeblood. Our HK$3.4 trillion a year re-export trade is really an evasion of Beijing's capital flow restrictions, as are the vast foreign direct investment flows that pass through our financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We congratulate the tycoons who handle these for contributing to the prosperity of Hong Kong, and yet we throw a 61-year-old public housing tenant into jail for 10 years for doing the same thing. What hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Don't tell me that this woman could actually have been handling terrorist finances or the proceeds of drug trafficking.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The terrorist idea is ludicrous. Leave alone that the ethnicity makes it highly unlikely, terrorism does not require much money, and what it does require is mostly funnelled through tribal connections that no government agency will ever see.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As to laundering drug money, I don't know how it is done, but I cannot imagine that this crude way of saying "Here I am, here I am, look at me!" is the preferred technique of the drug lords. I'm sure they have much more sophisticated ways of cleaning up their money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also doesn't look right for tax evasion, which is by far the largest reason across the world for money laundering. Tax evasion is done with sleazy lawyers and accountants, not strangers opening small deposit accounts on your behalf in your own jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I say that this woman was doing no more than facilitating mainland capital flows. Prove me wrong, you craven prosecutors who would cite no underlying crime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And if you cannot do so, then confess an unsafe conviction to our chief justice and tell our legislators to repeal this gross invasion of judicial rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is actually no small matter. Our money-laundering ordinance as it stands poses a serious threat to the rule of law. It undermines your right to be presumed innocent of crime unless proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt and your right to know with what crime you are charged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I recognise that it is more difficult to prosecute criminals the right way, but since when has the law become a tool for boosting conviction rates? We are going down the road of the Spanish Inquisition here, and we endanger respect for the law, which is a way to encourage crime.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai has started the countdown to the introduction of a "qualified domestic limited partner" (QDLP) scheme, which will allow foreign hedge funds to raise yuan capital on the mainland to make investments in overseas securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has submitted an application to the country's foreign exchange regulator for a US$5 billion quota, which may then be distributed to funds wishing to participate in the scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai's move comes as it faces competition from Qianhai, an experimental financial zone in Shenzhen that is being used as a testing ground for freer yuan usage and capital account convertibility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government officials said the application for the investment quota was in the final stage of preparatory work for the launch of the scheme, although a launch date had yet to be decided.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An official with the Pudong Financial Services Bureau said: "The QDLP programme will be launched sooner rather than later. The city officials are very active in pushing ahead with major liberalisation, including the QDLP."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the QDLP scheme, qualifying foreign hedge funds must be registered with the local authorities before they can convert yuan funds that they will be allowed to raise from mainland high-net-worth individuals into foreign currencies for securities investments abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scheme, initially proposed by the Shanghai government, is intended to bolster the growth of the domestic hedge fund sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hedge funds that raise capital privately are still in a rudimentary stage on the mainland, and cash-rich Chinese investors have little knowledge about the operations of thesector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai hopes to change all that by introducing powerful global institutions such as Winton Capital and Oaktree Capital, to set an example for the mainland hedge fund industry, although it will allow foreign companies only to play in overseas stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has made no secret of its ambition to transform itself into a global financial centre, but it is facing competition from Qianhai, an otherwise backwater area in Shenzhen which has risen to prominence since Beijing gave it approval last year for a trial of bold financial reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers and fund managers said Qianhai was more efficient than Shanghai in approving the establishment of new funds and loosening regulations on cross-border capital flow between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior Shanghai city officials, including the executive vice-mayor, Tu Guangshao, a former vice-chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, are now actively backing more liberalisation of the financial markets to allow freer cross-border capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is still not fully convertible under the nation's capital account. Foreign institutions may only buy mainland stocks through the qualified foreign institutional investor programme, while mainland investors may buy into qualified domestic institutional investor products offered by mainland mutual funds and banks to gain indirect access to overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The QDLP scheme, designed for foreign hedge funds, complements the qualified foreign limited partner system Shanghai launched in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The domestic limited partner scheme enables domestic capital outflows into foreign securities, whereas the foreign limited partner scheme enables foreign capital inflows into domestic assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, Shanghai obtained a US$3 billion quota to run a pilot version of the QFLP scheme, allowing select foreign investors to convert capital raised outside the mainland into yuan before investing in yuan-denominated private equity and venture capital funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources said Shanghai might now get a US$3 billion initial quota for the QDLP scheme, rather than the US$5 billion it had bid for in its discussions with the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Howhow Zhang, the chief researcher at Z-Ben Advisors in Shanghai, said: "It doesn't look as if foreign hedge funds would find it easy to raise capital domestically, since mainlanders are still not very interested in their products."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland equity investors initially appeared unimpressed with the appointment of Xiao Gang as the chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When he took office on Monday, the Shanghai market fell 1.68 per cent. But the market rebounded 0.78 per cent and 2.66 per cent in the next two days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the concerns of the investors was that personnel changes would result in an about-face in policymaking by the new securities regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Xiao, who resigned as chairman of Bank of China to take up his new role, has pledged to keep CSRC policies consistent, sending a clear message to investors that Beijing is adamant on deepening market-based reform as part of efforts to overhaul the financial sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the country's 100 million stock investors bade farewell to Guo Shuqing, a reform-minded technocrat who led a series of policy changes during his 18-month tenure at the CSRC, they took it for granted that his expected appointment as Shandong governor was a "demotion" because he upset vested interest groups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo was appointed the province's deputy party chief on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo gave priority to the interests of small investors after taking office in late 2011, called a timeout for high-priced initial public offerings, urged zero tolerance on insider trading, and directed a huge capital flow into A shares while tightening delisting rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors regarded him as a white knight for rescuing the beleaguered market and bailing them out of severe losses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it was rumoured that Guo's efforts dealt a heavy blow to vested interest groups, including listing hopefuls, private equity and venture capital funds, and corrupt officials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo also actively proposed creating a national-level integrated bond market with the two stock exchanges playing a dominant role rather than the interbank trading system under the watch of the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform measures pitted him against other ministry-level authorities and the vested interest groups, which investors believed resulted in his "demotion".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources with knowledge of the personnel arrangements disagreed, describing it as a tactic by the country's new leaders to groom Guo for a future political career.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is just the beginning of another round of horse trading in the financial sector, but the personnel changes would have minimal impact on policy directions, according to the sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Party cadres who garner experience in regional areas usually gain a fast ticket to the top echelons of power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shandong, one of the biggest provinces that is of vital importance to the national economy because of its huge industrial and agricultural output, has generated three standing committee members for the Politburo in the past two decades. The appointment as Shandong governor is by all means an endorsement of Guo's capability and integrity</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The appointment as Shandong governor is by all means an endorsement of Guo's capability and integrity," said a Beijing-based source close to the CSRC. "The leadership certainly wants to further implement the reforms in the capital market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premier Li Keqiang said at the weekend his cabinet was determined to defend the people against vested interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo was a top candidate to head the central bank, a more important role in the nation's financial system, but Beijing's last-minute decision to retain Zhou Xiaochuan as governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> led to the new arrangement for Guo, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Jipeng, an economist with the Capital University of Economics and Business, described Guo as a rising political star who would become a top financial policymaker in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While he was at the CSRC, Guo successfully lobbied the central leadership and co-ordinated with the relevant authorities to introduce incentives to bolster investor confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent hefty increase in the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor quota to 270 billion yuan (HK$337 billion) from 70 billion yuan - a move to widen Hong Kong institutions' A-share purchases - provided a vivid snapshot of good teamwork between the CSRC and the foreign exchange regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market drop on Monday reflected investors' worries about policy changes that could hurt their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors were spooked by concerns on when the IPO market would reopen," said Shenyin Wanguo Securities analyst Qian Qimin. "Most of them were taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the personnel changes."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo told the media earlier that the temporary suspension of new listings in October last year was part of a policy aimed at protecting investors' interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiao, a former deputy central bank governor who was credited with leading </span><span class="s3">Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s expansion in the past 10 years, is also known as an enterprising technocrat with sound knowledge about the finance industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October last year, he boldly questioned the wild growth of wealth management products, a rare self-criticism made by a top boss of a major state-owned bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiao earned respect from investors and bankers for his keen perception when the failure of a wealth management product offered by </span><span class="s3">Huaxia Bank</span><span class="s1"> was exposed to the public in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is widely believed that Xiao's remarks on sticking to CSRC's existing policies, or a legacy left by Guo, represents his resolve in further driving the market on par with international practices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his 10-year tenure at </span><span class="s3">Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, Xiao actively introduced Western management style into the country's largest foreign-exchange lender to control risks while pursuing stable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is also seen as a promising "young cadre" in the financial sector and is expected to assume a higher post in government hierarchy in future.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While giving his birthday wishes to Hang Seng Bank for its 80th anniversary, Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah last night urged the lender to further develop yuan business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city is vying with rivals such as Paris, London, Tokyo, Sydney and Singapore to become the premier international yuan trading centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Monetary Authority last week lowered the capital reserves for bankers doing yuan business to encourage them to offer more yuan loans and products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last night, the financial chief called on Hang Seng to do more. Hang Seng has been striving to expand yuan business in support of Hong Kong's strategic position as a leading offshore yuan centre</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hang Seng has been striving to expand yuan business in support of Hong Kong's strategic position as a leading offshore yuan centre," Tsang said last night at the bank's 80th anniversary reception in Wan Chai attended by 2,000 guests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Hang Seng was the lead arranger of the first yuan-denominated syndicated loan in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is not yet fully convertible but since 2009 Beijing has allowed the currency to be used for some trade and investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The policies of the mainland have promoted onshore and offshore yuan capital flow. The use of the yuan has been further expanded to cross-border trades and investment, leading to greater demand for different yuan services," Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Ample business opportunities have been brought to Hong Kong since the opening up of the mainland market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Bank, which started business on March 3, 1933, in an 800 sq ft office in Sheung Wan with 11 employees, is one of the top 50 listed banks in the world and the 18th largest in Asia by market capitalisation. It has about 10,000 staff serving more than three million customers. It has 220 branches in Hong Kong and 46 on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage, said the bank had a strong position in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, the city is very competitive and profit margin here is thin. The future growth story for Hang Seng Bank will depend on its future expansion in yuan business and the mainland market such as Qianhai," Tse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qianhai, in western Shenzhen, is a testing ground for further convertibility of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng chairman Raymond Chien Kuo-fung said: "Hang Seng is committed to playing a role in the further development of the economies of both Hong Kong and mainland China." He said the bank would "capture the increasing business opportunities arising from closer cross-border economic integration and live up to our name as the ever-growing bank".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a move towards internationalising the yuan, the State Council said yesterday it will unveil an operational plan this year to make the currency fully convertible under capital accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The plan is likely to include a clear-cut time frame.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cabinet also said it would establish a comprehensive system for individuals' outbound investments, indicating that Beijing would make a renewed effort to relaunch the "through train" scheme allowing mainlanders to directly buy Hong Kong stocks - a plan that was scrapped in 2007. While the yuan is already convertible under the current account, covering trade, the capital account, which covers portfolio investment and borrowing, is closely controlled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement, which followed a meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang , indicated the leadership may already have drafted a time frame for a freer capital flow. It had been speculated earlier that full convertibility would come by 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council said the decisions at the meeting were in compliance with directives from the Communist Party's Central Economic Working Conference in December chaired by President Xi Jinping .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The statement shows the leadership has attached great importance to the convertibility issue and the operational plan will give the all-clear for liberalisation," said Li Huiyong, chief economist with Shenyin Wanguo Securities. "Global and domestic economic conditions have pushed the leaders to accelerate the pace for reforms." Global and domestic economic conditions have pushed the leaders to accelerate the pace for reforms</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2007, Beijing first announced its ambition to internationalise the yuan and promote its use worldwide in step with China's rising economic heft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liberalisation of the capital account would allow businesses or individuals from home and abroad to freely convert their currencies to buy assets and equities across the border. However, it is likely that, at least initially, the exchange of foreign currencies would still be subject to restrictions by regulators to prevent an entirely free flow of capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing opened the current account in 1996, allowing companies to exchange foreign currencies for trade deals. The central bank put full convertibility on the agenda in 1996, with 2000 as a target date, but the Asian financial turmoil derailed the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China integrates further into the global economy, with domestic capital seeking fresh markets and foreign funds gravitate to the mainland, an open capital account would facilitate capital flow and investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The meeting discussed a lot of issues, but it's not easy to get all of them done," said Industrial Bank chief economist Lu Zhengwei . "The thing that Premier Li is set to do in the near term is to reduce administrative approvals."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and the mainland saw the world's biggest foreign direct investment inflows last year, taking in a combined US$196 billion and eclipsing the US$168 billion invested in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first time, emerging markets attracted more long-term capital than developed economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decisive shift in capital flow came as FDI to developed economies plummeted to almost a 10-year low amid economic weakness, particularly in crisis-ridden Europe, according to the 2013 World Investment Report by the </span><span class="s3">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">UNCTAD</span><span class="s1">).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fragile macroeconomic conditions and policy uncertainty may continue to constrain global FDI growth this year, with </span><span class="s3">UNCTAD</span><span class="s1"> forecasting only a modest increase - to up to US$1.45 trillion this year, compared with US$1.35 trillion last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors would likely regain confidence in the medium term, with flows expected to reach about US$1.6 trillion next year and US$1.8 trillion in 2015, the agency said. But it warned that significant risks remain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Factors such as structural weaknesses in the global financial system, the possible deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, and significant policy uncertainty in areas crucial for investor confidence might lead to a further decline in FDI flows," </span><span class="s3">UNCTAD</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FDI inflows to developed economies dropped 32 per cent to US$561 billion, while global FDI fell 18 per cent. The </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> accounted for almost two-thirds of the global FDI decline, </span><span class="s3">UNCTAD</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outflows from developed economies, meanwhile, shrank by 23 per cent to US$909 billion, close to the trough reached in the 2009 global financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japan bucked both trends, with inflows turning positive last year after two years of net divestment and the country retaining its position as the world's second-biggest outbound investor. Large declines in outward FDI from Europe and North America aided Japan's improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FDI to developing economies proved to be more resilient, recording their second-highest level. Even though they declined by 4 per cent to US$703 billion last year, these flows accounted for 52 per cent of the global total, </span><span class="s3">UNCTAD</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment outflows from developing countries was US$426 billion last year, a record 31 per cent of the world total.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland moved from sixth place to become the third-largest investor last year, behind the US and Japan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese companies remained on a fast track of internationalisation, investing in a wide range of industries and countries," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the mainland remained a top investment destination, FDI inflows dropped 2 per cent to US$121 billion last year amid rising production costs, the agency said. Hong Kong attracted US$75 billion in investment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australians are wrong to fear Chinese investment, but right to stand by their strong military alliance with the US, Australian foreign minister Bob Carr said in Hong Kong yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Carr said that Canberra's historically important relationship with Washington does not have to come at the expense of its growing economic ties with Beijing. Australian people have always thought in terms of a treaty relationship with a strong maritime power. But that doesn't mean we can't have a very fine relationship with China Bob Carr</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Australian people have always thought in terms of a treaty relationship with a strong maritime power," Carr said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But that doesn't mean we can't have a very fine relationship with China."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carr did not believe Sino-Australian relations would be damaged by China's economic slowdown, even though new Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd recently warned that "the China resources boom is over".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said: "Australia is there as the most reliable supplier of China's food security, energy security and resource security." Carr was in Hong Kong as part of a 10-day trip that will include stops in Fujian province and Chengdu , Sichuan province, where he will officially open a new Australian consulate. He also spoke at an </span><span class="s3">Australian Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> lunch yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Video: Bob Carr, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, talks about Australia-China relations</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia sought and welcomed Chinese investment, said Carr, arguing that Australia has accepted all manner of Chinese investments, including those from state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He did not mention the decision last year to bar the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from bidding on the US$38 billion Australian National Broadband Network because of security concerns. A recent opinion poll by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, revealed that more than half of Australians think the government is allowing too much Chinese investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Carr said such investment improved the living standards of Australians.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And he said he was critical of people who are "nervous about foreign ownership of their resources, but at the same time they enjoy the benefit of that capital flow".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Lowy poll also found Australians place more importance on their country's relationship with the US than with China and are increasingly wary of China's military intentions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, Barack Obama announced an increased deployment of 2,500 US marines in Darwin, in Australia's far north, as part of a broader US "pivot" towards East Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has responded negatively to the increased US military presence in the region, accusing co-operating countries of buying into a "China threat" theory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Carr said: "We think that's just a natural evolution in our security relationship with the United States."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is home to some 80,000 Australians, many of whom are involved in business. Carr praised Hong Kong's open economy, which he said made it very comfortable for Australians.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Doing business here is like working in an extension of Australia," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carr outlined three major threats to future economic and social progress in the Asia-Pacific region: ethnic and religious tensions, especially in Myanmar; a "middle-income trap" as growth slows in developing countries; and sovereignty issues and maritime disputes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">United Overseas Bank (UOB)</span><span class="s1">, one of Singapore's three biggest banks by assets, has launched a new foreign direct investment (FDI) advisory unit in Hong Kong and aims to double its business between the city and Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The unit, UOB's sixth after Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and mainland China, will focus on cross-border investment opportunities and help bring Chinese capital to Southeast Asia, the world's fastest-growing emerging market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"UOB Hong Kong is well placed to capitalise on Hong Kong's role as a springboard for companies expanding into Southeast Asia," said UOB Hong Kong's chief executive and managing director Christine Ip.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia is well known for its natural resources, which have attracted many capital-rich mainland companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many mainland state-owned enterprises have set up offices in Hong Kong to serve as their key flagship offshore investment platform, thanks to the city's free foreign-exchange and capital flow systems. This made Hong Kong the sixth-largest source of FDI into the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1"> from 2009-11 after mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ip said foreign investment in Southeast Asia was concentrated in natural resources five years ago but had since diversified to sectors such as commodities, manufacturing and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UOB plans to double its business between Hong Kong and Southeast Asia in three years. Ip said she was confident of achieving that goal with growing FDI and trade volumes in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trade between Hong Kong and Asean grew 26 per cent to US$93.57 billion from 2007 to 2012, while UOB' business rose 51 per cent between the first half of 2012 and the first half of this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hopes are high that when Premier Li Keqiang launches Shanghai's new free-trade zone this weekend, he will announce a major opening up of the mainland's financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But if Li is indeed planning a big relaxation of Beijing's strict controls on cross-border capital flows, he will be swimming against the tide of international economic thought.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For decades economic orthodoxy dictated that emerging economies should open up their financial systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any backsliding was roundly condemned, as in 1998 when in the depths of the Asian currency crisis Malaysia banned free capital flows to stabilise its currency, the ringgit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recently, however, orthodox opinion has reversed. In the future, capital controls could prove not just useful, but essential, for some markets</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consider the Damascene conversion of Stanley Fischer. Between 1994 and 2001, as first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Fischer was closely associated with the Fund's hardline opposition to capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But as governor of the Bank of Israel between 2005 and this June, he found himself taking a different view of the merits of unrestricted capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the US Federal Reserve eased policy in response to the 2007 credit crunch, capital flooded into international markets, pushing the shekel up by 25 per cent in a matter of months. With such rapid appreciation threatening to push Israel into recession, Fischer cast around for a way to slow the inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deterring flows with taxes or regulations wasn't feasible at short notice. "In practice we relied mostly on intervention," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The experience was educational. "Short-term capital flows are frequently more of a hindrance than a help," he admits. "There is a case for trying to moderate their influence."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fischer isn't the only one to revise his views. In 2010, the </span><span class="s3">Asian Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> said members should consider imposing capital controls to stop inflows of hot money fuelling asset bubbles and inflation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now, with the Federal Reserve moving towards ending its monetary stimulus, current IMF managing director Christine Lagarde acknowledges that capital controls might help smaller countries deal with sudden outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Market intervention may help," she told central bankers last month, adding that in the past "capital flow management measures have been useful".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the future, capital controls could prove not just useful, but essential, for some markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although most Asian economies are in a much stronger position today than ahead of the Asian currency crisis, CLSA strategist Russell Napier notes that some Eastern European markets are looking dangerously exposed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many are running gross external debts well above the danger level of 30 per cent of gross domestic product, while economies including Hungary and Bulgaria have foreign debt ratios comparable with Thailand or Indonesia in 1997.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worse, much of their foreign-owned local currency debt is held by open-ended funds. Losses triggered by rising yields as expectations of tapering take hold could prompt a wave of redemptions, Napier warns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With East European markets largely illiquid, any redemptions could spread contagion to relatively healthy markets in Asia as fund managers sell whatever assets they can to meet investors' cash calls, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faced with a rapidly spreading crisis, governments would be quick to impose controls on capital outflows. "The free movement of capital is too disruptive," he says. "It will have to be stopped."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Napier's crisis call is unusually bearish. But his belief that developing economies will impose capital controls to manage outflows is increasingly mainstream.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, of course, already has such controls. Given the international trend, Li Keqiang may well conclude this is no time to dismantle them.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the rising use of the yuan in trade and investment, debate about the Hong Kong dollar's 30-year-old peg to the US dollar is intensifying.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The debate was further fuelled earlier this month when the </span><span class="s3">Bank for International Settlements</span><span class="s1"> said that dealing in the mainland currency had reached the equivalent of US$118 billion a day, accounting for 2.2 per cent of the global foreign-exchange market and exceeding the Hong Kong dollar's 1.4 per cent share. That came just three years after Beijing relaxed rules and allowed the yuan to trade in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Might Hong Kong choose to peg its dollar to the yuan one day? Economists say that's not impossible, but only when the US dollar loses its status as the unrivalled international reserve currency to the yuan - which would take many, many years to achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong dollar should not be pegged to the renminbi as long as the renminbi is not fully convertible - for example, until China has abolished all capital controls, external and domestic," said Invesco chief economist John Greenwood, known as the "father of the Hong Kong-US dollar peg".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In my view this will take many years to achieve because one of the essential preconditions for external convertibility is full domestic capital market liberalisation, which itself will take many years to achieve. Don't underestimate how long this would take."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the US dollar since October 1983, after a monetary crisis triggered a 15 per cent slump in the local currency in one and a half working days. It has been fixed ever since at a rate of around 7.8 to the US dollar. The peg served the special administrative region well during the Asian financial crisis in the late 90s, the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 and the collapse of investment bank </span><span class="s3">Lehman Brothers</span><span class="s1"> in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, a number of big names have called in recent years for the peg to be reviewed and consideration given to linking the currency to the yuan instead. They have included the former head of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, and, most recently, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">'s Asia-Pacific chief executive Peter Wong Tung-shun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong told a forum in Hong Kong this month that the Hong Kong dollar's international impact would be reduced once the yuan became a global currency and the government should reconsider changing its currency peg system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yam challenged the current system in an essay last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"No doubt the LERS [Linked Exchange Rate System] has, for almost 30 years of its existence, been a pillar of stability for Hong Kong. But, realistically there are costs involved," Yam wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is little or no scope to … control the price or supply of base money to achieve … low inflation, low unemployment and stable and sustainable economic growth."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some have blamed the dollar peg for Hong Kong's surging property prices amid quantitative easing in the United States. But Greenwood said Hong Kong regulators had protected Hong Kong by limiting leverage, such as by tightening loan-to-value ratios for mortgages, so that when interest rates increased, Hongkongers would be less vulnerable than if they had been accumulating excessive debt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, a slew of numbers has kept market watchers excited about the yuan's future. It now accounts for 15 per cent of the mainland's global trade and is in the top 10 of world payment currencies. But in reality, economists said, the yuan is still far from being a global currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's market share in global payments is less than 1 per cent, despite a surge in recent usage, according to Swift data. It is not even a member of the Special Drawing Rights basket of the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The basket now uses four key international currencies: the US dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen to supplement member countries' official reserves and bolster liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, with limited freedom in its interest and exchange rate regimes, the mainland has a highly restricted capital account system, limiting capital flow in and out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If China succeeded in abolishing interest rate and other controls in the domestic money and credit markets, then China could proceed to full external convertibility," Greenwood said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Air pollution and President Xi Jinping's campaign to curb official corruption and extravagance took a bite out of the mainland's hospitality industry last year, according to a government think tank report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The "Green Book of China's Tourism" - issued yesterday by the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"> - said revenue at hotels with a three-star rating or above dropped by nearly 12 per cent in the first half of last year, compared with that period in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Revenue at restaurants with an annual turnover of more than two million yuan (HK$2.5 million) fell by 2 per cent, the first decline in three decades. This was due largely to the anti-graft campaign, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central leadership's efforts to curb extravagance has "affected official banquets, high-end tourism, high-end catering and meetings and exhibitions involving industries such as hotels, restaurants and exhibition venues", the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The study did not include statistics for the second half of last year, but figures from the National Tourism Administration showed that hotels with three stars or more saw year-on-year drops in revenue of about 4 per cent in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tourism report also said the numbers of foreign visitors to the country fell 2 per cent in 2012, dropping to 132 million. That trend was expected to have continued last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreigners' reluctance to come to China was attributed by researchers to poor travel services and damage to tourist cities' reputations because of air pollution, food safety scandals and traffic congestion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Watch: A view of Beijing's smog from atop the Forbidden City</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The inbound tourism market became stagnant and later started declining in recent years," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the past year witnessed unprecedented investment in tourism-related projects, said Jin Zhun , a researcher at the academy's tourism research centre who co-authored the new report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Statistics from the tourism administration indicated that the sector saw record-high direct investment of more that 514 billion yuan on the mainland last year - up 27 per cent on the previous year. Private capital was the driving force behind the increase, accounting for 57 per cent of investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Such active capital flow means people have high expectations for tourism and they want to prepare well before another growth peak comes," Jin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu Jinmei , another author of the report, said despite the short-term decline in hotel-and-catering industries' revenues, the anti-corruption drive was unlikely to have a long-term impact on the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We could consider the negative impact on these sectors as removing foam from a hotpot," Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">World Tourism Organisation</span><span class="s1"> said in April that China was the biggest spender on international travel, with Chinese making 83 million trips overseas the previous year. Chinese tourists spent US$102 billion on overseas travel in 2012.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What does the so-called through train scheme mean to Hong Kong? You have probably read a lot about the goodies that are going to come as investors in Hong Kong and Shanghai are allowed to trade in each other's market. Yet everything comes with a price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After contributing money and know-how to the country's economic reform over the past decades, we will now be chipping in our reputation - their most needed and our most precious asset - via the through train scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dollar signs aside, the scheme represents an aggressive "mutual recognition" between two regulatory regimes that are millions of miles apart in every aspect. To cut a long list short: ours is rule-based; theirs is "man-based". Our government stays away from the market; theirs talks the market up and down. Our legal system is trusted; theirs is not. Everything comes with a price … this scheme is a beauty and the beast marriage</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scheme is a marriage of the beauty and the beast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mind you, even marriage between beauties is rare. There are mutual recognition schemes within the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">; between Australia and New Zealand; and between the US and Australia. The latter was shelved after the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allowing companies that are not subject to local regulations to trade at home is an ultra-sensitive issue for every regulator. Yet, in six months, hundreds of mainland companies - beyond the reach of our regulators - will be trading in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing needs this marriage to happen. It is not so much because of the 300 billion yuan inflow that will breathe life into Shanghai's stale A-share market; or the 250 billion yuan outflow to Hong Kong to alleviate an investment spree that has been pushing up asset prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is much more about finding a long-term cure for its dysfunctional stock market, one of the key stumbling blocks to its economic reform. For years, Beijing has been talking about the importance of cultivating a better mix of investors - instead of just short-term punters - to change the behaviour of the market, listed companies and even the regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More international investors, in particular institutional ones, will help. But capital control makes it impossible to further remove the constraints of the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme. The weaker the market is, the more difficult it is to open it up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An offshore A-share market in Hong Kong is the best solution to the deadlock. The A shares will get more international investors, thanks to the reputation and depth of our market. The capital flow of these international investors will be cordoned off from the mainland system, minimising any negative impact on its financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But every pricing signal and corporate vote will be felt by the mainland market. These will eventually translate into healthy pressure on its participants, companies and regulators. At least, that is the wish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This tune sounds all too familiar. We have heard it since the 1993 listing of state-owned enterprises in Hong Kong. Whether bringing in international investors will improve things this time is anybody's guess.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The big question for Hong Kong is what happens when people jump on to the A-share bandwagon with good faith in the integrity and power of our regulatory regime. What damage will it do to our reputation when they realise we have no jurisdiction over the A-share companies?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Try reminding an investor in Sicily of the "buyer beware" warning when a company he or she has invested in is found to have been cooking its books and our regulator cannot get hold of its chairman or its audit papers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Try to tell him or her to wait for the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> (CSRC) to act on the case. The length of the waiting will depend on how well connected the people cooking the books are.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Count the number of mainlanders on our wanted list and one will see this imaginary case isn't too far fetched. And in the case of A-share trading in Hong Kong, our regulator won't even be in a position to put the crooks on the wanted list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be fair, the accord signed by the Hong Kong and mainland regulators promises further co-operation and information sharing to combat insider dealing, false declarations and market manipulation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some optimists also argue that opening up the Shanghai market to foreign investors and, therefore, manipulation, will quickly lead the mainland authorities realise their limits in enforcing their rules offshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To secure help from international regulators, the mainland authorities will align their approach with the rest of the world, according to several regulatory sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sincerity and willingness of mainland authorities such as the CSRC - who care about the well-being of the A-share market - in rooting out the weeds should not be doubted. The problem is most do not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Imagine the CSRC telling the People's Liberation Army to give up its man in relation to a fraud investigation. If it cannot be done now, why will it be different because the stock is trading in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial services minister has warned market players not to expect the quota under the proposed cross-border stock trading scheme to be increased after it is filled, despite complaints that the cap is too low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, April 14</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They call it a through train but this latest scheme to allow limited ownership of Hong Kong shares in the mainland, and vice versa, is like no through train on which I have ever ridden.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a real through train from Shanghai, you would get on at the Shanghai station, having already passed Hong Kong border checks there, and then zip straight through to the Hung Hom station. You would then wonder why you had bothered when, with the traffic jams these days, the short ride home from Hung Hom would take you as long again.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With this new direct share trading arrangement, however, what you get is the milk train, the one that stops at every farmers' village and makes you wonder why anyone ever thought the train was an improvement on the horse. Who really wants to stick money into that dysfunctional market … ?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proper use of a through train metaphor in economic reform is in reform that takes you all way you want to go in one non-stop move. For stock markets it would mean opening the Shanghai market to all investors around the world without restriction and permitting Chinese nationals to invest anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the supposed reform we now have applies to only two exchanges, severely limits the investable amount, both in total and in daily trading quotas, limits the number of stocks in the scheme and limits the agencies through which trading can be conducted. It's a milk train. It stops everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our Securities and Futures Commission will also restrict investors coming through Shanghai to institutions and individuals with at least 500,000 yuan in their trading accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is ironic as such people can, metaphorically speaking, already fly here directly and ignore any train. If they have the money, someone in Hong Kong will always be happy to make them a market in Hong Kong stocks. It is what stockbrokers do. Money dissolves capital flow restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And as to people from Hong Kong investing in Shanghai stocks, the through train will run empty. Who really wants to stick money into that dysfunctional market except for the occasional piece of arbitrage or insider deal?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Assuming that there were truly interest, ha-ha (Hey, David Letterman, I got one for you), we would soon have not reform but the opposite of reform. Things would be made needlessly more complicated as soon as the quota limits are reached. A two-tier market would become a four-tier market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What would happen is that a company with an A-share listing in Shanghai and an H-share listing in Hong Kong would also need a separate direct trade quota listing in Shanghai and a separate direct trade quota listing in Hong Kong. Instead of two prices for the same stock, we would have four. Real reform would reduce it to one price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course the exchanges would probably not set up these separate direct trade boards. They would just leave it to the brokers to do the job privately. The spreads would then go even wider. What fine definitions we have of reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is my belief that this is inevitably the fate of piecemeal reform when a command economy tries to change itself into a market economy. There comes a time in this journey when a deep chasm presents itself on the way forward. Crawling along will then only make you tumble in. You have to run and jump if you are to get to the other side.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Crawling along means making pointless changes that look like reform but, in fact, only make things more inefficient. They multiply the opportunities for corruption and worsen the income polarity of the society. It is what we have with this misnamed through train.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then it becomes increasingly likely that, as in Russia 25 years ago, the authorities will lose control of the process and the final jump to real reform will be made by criminal elements who steal all the economy's resources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our financial services minister, however, will still be trying to make his toy train work.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan could weaken further after wiping out last year's gains, thanks to continued concerns as financial and economic risks still weigh on market sentiment, AXA Investment Managers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The recent depreciation in the past weeks has moderated and was mainly driven my market concerns about economic growth in China. In the near term, the yuan would trade in a soft note should uncertainties in the Chinese economy remain," said Aiden Yao, a senior Asian economist at AXA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ratio of current account surplus to gross domestic product narrowed to just 2 per cent last year, suggesting that there was limited scope for the yuan to further appreciate, Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Trade and current account only play a small part in determining what is really important in the global market. Trade only makes up for 5 per cent of global trading volume, while the rest is capital flow. That is where the big uncertainty is, because China still has a relatively closed capital account," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> yesterday set the reference rate of the yuan at a nine-month low. The onshore yuan rate has lost 2.9 per cent this year in the spot market, while the offshore yuan rate lost 3 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The major force behind the currency's depreciation is the shifting from policy to market-driven factors, as investors turned more bearish on China's economic outlook given questions over shadow banking activities, Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some economists believe that resulted from a policy-induced weakness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese policymakers have been encouraging currency weakness in a move to curb speculative cross-border trades profiting from differences between onshore and offshore foreign exchange rates. But over the past weeks, the decline of the yuan was mainly attributed to market forces, Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is difficult to know how much is by policy and how much is driven by the market," he said. "But if you look at the daily point of the exchange rate, from February to the middle of March, you see a very jumpy move of the exchange rate … that is the policy-driven part.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But very recently, such jumpy moves disappeared and yuan trading has become more moderated. To me, that's consistent with the pessimism over the economy."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese corporates that need to switch to trades settled in renminbi and hedge their yuan exposure amid rising volatilities are seen as one of the next growth points in renminbi business, said Standard Chartered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency surprisingly has lost 3 per cent against the US dollar so far this year, causing massive foreign exchange losses for Chinese corporates who thought of the yuan as a one-way bet and barely bothered with yuan hedging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Vrontamitis, Standard Chartered's regional head of product management for greater China and North East Asia, told the Post that the bank sees see greater potential in helping Chinese corporates switch to settle trade in yuan while also hedging their currency positions to facilitate yuan trades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In 2012 it was about why you should use renminbi and 2013 was about how to use it. This year is about educating Chinese corporates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we want to see the next big growth in renminbi redenomination, they need to be educated," Vrontamitis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Most Chinese corporates haven't had to deal with foreign exchange risks in the past, so these corporates now need to deal with risks and volatility," he said. "They also need to be educated more about the cost-saving benefits of switching to yuan trade."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has abolished almost all the restrictions on capital flow under the current account since announcing a yuan trade pilot scheme in 2010. Since then, trade settlement in yuan has jumped from 2 per cent of trade to 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such rapid growth, however, was not mainly driven by Chinese corporates, but a group of active multinationals, who switched to yuan trade to save on currency conversion costs and hedged their yuan exposure by buying forwards - allowing the renminbi exchange rate to be locked in and protecting themselves from unpredictable gyrations in the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While global corporates embraced the yuan in earnest, the Chinese firms have lagged behind their international counterparts, Vrontamitis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese firms could save between 1 per cent to 3 per cent in costs if they knew the benefits of invoicing in yuan instead of the US dollar," Vrontamitis said, citing central bank data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the projected rise in onshore sales as Chinese domestic consumption grows should also be a factor in these considerations, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The key issues that used to hold back redenomination of dollar trade into renminbi - such as the depth of the foreign exchange market, the ability to hedge, the complexity of cross-border trade and the difficult documentation requirements - have disappeared, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A more volatile yuan should not be a reason that would dent corporates' interest in settling in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Rising (yuan) volatility is causing corporates to want to control the foreign exchange risks … while the breath and depth of the growth of the offshore market has given them the confidence that they can manage those risks," Vrontamitis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Big companies can come in and have large exposure without impacting the market because of the bigger pool," Vrontamitis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The daily turnover of the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market stands at US$26 billion, compared withUS$8 billion in 2012. Standard Chartered saw the rate of redenomination to renminbi- the ratio for corporates to switch to settle trades in the yuan - to rise to 28 per cent by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said in February that it expected the use of the yuan for trade settlement to rise to 30 per cent to 60 per cent of the country's total in the medium term, representing a two- to four-fold increase from the current level.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Finding fresh revenue growth externally through its solid corporate and commercial banking roots in Hong Kong ranks as the top priority on the to-do list of </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">'s first female chief executive in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">May Tan, who took on the top job at the start of this month, joined the emerging markets-focused bank in 2009 through its takeover of the Asian unit of British broker </span><span class="s3">Cazenove</span><span class="s1">, which underwrote the bank's Hong Kong listing in 2002.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an interview, she laid out her vision for the future, highlighting opportunities in the mainland's nascent capital markets and fast-growing yuan business as the engines of profit, since trading conditions in financial markets have been tough.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland economy and its developing capital market offered lots of new business for the bank in both equity and bond offerings, said Tan, who gained a wealth of knowledge about regional financial markets as </span><span class="s3">Cazenove</span><span class="s1">'s Asia chief for more than a decade from 1993.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a gradual shift to an advice-driven, fee-based model, Tan said new business from medium-sized initial public offerings of mainland firms, the rollout of preference shares and the undeveloped bond market in Hong Kong seemed the most promising given the bank's strong network of corporate clients.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"My experience in capital markets helps me understand the dynamics and client needs better," said Tan, who orchestrated a successful integration between the commercial bank and equity broker in 2008 when the collapse of </span><span class="s3">Lehman Brothers</span><span class="s1"> almost brought down the global financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was an honourable deal since </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> did not change its bid price for </span><span class="s3">Cazenove</span><span class="s1"> even after the Lehman crisis," said Tan, who managed 200 regional staff for the broker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite her optimism in capital markets, the London-headquartered group warned earlier that its first-half operating profit could fall 20 per cent, blaming difficult trading conditions in financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Second-quarter results from US banking giants </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> showed lower trading revenue in both their equities and fixed-income, currency and commodities units, sending a clear message to executives that the landscape remains challenging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan, who reports to Benjamin Hung, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">'s chief executive for the greater China region, said its yuan business had been an unexpected beneficiary of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), a US law intended to detect and deter tax evasion by US citizens holding bank accounts overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In bilateral trade activities, renminbi has emerged as the preferred currency, especially when settlement in the Chinese currency avoids burdensome reporting from Fatca," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland companies that needed to switch to trades settled in yuan and hedge their yuan exposure amid rising volatility were seen as one of the next growth points in yuan business, the bank said earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has abolished almost all restrictions on capital flow under the current account since announcing a yuan trade pilot scheme in 2010. Trade settlements in yuan have since jumped from 2 per cent of the mainland's trade to 20 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months of this year, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> ranked second to </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> in the league table for offshore yuan bonds, raising 40.1 billion yuan (HK$50 billion) in 126 deals, according to Thomson Reuters. The bank dropped one notch to sixth in the Asian G3 currency bond market for Asia ex-Japan region, raising US$6.4 billion in 43 transactions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange's top man has pronounced the fledgling market link with Shanghai a success despite a disproportionate flow of northbound investments that has prompted a vow to step up promotions across the border.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We could do more promotional and investor education to mainland investors to let them know more about the Hong Kong market and its stocks," Chow Chung-kong, the chairman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the low turnover for southbound trades under the through train did not mean the scheme, which was launched on Monday to high hopes after a delayed start, was not successful.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are not technical problems and the cross-border trading has worked very smoothly since the launch," Chow said at a media briefing. "We may only have taken a very small step. But with a small step after another small step, we will develop an active market eventually."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said its long-term success depended on international traders' interest in the mainland market and mainlanders' appetite for overseas investment. "Hong Kong will have a role to play in this capital flow," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first three trading days under the scheme have been marked by a strong push by international institutional investors into the A-share market, but with relatively few mainlanders taking the opportunity to trade Hong Kong stocks directly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Northbound turnover stood at 2.84 billion yuan (HK$3.6 billion) yesterday, using up 21 per cent of the daily quota of 13 billion yuan as calculated on a net basis. Southbound turnover was HK$495.92 million, filling just 2.4 per cent of the 10.5 billion yuan quota.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adrian Mowat, chief Asian and emerging-markets equity strategist for </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, said northbound flows would likely continue to outpace Hong Kong-bound investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In talking to local brokers and counterparties of </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> on the mainland, they have always highlighted there was limited interest from retail investors to go into Hong Kong," Mowat said, citing a key impediment that mainlanders must have at least 500,000 yuan to trade in the scheme, while many such clients already trade in Hong Kong through local brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think that southbound flows will push up the </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index … We do expect money in the savings pool to move into China equities but investors probably will continue to focus on A shares."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said yesterday that retail investors had accounted for most of the southbound trade, which covered 96 per cent of the 268 Hong Kong stocks qualified for the scheme on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Northbound trade was dominated by institutional investors, which focused on the bigger stocks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Beijing's first official reaction to the continuing rouble rout, the foreign exchange regulator said it is closely monitoring the situation, while downplaying its impact on the mainland's economy and capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts said China, the world's largest energy consumer, may feel the pain, too, if the turmoil spreads further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The reasons behind the rouble's slump are very complicated. The international and domestic communities are paying close attention to it," said Wang Yonggui, director-general of the policy and regulations department at the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The impact of the crash has yet to play out completely and is subject to further assessment," he said. "China's economic fundamentals and capital flow remain very stable and healthy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rouble crashed to record lows this week despite the </span><span class="s3">Russian central bank</span><span class="s1">'s dramatic interest rate increase on Tuesday to 17 per cent from 10.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Sanctions, declines in real incomes and real rates above 7 per cent will cause a deep recession in 2015," said analysts at AXA Investment Managers in a research note. Currencies of other major oil producers in South America have also seen a sharp slide. Emerging countries in Asia have taken a heavy hit from capital outflows as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Monan, a researcher at the China Centre for International Economic Exchange, told the Post that even China, which had US$3.89 trillion of foreign exchange reserves as of the end of September, could be hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If needed, she said, the BRICS New Development Bank could provide liquidity through its US$100 billion contingency reserve arrangement aimed at preventing crises. But she added that the effectiveness of this new mechanism is untested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many people thought China would benefit from the slump in oil prices. However, China needs to stay alert against sharp fluctuations in the global foreign-exchange and bond markets, which are closely linked to the commodities market," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang, however, played down the downward pressure the yuan has been facing of late as the US dollar strengthens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China has still in general seen a net inflow of forex funds," he said. "The yuan exchange rate is displaying a two-way fluctuation. We need not be overly concerned about capital outflows in some individual months."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But domestic problems, such as mounting local government debt and weakening growth, coupled with the US tapering of its monetary easing programme are complicating the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> cut interest rates for the first time in two years in November to ease funding costs and stabilise growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The central bank is facing a dilemma now," Zhang said. "It may be wary of lowering interest rates again as that may speed up capital outflows amid narrowing chance for arbitrage."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A buying spree by mainland Chinese investors on Thursday drove the total market turnover to hit a record high for the second day running at HK$293.90 billion while the southbound turnover of the stock through train scheme also hit another record high at HK$26.09 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index soared 707. 53 points or by 2.7 per cent to finish Thursday at 26,944.39, having touched a 52-week intra-day top during the session of 27,922.67.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The index has soared to levels last seen in 2007, just before capital markets crashed in the global financial crisis of 2008. Year-to-date, the </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> is up nearly 15 per cent.??</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 10.5 billion yuan daily quota of the stocks through train scheme connecting Shanghai and Hong Kong was used up by 1.45 pm local time on Thursday, the second day in a row that buying by mainland Chinese investors ?had to be suspended before the market close at ?4 pm because the daily quota ran out. ?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">?Southbound turnover ??mainland investors buying and selling Hong Kong stocks ??stood at a record HK$26.09 billion at the market close on Thursday, easily eclipsing Wednesday's then record turnover of HK$21 billion.READ MORE:?Hong Kong stocks surge over 5pc as Chinese funds flood the market</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The daily quota is calculated on a net basis so turnover could be bigger than the quota limit. Once the quota is hit for the day, there can be no more buying for the rest of the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scheme allow cross-border trading and capital flow up to a total of 550 billion yuan. The southbound flow is capped at 10.5 billion yuan a day and 250 billion yuan in total, while the northbound flow ??international investors buying A shares listed in Shanghai ??is capped at 13 billion yuan a day and 300 billion yuan in total.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors on the mainland piled into local stocks on Wednesday after a three-day holiday break ?on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the Easter and Ching Ming holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China exchanges were closed for only one day and during that time the valuation gap between mainland-listed A shares and H shares ??the Hong Kong-listed stocks of mainland companies ??widened by 4.47 per cent. Investors have looked to cash in on that discount.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These are basically the same things that supported today's rally,??said Louis Wong, a director at Phillip Securities in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing led the rally on Thursday, rising 9 per cent to close at HK$239.8. Tencent Technologies climbed 4.27 per cent to finish at HK$161.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China CNR Corp</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">CSR Corp</span><span class="s1"> were the biggest gainers in trading on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China fund houses last week gained regulatory approval to invest in Hong Kong stocks, another factor that helped deliver the record southbound trading volume which has always been weaker than the northbound flow of money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The northbound quota stood at 138 per cent, showing there were more selling orders than buying orders from international investors trading A shares via Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Northbound turnover was about 11.99 billion yuan at the market close while the Shanghai Composite Index was down by about 0.93 per cent. That followed the highest volume of northbound funds at 13.9 billion yuan on Wednesday since the two markets were linked in November.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We must keep a sober mind and realise that the downward pressure is increasing ..."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premier Li Keqiang,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, April 15</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some years ago, when he was not yet Premier, Mr Li offered a sober assessment of mainland economic statistics. He said he trusted only the figures on electricity consumption, railway freight loadings and foreign trade in goods.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was speaking somewhat in jest, but not entirely, and I shall take him at his word. How do his three benchmarks look now?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The blue line in the first chart shows you the year-on-year growth rate of electricity consumption in the mainland, smoothed out here with a six-month moving average because it would otherwise look like a seismograph record in an earthquake. I quite agree with the emphasis Mr Li gives this statistic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Everywhere in the world it is a good proxy for economic growth. It is up to date and it can be precisely measured so that government cannot easily fudge it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And yes, Mr Li has some reason to invoke sobriety. The growth rate stands at only 2.8 per cent. Note in particular the dip into negative territory in early 2009 when the official figures said the economy was still growing at 6.6 per cent. It was minus 5, said the electricity numbers. I refer you to my thoughts on fudge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I am not so sure, however, about railway freight loadings. Most land transportation of freight in the mainland is now on highways. The red line in the chart representing the railway figures may thus overstate the sobriety case. Nonetheless, notice how closely it approximates the ups and downs of electricity consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I am sure it still speaks an element of truth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And now we go to foreign trade in goods where one statistic rings the alarm bells for me more loudly than the electricity and freight figures do. Over the last year there has been an enormous surge in the goods trade balance. It now runs at a jaw-dropping surplus of US$500 billion a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forget the concerns about mainland export growth. It is actually rising while still declining for the rest of Asia. The problem is a big drop in imports, which implies massive destocking across the economy. The implication here is also that a countervailing increase in capital outflows last year has become much greater.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You have to read the signs of it from these trade figures because capital flow figures are only published long after the event and even then are hidden in service imports and supposed errors in calculating the balance of payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the evidence of capital flight is certainly growing stronger at the moment and matters are not helped when the latest monetary figures show an ever more severe pinch on liquidity with M2 growth at only 9.8 per cent, the lowest I can see on record.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, a young yahoo punter on the Shanghai market buys an 8 million yuan (HK$10 million) Lamborghini with his recent speculative winnings and quickly wrecks it in late-night road racing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Nero fiddles while Rome burns.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's exchange rate strategy is once again in the spotlight amid renewed talk of the need for a weaker currency as the central bank looks for effective tools to revive the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, market players argue that Beijing may continue to stick to a stable yuan strategy in order to meet its capital reform goals, even at the cost of hurting the economy in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A strong currency was one of the key factors to blame for unexpected tumbles in mainland imports and exports in April, with analysts having expected a rebound from depressed levels in February and March. </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> followed up with its third interest rate cut in six months on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has weakened by around 0.59 per cent against the US dollar since July. But the euro and yen, the currencies of the mainland's second- and third-biggest trading partners, have weakened against the greenback by 18 per cent and 15 per cent since then. As a result, the yuan has risen by around 13 per cent against a basket of US dollars, euros and yen in the period, according to DBS.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players say there could be a short-term correction for the yuan against the US dollar, with the central bank intervening less in the currency market by setting weaker benchmark midpoint prices. However, Beijing is seen as likely to embrace only relatively limited change in its currency strategy, at least until the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> completes its review of the currency's eligibility to join the special drawing rights (SDR) basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Short-term correction is highly likely, but people should not over read," DBS economist Nathan Chow said. "China would not join the currency war. The dynamics of Chinese exports are a lot different from a decade ago - more and more Chinese manufacturers are moving their production base outside the mainland and that means a stronger currency won't help them."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said DBS was working on raising its year-end target price for USD/CNY to a stronger level, with the US dollar likely to rise more slowly as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is expected to delay interest rate increases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan weakened by 0.03 per cent, or 19 basis points, to 6.2102 against the greenback yesterday, the weakest level in two weeks, while the offshore yuan lost 0.01 per cent, or 4 basis points, to 6.2117.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1"> economist Chang Jian said in December that the yuan was overvalued by 10 per cent to 15 per cent - which was dragging down economic growth by half a percentage point a year, yet Beijing seems to be tolerating this damage as the cost of opening up its capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another factor that might make the central bank reluctant to see a sharp decline in the yuan is the risk of capital outflow. The mainland's foreign exchange watchdog said in its annual report released yesterday that it would see "two-way moves" of capital flow in financial and capital accounts this year. The mainland's foreign reserves shrank by US$263 billion between July and March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market forces would seem to predict a lower yuan on the back of lower interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Normally, with interest rates being cut on the mainland and the United States expected to raise rates this year, there would be a natural weakening of demand for yuan and strengthening of demand for the US dollar, as mainland savings and government securities became relatively less appealing investments due to falling returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some market analysts said that spread impact might be limited due to the fact the mainland's capital markets were largely closed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China's capital account is still more closed than others, and hence the transmission between interest rates and FX is much looser than it may be for other currencies," </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> economists led by Qu Hongbin said. "In fact, if the policy easing improves investor sentiment because of better economic growth prospects, it may actually support the RMB broadly and offset the impact of reduced carry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The current calming of the USD bull run is creating balanced flow pressures for the renminbi, making both cyclical easing and structural reform more palatable in the near term."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> currency strategist Eddie Cheung echoed those sentiments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Currently, two factors are offsetting the negative FX impact from a rate cut," he said. "The first is the upcoming SDR review by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">, before which I think the central bank would like to keep the currency steady. The second is the market is taking it as a positive hint that the central bank is using additional measures to prop up the economy."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On July 21, 2005, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> freed the yuan from its 8.28 peg to the US dollar and allowed the currency to appreciate by 2.1 per cent.The daily fixing should cease tracking the USD, be more transparent, market-determined, and less influenced by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank</span><span class="s1"> of ChinaPaul Mackel, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The removal of the peg did not see the yuan become a free float currency, instead entering into what Heng describes as a 'managed float' against the US dollar. </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> announces a mid-price for the yuan at 9.15am each trading day, with traders able to trade up or down in a set band. The range was originally set at 0.3 per cent either side of the mid-price, before being widened to 0.5 per cent in May 2007, 1 per cent in April 2012 and 2 per cent in March last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past 10 years the yuan has appreciated 25 per cent from 8.28 to 6.20 to the US dollar, a level Heng said it was likely to maintain in the near term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">) has now finally suggested that the onshore yuan may be near its neutral valuation," he said. "However, the </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> continues to reiterate its long running view that the onshore yuan needs to appreciate further."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heng said Beijing would implement more reforms because it wanted to see the yuan become widely used and eventually become a reserve currency held by central banks around the world. Since 2009, it has allowed the international use of the yuan to settle trade and issue bonds, insurance and other products. A stock connect scheme linking Hong Kong and Shanghai was launched in November last year, allowing 550 billion yuan of cross-border trading, while a new link with Shenzhen is expected to be launched later this year. A cross-border fund sales scheme capped at 600 billion yuan was launched at the start of this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The near term focus of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> is to encourage the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> to add the yuan into its Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket this October," Heng said. "But that is by no means the end game. Over the long run, it is clear that for the yuan to mature into a global reserve currency of true weight that can rival the US dollar and euro, the Chinese authorities need to take a leap of faith and allow the yuan to trade freely with no pre-determined daily trading band and China's capital account needs to be opened up fully for free, two-way investment capital flow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Mackel, head of global emerging markets foreign exchange research at </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, also expects Beijing to introduce more currency reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There could be important changes to the onshore USD-CNY trading band via the reference rate, and/or the width of the band," Mackel said in a research report. "The daily fixing should cease tracking the USD, be more transparent, market-determined, and less influenced by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">. Such reforms will take time."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mackel said he believed Beijing would first widen the trading band to allow more room for the spot exchange rate to move. Then he expected Beijing might allow the onshore yuan USD/CNY to eventually converge with the offshore yuan USD/CNH into a single floating exchange rate as cross-border capital flow channels were widened and the offshore market deepened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The offshore USD-CNH exchange rate is not bound by the trading band and is already very much market-determined," he said. "We have recently observed that it occasionally leads developments in the onshore exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The steps taken towards full convertibility will also have played a vital role in reforms of China's domestic economy and financial system. We believe the inclusion in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket will be inevitable, meaning the yuan will have gone from a hard peg behind tight capital controls only a decade ago to being an anchor of global trade, investment and finance."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's decision to widen the yuan's trading band marks the government's latest effort to push ahead with market reforms to increase the yuan's chances of being included in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s currency basket later this year despite the backdrop of a weakening economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business, July 27</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Big hopes indeed, but it seems to me that you don't have much widening to speak of in a widened currency trading band when that currency itself is frozen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Look at the first chart of the yuan to US dollar rate since the beginning of this year and tell me that the word "frozen" does not describe the track of this exchange rate over the past four months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bear in mind that we are looking at a period during which the Shanghai stock market was at last partially opened to foreigners, then took off like a rocket and as suddenly crashed. Cross your heart and tell me it is entirely normal for the currency in which a market is denominated to hold absolutely firm in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tell me also that it would be unusual for consistent reports of deepening economic gloom on most fronts to have any impact on this currency. I'm a good listener.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And while we are looking at the news, here is a ding-ding alarm bell to another statistic that will have to come out soon and makes such a stable exchange rate all the more unusual.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/2015/07/27/206dba1d8272579fea128aa3b1b49aba.jpg]Figures for merchandise trade balance and foreign reserves, two key components of the balance of payments, have now been published for the second quarter. They make it possible to estimate private capital flows for the quarter with reasonable accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second chart shows you the trend. Taking errors and omissions as being capital flow (any economist will tell you this is a safe assumption), investment capital is now fleeing China on a net basis at a rate of US$458 billion a year. Nothing like this has ever been seen before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nor, I am sure, has any country in the world ever seen such a stark reversal in capital movements with no impact on its currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What we have here is evidence that the authorities are actively manipulating the yuan's exchange rate, either to create the appearance of a stable financial system or in the hopes that freezing the exchange rate will itself help make this financial system stable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I can understand why they are tempted to do it although it increasingly looks like a desperation measure and I doubt that they can keep it up indefinitely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But what I cannot understand is why they should then still indulge in talk of widening the yuan's trading band as if things were still exactly the same as four years ago and gradual strengthening of the currency to buy off obstreperous American politicians was still the order of the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The game has changed. A weaker yuan is now as likely as a stronger yuan and who wants to be in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s seniors' club when all it means is an obligation to lose greater sums of money in Greece?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Someone needs to install a wake-up clock at the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> devalued the yuan on Tuesday, setting the daily mid point yuan trading price a record 1.86 per cent weaker at 6.2298 to the US dollar in the clearest sign yet the government may let the currency soften after worsening economic data and a stuttering stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign exchange markets reacted immediately with the onshore yuan trading 1.41 per cent weaker at 6.2970 against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The international economic and financial conditions are very complex. The US dollar is strengthening, while the Euro and Japanese Yen are weakening. Emerging market and commodities currencies are facing downward pressure, and we are seeing increasing volatilities in international capital flow," a spokesman for </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, told the media Tuesday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan had "deviated the from market rate to a large extent and with a larger duration, which, to some extent, has undermined the market benchmark status," the spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan trading band is tightly controlled. </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set a daily mid point around which the currency can trade up or down 2 per cent each day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This latest development follows an announcement two weeks ago that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would widen the yuan daily trading band, without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before Tuesday, the government had resisted calls from economists to let the currency sink lower as a way to help boost parts of the economy, even as exports crumbled and the country's stock market shrank by 30 per cent. Weekend data revealed an 8.3 per cent year on year decline in China's exports for July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I am not surprised at all. The Chinese government will let the renminbi weaken gradually. It will keep doing this policy easing, including cutting interest rates" to help the economy, said William Mo, Tung Shing Securities vice president.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> poised to hike interest rates possibly as soon as next month, the US dollar will only get stronger, said Mo, increasing the pressure on China to give the yuan more freedom to trade lower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts had previously said the government wanted the currency stable ahead of possible inclusion into the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s reserve currency basket. People might also try and switch yuan into foreign currencies if the yuan was to start weakening, setting off capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The PBOC spokesman also said there would be further "market-orientation" and that the central bank was now soliciting quotations from market makers before setting the mid price - a first for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> said analysts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/2015/09/04/prop-hk.jpg]Hong Kong home prices could fall by 5 per cent to 10 per cent over the next three years, according to JP Morgan, which warned of the risks of an economic slowdown in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A slowdown marked by falling retail sales and a softening mainland economy would adversely affect home purchasing power and buying desire, saidCusson Leung, head of conglomerates and property research at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung told a press briefing on Friday there were a number of factors that could affect the performance of Hong Kong property market, such as credit leverage and capital flow, while adding that he did not see any immediate risk of over-leveraging of real estate or capital outflow.The unemployment rate is expected to riseCusson Leung, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he raised concerns over a potential slowdown of the city's economy, linked to the risk of further decline in the mainland China economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Retail sales are declining and international brands are talking about network consolidation in Hong Kong,” he said. "The unemployment rate is expected to rise.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung said the impact of the negative factors would become more obvious early next year. “2016 will be a more difficult year when compared with 2015. Home prices could see a decline,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While saying that </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> had not yet reached a house view on the degree of home price falls, he said it was possible prices could drop by 5 per cent to 10 per cent a year over the next three years, starting from next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong home prices rose 13.5 per cent last year and 8 per cent in the first half of this year, according to the data from the Rating and Valuation Department.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung said home prices were unlikely to see a sharp plunge of 30 per cent in a year unless a crisis or really bad unexpected news hit the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Residential transactions in Hong Kong last month plunged 27.8 per cent month on month to 3,896, according to Land Registry data released on Wednesday, prompting some analysts to predict a modest decline in home prices in the second half of this year. Alva To, senior managing director of real estate services firm DTZ/</span><span class="s3">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span><span class="s1">, predicted home prices could see a decline of 5 per cent to 10 per cent from current levels this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung, however, expects prices to remain stable this year, but begin falling next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Centaline Property Agency said its secondary home price index hit a record high of 146.78 yesterday, up 0.91 per cent week on week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decline in property transactions in the past two months was more related to a slowdown in project releases than the wealth effect from the stock market crash, Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments came a day after </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1"> sold out all 328 flats at phase two of its Century Link development in Tung Chung.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment into real estate in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is expected to remain on an uptrend in 2016, in spite of the volatility in China that could weigh negatively on mainland insurance companies, state-owned enterprises and private investors, according to </span><span class="s3">Colliers International</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The upbeat outlook comes amid what's anticipated to be a record year for the European market, with this year on track to top 2007 in terms of inflows of capital by domestic and international investors,the property consultant said in its third quarter EMEA Capital Flow Report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These investors channeled €135 billion into European real estate assets in the first half, up 37 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The second half of the year typically represents a busier trading period, so European real estate investment levels should surpass those reached at the previous 2007 peak," Colliers said in the report</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report shows the Asian investment into European real estates increased notably from 2010, with the pace of acquisitions accelerating from €4.2 billion in 2010 to reach a peak of €13.1billion in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Colliers said it did not see any evidence that the "Asian wave" of capital flows were diminishing.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou Xiaochuan is China's longest-serving central bank governor and his ambition could provide a powerful goad for financial reform of the country's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday, his remarks in an article that the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock exchanges would forge a link before the years' end took the markets by surprise and caused gyrations in what eventually turned out to be a PR blunder by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While analysts said this was just the latest case showing the overlapping and contradictory responsibilities of departments in China's government, there is no mistaking that Zhou is a man in a hurry to pry open China's capital markets before his retirement which could come at any time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stocks, especially in Hong Kong, shot up because the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect has been widely consigned by market players to start in 2016 after a massive rout scuppered a rally that hoisted shares in the city and on mainland China to a 7-year peak in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> clarified during the lunch break that Zhou's comments were actually an extract from a speech he delivered nearly six months ago to staff on "party education".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A key industry source very familiar with the progress of the scheme said that stock market watchdog, the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> was still working on the scheme and was not prepared to issue a timetable to roll it out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A senior analyst with a state-owned brokerage, said the dramatic incident just showed how </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and CSRC have overlapping responsibilities, but the bank is more aggressive than the latter in terms of pushing for reforms. It looks the CSRC is the direct designer and regulator of the "stock" connect. But the settlement issue, related to cross-boarder capital flow, is under the supervision of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Zhou Xiaochuan is absolutely more close to the party's core deciding body, while the CSRC is marginalized," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Erwin Sanft, chief China strategist at Macquarie, said </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and the Ministry of Finance are more senior, powerful entities who are the major drivers of financial reforms in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They have been, since the beginning of the year, and continue to be, driving financial reform and deregulation. They also didn't take active roles in the stock market intervention," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of news reports the past two weeks shows China is racing to tick the boxes for "full convertibility" although the definition of "full" remains arguable, said Li Yimin, a macro-economy analyst with Shenwan Hongyuan Securities based in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last March, Zhou stated that China would strive to achieve basic capital account convertibility by the year end. He reiterated this target in April at the IMF-World Bank meeting in Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The task has also been pegged high up on the ruling party's agenda as China strives for inclusion of the yuan into the basket of Special Drawing Right. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> rejected China's request in 2010, largely because the yuan is not "used freely".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest move encouraged by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> came this week as </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> announced setting up a majority-owned joint venture brokerage, the first of this kind in the country in Qianhai, a pilot free trade zone based in southeast China's Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has managed to do so by exploiting an agreement under CEPA designed to encourage financial integration between Hong Kong and mainland China. Its competitors were forced to settle for minority stakes in their joint venture brokerages and are struggling to fit into the local culture and turn a profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> won't do it only because the regulation allows it to. It should be doing it because it can, or will be able to do more in the near future," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, said the venture would enable the bank to underwrite renminbi-denominated bonds for companies in China and back shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China also opened its US$5.7 trillion interbank bond market to foreign central banks and sovereign bonds in July. Last Friday, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> released a statement with other ministry-level authorities including the Ministry of Commerce, emphasising Shanghai would spearhead the move to make the yuan convertible under the capital account in its pilot free-trade zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is supported to set up a financial assets trading platform open to international investors, to orderly draw offshore long-term funds into trading the onshore stocks, bonds, and funds, and to explore opening the IPO markets to offshore institutional investors," the statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came just several hours after Charles Li, the CEO of the Hong Kong Exchange &amp; Clearing, called on the inclusion of IPOs in the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which started almost a year ago and doesn't yet allow investors to access initial share sales.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is unlikely that China will literally tick all the boxes before this year-end, but the push is really strong, as the central bank eased control on its currency exchange rate since August 11," said Li-gang Liu, chief economist for Greater China, </span><span class="s3">ANZ Bank</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shootings and bombings that killed more than 132 people in Paris touched the nerves of Chinese investors more than usual, as many fret worried investors will accelerate pulling their money from emerging markets and plunking them down into safer assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The nature of the attacks suggests an escalation in the intensity of the terrorist threat and geopolitical risks. It may strongly enhance the risk-off sentiment, given investors are already adjusting their portfolio to catch up with the US rate hike, said Hong Hao, managing director with Bocom International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The uncertainties of war and potential terror on other international cities are impossible to quantify. Non-commercial traders' long dollar positions seem light given geopolitical risks," he said, noting investors tend to increase their exposure to the US currency for at least the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The dollars' strength will continue to pressure commodities, emerging markets and other riskier assets. Fund flows to onshore and offshore China ETFs already appear to be rolling over, for example."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yimin, a senior macro economist with Shenwan Hongyuan Securities based in Beijing, said the influence of the Paris attack may exceed peoples' expectations, as it indicated an escalated terrorism threat, and would accelerate capital flow to safe haven assets including the US currency in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, capital outflow pressure for China seems coming back again since November, as EPFR data shows a net US$662 million flew out of China last week. This came after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> and other Chinese financial institutions reported net foreign currency purchases worth US$2 billion, a sign of capital inflows in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is also following closely its campaign to become a reserve currency in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">, which is due to hand down its decision on November 30.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We understand the SDR campaign is high up on the political agenda for party leaders, but the more pressing issue is the US rate hike. The membership of the SDR is unlikely to reverse the capital outflow and yuan devaluation momentum," said an unnamed economist work with a state-owned bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts outside China tend to read less into the terror attack in Paris, while having their attention focused on the upcoming Fed meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The markets will step away from this tragedy and look to the Fed for the most meaningful near term impact. Japan's disappointing GDP number today suggest more monetary easing and that will be coupled with </span><span class="s3">ECB</span><span class="s1"> continued easing these are the narratives that will take the attention away from Paris soon enough," Brett Mcgonegal, chief executive of Reorient Group, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Personally, I do not think the Paris incident will necessarily become a trigger for major capital outflows. As you can see, the global stock market correction was mostly subdued," said Kay Van Petersen, vice president of Saxo Capital Markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the real risk, or a game change will come if another attack breaks out in Europe or the US."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Islamist group ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris, has warned Paris is only the beginning and that it would launch attacks in other major cities and in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outside China, risk-off trading has been spreading across Asia last week on worries the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will raise US interest rates for the first time in a decade at its December meeting and a disappointing flow of macro data, said a note issued by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The MSCI Asia Pacific Ex Japan Index slid 3 per cent in the past week, led by the fall in Taiwan's stock market. Taiwan had seen the biggest weekly capital outflow in 20 months. The Korean won and Malaysian ringgit depreciated 2 per cent against the US dollar, the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Haefele, the global chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management said the Paris attack and other recent tragic events including atrocities in Turkey and Lebanon and the heightened degree of uncertainties are likely to "lead to higher volatility for markets in the near-term", although how long-lasting the effects will be depends on a lot of factors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For context, Spanish consumer confidence took three months to recover from the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and overseas arrivals into the US took more than six years to recover after 9/11," he wrote in a note on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Flooding the market in recent years, investors from China are expected to continue buying up properties in Australia - despite a weakening Australian dollar and a slowing Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investment into Australia's real estate market has increased dramatically and is only forecast to grow, analysts say. From January to September this year, capital flows from China to Australia's commercial real estate market rose to US$3.4 billion for deals over US$10 million, more than triple what was seen during the same period in 2014, according to latest figures from global property consultancy CBRE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Australia's market attracted about 15 per cent of the total capital flow from China to the global real estate market, which amounted to US$10.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Overall, we are seeing the continued demand for outbound investment among the Chinese. Within the Asia Pacific, Australia is definitely one of the top destinations," said Ada Choi, senior director of research at CBRE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among developed economies - and particularly in contrast to some European countries - Australia is considered to be doing quite well, Choi said. As a result, Australia continues to be an attractive destination for investors looking to diversify their portfolio, and has a market largely driven by foreign capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign investors, including those from China, also dominate the residential market. In Melbourne, the share of apartment sales from overseas buyers is about 30 per cent, according to statistics from </span><span class="s3">National Australia Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alan Oster, group chief economist at National Australia Bank, said that overseas investors are estimated to make up about 20 per cent of the auction market in Melbourne and about 60 per cent of the apartment market in the city's central business district.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In Australia, everyone says Australian property is really expensive (but) by Chinese standards anyway, it's very cheap," Oster said, adding that the weakening Australian dollar also means that property is 30 per cent cheaper than it was two years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While a declining currency rate boosts commercial property returns for existing foreign investors, some are concerned that buying property during a fall in the Australian dollar can pose a currency risk - meaning that they may lose out if they purchase now, as property prices may continue to slide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet Choi said that the exchange risk should be minimal because the currency may begin to stabilise. A lot of foreign investors going into Australia are also looking to enter the market in the long term, and exchange rate fluctuations have limited long run impact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top investors going into Australia will also consider hedging in order to protect themselves from the decline, Choi added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm not saying there's no further exchange rate risk," Choi said. "But overall, the exchange risk should be minimised after such a big decline in the past two or three years."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Communist Party's commitment to raising the mainland's per capita income in its next five-year plan will provide great business opportunities for Hong Kong finance companies, but they will need to think and prepare ahead, a local financial sector veteran says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has prospered as a financial hub for decades by directing offshore investment to the mainland and serving as a springboard for mainland companies looking to go global.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, as the mainland pushes ahead with further opening up of its capital markets, from launching free-trade zones to enhancing the convertibility of its currency, some people argue the city will lose the bonus it used to enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"No players in Hong Kong will be as naive as believing that the current business environment will just continue forever," William Leung, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1"> (SHKF), said. "For my company, my objective is to run faster than China opens up."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A plenum of top party leaders in late October sketched out the guidelines for the next five-year plan, including doubling the mainland's per capita income from the level in 2010, avoiding the middle-income trap, and also doubling gross domestic product from the 2010 level to 54.2 trillion yuan.Everybody has his own way to get their money to Hong Kong, and local banks and brokerage houses are happy to serve themWilliam Leung, </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung said the targets were about creating more well-off people and more successful companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Communist Party will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding in 2021, the year following the completion of the 13th five-year plan, which means Beijing will be very serious about reaching the targets and putting on a good show," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Industry players in Hong Kong had always been pragmatic and adaptable, Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SHKF changed hands in June, when </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> sold a 70 per cent stake to Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">Everbright Securities</span><span class="s1">, one of the mainland's top 10 securities companies, which is controlled by state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Established in 1969, SHKF held stakes in several foreign companies including </span><span class="s3">Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> in the 1970s, through which it shared connections and resources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Leung said serious challenges to its status began a few years ago, as smaller rivals received injections of mainland capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1">, the mainland's second-largest brokerage, purchased local Tai Fok Securities in 2010 and restructured it into </span><span class="s3">Haitong International Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung said such companies benefited as their mainland parent companies brought in new sources of clients, while still being able to capitalise on the strengths of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he hoped Everbright's connections on the mainland would result in SHKF's percentage of mainland clients - both individual and institutional - growing from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in two or three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rich mainlanders started to transfer their wealth to Hong Kong in large quantities from around 2009, Leung said. Demand was still climbing, with alarm bells ringing over further depreciation of the yuan, making the well-off even keener to diversify their investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Cross-border capital flow was not free back then, or even by now, but everybody has his own way to get their money to Hong Kong, and local banks and brokerage houses are happy to serve them," Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-border money transfers by mainland individuals are officially capped at US$ 50,000 a year, but Beijing is mulling over a pilot scheme called QDII2 which could give individuals the option of investing up to half the total value of their assets in international financial assets. Many analysts expect the scheme will kick off next year, as the central government pushes ahead with the opening of the capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the mainland people look out for investment, the first destination will be Hong Kong," Leung said. "But we need to think about what's next - what is the next destination, what is the preferred financial market, and make sure our products and services are available."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SHKF had opened up offices in Sydney and Europe, Leung said, and its familiarity with Western markets could lead customers further afield if they were not satisfied with pure exposure to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for competition from larger international banks and asset management companies, Leung said Hong Kong companies were used to it and could find a space to survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are always more flexible and faster," he said. "We can call each customer by name. However, big companies are like aircraft carriers. It takes an hour for an aircraft carrier to turn around."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's 13th five-year plan, a blueprint for the nation's development from 2016 to 2020, will be finalised at the annual session of the National People's Congress in March.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> is expected to make a statement early Friday evening on the whereabouts of its Chairman, Guo Guangchang, almost 24 hours since he disappeared, according to individuals familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three sources at Fosun said the company would make a public announcement after 7.00pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The whereabouts of Guo is unknown, however speculation on social media suggested that he was taken away for investigation on Thursday afternoon at the Shanghai international airport upon his return from Hong Kong. Seven companies controlled by Fosun in Shanghai and Hong Kong announced trading suspension on Friday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fosun's official spokesperson did not reply to questions from the South China Morning Post by the time of publication.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Fosun officials said Guo was allowed to make phone calls but his personal freedom is restricted, although it remains unknown whether Guo was detained on corruption charges or was assisting in probes into other people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fosun Group CEO Liang Xinjun said he was handling operations in Guo's absence, according to comments he made in the micro-blogging site wechat on Thursday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Haifeng, general manager of the public relations department of Fosun Group, declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo is viewed as a very hands-on manager, prone even to micro managing small decisions relating to his sprawling business empire.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, financial institutions are believed to be growing increasingly anxious for more details on what's happened to Guo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One official at Fosun said bankers have been applying pressure upon the company for a clear explanation as soon as possible, said an official with Fosun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Fosun has very big capital flow in and out every single day," the official said. "It would be problematic if he could not sign critical documents. It could be even more problematic if we do not know for what and for how long he will be away."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Williamson, Managing Director and head of the Global Forensic and Dispute Services team in Hong Kong and China at </span><span class="s3">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</span><span class="s1">, said in mainland Chinese businesses culture, it's not uncommon to authority concentrated towards one person. However the loss of such an individual would carry significant risk to the organisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the company a contingency plan in place, then the disruption to operations will be mitigated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five mainland China listed companies controlled by Fosun announced trading suspension early Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Hong Kong listed companies, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical and Foson International also announced trading suspension in the morning, pending "an announcement containing inside information."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Reuters data, </span><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> investors include Blackrock, Eastspring Investments and </span><span class="s3">Dimensional Fund Advisors</span><span class="s1">. Spokespersons for these three investment firms said it was company policy not to comment on individual stocks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US decision to raise interest rates will have some impact on China's trade, but how much is not immediately known, the </span><span class="s3">Chinese commerce ministry</span><span class="s1"> said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> hiked interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"[The Fed rate hike] will have some direct or indirect impact on China's external trade and international investments. Further analysis is required to determine the extent," ministry spokesman Shen Danyang said at a regular press briefing held on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Stock Exchange gained 1.5 per cent in the morning trading session after Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen's widely-expected decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> set the daily yuan mid-price weaker for the ninth day running at 6.4757 against the US dollar before the yuan weakened further in the morning trading session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost everyone has been expecting the Fed to act and China's stock investors have been factoring this in for a long time as well," said Luo Yi, the chief analyst at Huatai Securities. "When it happened, it's quite natural to see China's stock prices rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's nothing to be feared. In the last rate hike cycle of the Fed, the Hong Kong stock market continued to boom - it's not necessarily right to say that a Fed rate hike will be a curse for emerging markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> entered its rate hike cycle in 2004, China was the world's No.6 economy, its financial market was largely closed to the outside world and Beijing could be fairly relaxed about the Fed's decisions. China has lost that luxury today, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the last Fed rate cycle, China was still in the back seat, watching the Fed move from afar and probably wondering how central banking works, but now China is in the forefront," said Sun Lijian, a finance professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. "It has to face possible results from any major move in the outside world - that's a new territory for China's policy makers."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun said China, now the world's second biggest economy, was much more exposed to global capital flow risks, despite its capital controls.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaignIt's not necessarily right to say that a Fed rate hike will be a curse for emerging marketsLuo Yi, financial analyst</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the Fed first mouthed the word "tapering" in 2013, it partly triggered a cash crunch in the onshore interbank with the overnight rate soaring to 13.4 per cent; then there was a stock market crash and yuan exchange rate turbulence - both linked to money flows and market expectations influenced by the Fed move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed in June cited financial market volatility in emerging markets and China's economic slowdown as reasons for not raising interest rates that month. Since then China has arrested people blamed for contributing to a stock market crash, allowed the yuan to fall to the lowest level in four years versus the dollar and announced again that the yuan will de-peg the dollar to follow a basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts at </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1"> led by Jiang Chao wrote in a research note that the Fed's rate decision marked "an official turning point of global liquidity" and would add to depreciation pressure on the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed's rate hike would "add pressure of capital outflow and yuan depreciation for China" and narrow the room for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to lower interest rates, they wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, China has to cut required reserve ratio to offset capital outflows. "We must deal with it from various fronts, first of all, we have to stabilise the domestic economy," the analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lending rates in Hong Kong have stayed unchanged since November 2008, when they were slashed to 5 per cent after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> trimmed rates to near zero in the wake of the global financial crisis. Before the crisis, the prime rate offered by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, in November 2007, was at 6.75 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Banks in Hong Kong have the leverage not to follow the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> on its interest rate policy. Of course, there is still the chance that liquidity may leave the banking system. But banks have the flexibility to hike rates in their own pace when that happens.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There was no sign on Thursday that there is any major liquidity outflow from the local banking system after the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> decision to lift its rate by 0.25 basis points.

The capital flow this year from mainland China has been strong and consistent this year as low economic growth and expectations of yuan depreciation across the border led more people to switch yuan savings into Hong Kong and US dollar-denominated assets.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks' access to wholesale funding from industry peers has also been robust. </span><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> reported the aggregate balance of interbank liquidity is at HK$391.3 billion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah says it is hard to predict how the Fed's decision to raise the US interest rate last week will affect Hong Kong, but the city's financial system is solid enough to overcome any volatile capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his weekly blog , Tsang says Hong Kong, which is vulnerable to overseas economic situations, should closely monitor whether asset prices are volatile and, if so, whether this will hurt appetite for shopping and investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US raised its interest rate a quarter percentage point last week, the first increase in a decade, sparking what Tsang described as "worries or concern" on the city's economic prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He cited that Hong Kong saw mixed reactions to three rounds of interest rate increases in 1994-1995; 1999-2000 and 2004-2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng benchmark index slipped in the six months after the rate rise in 1994-1995 but not the other round in 1999-2000, which means the city's economic health does not necessarily turn sour as a result, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This shows the reactions of higher interest rates to economic and financial markets are hard to predict," he said. "The US interest rate is only one factor affecting the global economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, Hong Kong faces the risk of capital outflow after an accumulated US$130 billion of capital poured in the city after the US and Europe launched quantitative easing programmes to soothe their economic wounds following the global financial crisis in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury, Ceajer Chan Ka-keung, warned yesterday that investors should be cautious about risk management and be prepared for any financial downturn as the city is enveloped in more uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In spite of the US interest rate rise, Europe central banks further relax their monetary policies, which causes more volatility to global financial markets, currency and capital flow," he said. "Together with the mainland's economic slump, the interest rate rise brings challenges to Hong Kong." But he and Tsang believed the city's solid financial system would be able to counter any outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, speaking at </span><span class="s3">RTHK</span><span class="s1">'s City Forum yesterday, Centaline Property Agency co-founder Shih Wing-ching said the interest rate rise should have little substantive impact on Hong Kong's property market for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Fed's current policy is relatively transparent. There are had been discussions of raising the interest rate for almost a year. already. So the market has already digested its impact," said Shih.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think the rise will have little substantive impact for now. But, psychologically, I can see investors becoming increasingly pessimistic about the market later."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah said on Friday he expects the Hong Kong dollar may weaken amid expectations of more capital outflow from the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency fell further on Friday morning to trade at 7.7854 against the US dollar at midday, weaker by 0.057 per cent from Thursday when it dropped to a four-year low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang told reporters before leaving on a trip to Beijing that the Hong Kong dollar might weaken further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is possible that the Hong Kong dollar may go to a weaker level to reach the weak end of the peg," he said. "This is because the US interest rate rise cycle has begun which would led to capital outflow from the Hong Kong market. This is natural the Hong Kong dollar would be weaker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since there was a lot of capital flow in the Hong Kong markets earlier, it is natural this money would leave the market at some stage. The government will closely monitor the market situation."Whenever the Hong Kong dollar reaches the weak end of 7.85, the HKMA will intervene to buy in Hong Kong dollar and to sell the US dollar to defend the pegNorman Chan Tak-lam</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US increased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in December in the first rate rise in a decade and analysts expect more rate rises this year, to about 1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar remains at the low end of the peg, which only allow the currency to trade between 7.75 to 7.85 before the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> intervenes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo, director of Tung Shing Futures, said the Hong Kong dollar's drop to a four-year low on Thursday was a result of capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Obviously, the international investors do not expect the stock market will bounce back much in future," he said. "They sold from the stock market and took the money out of Hong Kong to other markets. It is likely the currency will continue to be weak for the near future."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong dollar is also weaker against other major currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is 0.29 per cent weaker against the euro at 8.4722, dropped 0.56 per cent against the yen at 0.0662 and is weaker by 0.13 per cent against the onshore yuan at 1.1821.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam warned in December that the interest rate rise would lead the US$130 billion of hot money inflows to the city over the past few years to leave Hong Kong. The monetary easing policy in the US since 2008 has kept interest rates close to zero and led to multi-billion-dollar flows into Hong Kong that boosted the stock and property markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Whenever the Hong Kong dollar reaches the weak end of 7.85, the HKMA will intervene to buy in Hong Kong dollar and to sell the US dollar to defend the peg," Chan said. "The last time for the HKMA to defend the currency amid a fall to the weak end was 10 years ago."READ MORE: China Markets Live - Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks fall; Hong Kong dollar tumbles</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA had to intervene and defend the peg many times last year but that was to defend it from getting too strong as it kept trading at the strong end of 7.75, but the trend has now turned around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said the Hong Kong dollar was still trading at a normal range level and was not yet at the weak end of the peg linked system. Under the Hong Kong dollar peg, the HKMA will intervene whenever the Hong Kong dollar drops to the weak end of the peg at 7.85 or rise to the strong end at 7.75.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, executive director of brokerage firm SHK &amp; Co, said the falling stock market had revealed capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"From the performance of the stock market, there is obviously a capital outflow. The sentiment is not good and the outflow may well continue," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.36 per cent to 19,745 at 10am after dropping below 20,000 level on Monday for the first time since June 2013.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China intended to issue a digital currency as soon as possible, the central bank said yesterday, a move that could help the yuan offset the global dominance of the US dollar and limit capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> came as it wrapped up a symposium on digital currency in Beijing, where it discussed issuance frameworks and related technologies such as encryption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a statement summarising the forum and posted on its website, the bank said the currency could reduce the costs involved in circulating banknotes, facilitate economic activities and help combat money-laundering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A virtual currency would also help the bank improve control of the money supply and payment efficiency, it added</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking the step would thrust China into largely uncharted waters. Ecuador last year became the first nation to issue state-backed digital money. All of the banks in the tiny South American country have been told to get behind the push.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hao Hong, chief China strategist at the Bank of Communications, said China's attitude towards digital currency had been shifting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government came out sharply against Bitcoin in 2013, forbidding payment companies from accepting it. It later relented somewhat, and allowed Bitcoin exchanges, but banks must still give it wide berth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The attitude towards digital currency in China has been shifting, it has been surprising," Hong said. Back then it was quite hostile. Now, facing capital outflow pressure, a digital currency would make it easier to check the capital flow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-backed cryptocurrency would also allow the yuan to challenge the hegemony of the greenback, he said, but cautioned that would take time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US dollar has the luxury of pricing everything, every commodity, in US dollars. That is why it can maintain a power grip on the global economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PBOC chairman Zhou Xiaochuan, who attended the forum in Beijing, floated the idea of an alternative to the American dollar in 2009, saying it could be a "super-sovereign" currency based on the reserve asset of the International Monetary Funds. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> announced the renminbi would take its place alongside the US dollar, the yen, the British pound and the euro that comprise the special drawing rights basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But even with yuan's inclusion, China's efforts to dethrone the dollar in the existing international currency system have made very little progress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Ben Bernanke, the former US Fed chairman, told a forum in Hong Kong this week that Beijign's interest in creating an alternative to the greenback wouldn't work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a digital currency could gain traction at the domestic level. Payments for goods and services are increasingly becoming digital with new applications and online players jostling for a position in the potentially lucrative sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Weichao, the director of "mining" at Huobi.com, China's major platform for virtual currency trading, said a cryptocurrency might be popular with consumers. "</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It can be popular among the people - [if] it's endorsed by the government and convenient to use with new technologies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu Zhibing, the chief operating officer at Haoyouqian.com, a crowd-funding startup in Beijing, said digital money is "definitely the future".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China must seize the first-mover advantage to get on board - the central bank would be a sinner of the whole nation if other countries moved ahead while China lagged behind."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fan Yifei, a deputy central bank governor, attended the symposium as well. Experts from </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1"> and Deloitte were invited to attend the meeting as well.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing should not wait for the market to stabilise to launch the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect scheme and should introduce it as soon as possible to help attract more capital inflow to the mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chairman Chow Chung-kong said last Thursday, on the first trading day of the Year of the Monkey, that the long-awaited stock connect scheme between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets would definitely be launched but it would need to wait for the stock market to stabilise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the Hang Seng Index lost more than 700 points on Thursday in the biggest fall on the first trading day of a Lunar New Year since 1994, brokers interpreted his remarks as meaning the scheme would be launched in the second half of this year at the earliest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that would not be appropriate because any broker will tell you investors like to trade when the markets have big movements instead of in quiet markets. Even in a falling market, people like to buy when the share prices drop to more reasonable levels.It should be left to investors and not the regulators to decide when it is appropriate to enter the market</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As such, the mainland regulator should launch the new scheme whenever the platform and regulatory measures are ready and not when the market is stable. It should be left to investors and not the regulators to decide when it is appropriate to enter the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there's the capital flow issue. The depreciation of the yuan, which dropped more than 5 per cent against the US dollar last year and is expected to fall further this year, has led to many mainlanders rushing to buy US dollar or Hong Kong dollar investment products and life insurance policies to hedge their risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect would not worsen the situation because most mainland investors have accounts in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Investors who want to trade Hong Kong stocks could already have done so by trading via the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect would, however, open a new leg and new market for northbound trading - with international investors able to trade Shenzhen-listed companies in addition to Shanghai A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent survey by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> found international investors were interested in the Shenzhen stock markets because it is home to many potential high growth companies. Retail brokers in Hong Kong would also like to see Hong Kong investors allowed to trade Shenzhen stocks because it would boost their commission income.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That means the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect is likely to result in new capital inflow to mainland China from both international fund houses and Hong Kong retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, many fund managers believe that a precondition for A shares to be added to </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1">'s benchmark emerging markets index is giving them the ability to trade in the Shenzhen stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> said in June last year that its decision to defer the inclusion of A shares in its global emerging market benchmarks for a second year reflected lingering investor concerns over market accessibility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Beijing allows the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect to be launched soon, it would boost the chances of A shares being included in </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> indices. And that would lead to more exchange traded funds buying A shares, further boosting capital inflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is really no need to wait for the market to stabilise before launching the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves gained US$10 billion in March, in a sign of abating panic over the prospects of the world's second biggest economy and the outlook of its currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign exchange reserves rose to US$3.213 trillion at the end of last month from US$3.202 trillion at the end of February, data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> showed on Thursday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figure, which marked the first monthly rise since last October, was an improvement from previous months - the reserves fell US$28.6 billion in February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That compared with a record drop of US$108 billion in December and a similarly deep fall of US$99 billion in January.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The meeting will be attended by Kazuko Shiraishi, Japan's ambassador in charge of Arctic affairs, and her South Korean and Chinese counterparts Kim Chan Woo and Ma Xinmin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japan, South Korea and China are all observer states to the </span><span class="s3">Arctic Council</span><span class="s1"> and joined the organisation three years ago.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Routes have been opened up as parts of the ice pack melt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's Maritime Safety Administration released a 356-page guide this month offering detailed guidance on routes from the northern coast of North America to the northern Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Once this route is commonly used, it will directly change global maritime transport and have a profound influence on international trade, the world economy, capital flow and resource exploitation," said spokesman Liu Pengfei.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shorter shipping routes across the Arctic Ocean would save Chinese companies time and money. For example, the journey from Shanghai to Hamburg via the Arctic route is 2,800 nautical miles shorter than going by the Suez canal.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators may introduce Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) as a tool to accelerate the proposed London-Shanghai stock connect scheme, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Exchange officials from Britain and China have been busy since last September planning the connect scheme, which would enable investors on both sides to directly trade stocks listed on each others' market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But issues including the time difference, capital flow and settlement have proved tricky to solve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said on Tuesday it would consider introducing CDRs — stock trading certificates, similar to the US-traded ADRs — into the onshore market to allow “eligible foreign companies to issue shares in China”, as the country continues pushing for further opening up of its capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland financial media site Caixin quoted Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Security Regulatory Commission, as saying in Shanghai on Wednesday, that China will “fully support Chinese bourses' opening up and international cooperation” .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner at accounting firm EY, said: “The CDR could be one way of accelerating a London connect scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The critical Brexit referendum tomorrow may have an impact as to how quickly that could be implemented,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CDRs are essentially certificates issued by a Chinese bank representing a specified number of shares in a foreign stock, that are traded on a mainland exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are denominated in yuan, with the underlying security held by an offshore Chinese institution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Hao, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong, said CDRs could offer a closed-circuit capital flow for stock trading between Shanghai and London, or indeed other foreign bourses, similar to how the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect has been run for more than a year.They would help the Chinese authorities manage inflow and outflow volumes, while the yuan is still not fully convertibleHong Hao, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said they would help the Chinese authorities manage inflow and outflow volumes, while the yuan is still not fully convertible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the current Shanghai-Hong Kong scheme, fund flow has been restricted to closed channels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, mainland investor proceeds from selling Hong Kong shares are transferred back to their accounts in yuan, rather than being parking in Hong Kong, as Hong Kong dollars and used for other investment. Trading is also capped by daily and aggregate quotas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo Shiliang, an independent financial commentator based in Guangzhou, said China was likely to emphasise its commitment to opening up its capital account by introducing CDRs, “particularly at a crucial timing when the yuan is to formally join the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s elite Special Drawing Rights basket in October”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he did not think it currently possible, or any time soon, that China would allow foreign companies to issue new shares, “as the domestic stock market has yet to fully recover from last summer's rout and remains very sensitive to new offerings that may dilute liquidity”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pogson said one of the biggest challenges would be whether Chinas banks would be able to “redeem” the certificates in China in RMB.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, after a bank pays yuan in China to buy a CDR from an end customer, they would then have to sell the real shares overseas, leaving investors wondering whether they would be able to repatriate the foreign exchange proceeds back home.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Free Trade Zone has failed to live up to the lofty expectations that came with its launch three years ago, with the disappointing progress shedding light on the difficulties of managing the world's second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thursday marks the third anniversary of what was once a pet project for Premier Li Keqiang, a project that fuelled hopes for liberalising the nation's capital account, but any anniversary celebrations are likely to be low-key.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government's sluggish pace towards freedom of capital movement has largely been due to fear of losing control of capital flows, said Zhao Xijun, a professor of finance with Renmin University. He added that the outlook for any bolder moves looked bleak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014 Zhao was a member of a team from the university that was invited by the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> to assess progress of the Shanghai FTZ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The fear of losing hold of capital movement was behind the caution," Zhao said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the Shanghai Free Trade Zone was set up in 2013 it raised eyebrows because of its plan to introduce a pilot scheme to gradually remove capital controls as a step towards a freely convertible yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the pace of the yuan's internationalisation had gathered speed, with currency swap agreements with the </span><span class="s3">Bank of England</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1"> and the boosting of offshore yuan use in the Hong Kong market. In 2013 the yuan ranked as the world's eighth most transacted currency, up from 18th position in 2010, according to data from the Bank of International Settlement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's new free trade zones push inland but foreign investors still raise market access concerns[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2023337/chinas-new-free-trade-zones-push-inland-foreign-investors]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it was also a time when signs of fragility in China's economy and financial system began to surface, reverberating across markets as exports lost steam and an unprecedented credit crunch sent the benchmark annualised overnight repo rate soaring to a record high of 30 per cent. Investor nerves were also frayed after a "fat-finger error" in a bond transaction by </span><span class="s3">Everbright Securities</span><span class="s1"> triggered years of court trials and industry reflection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we lift restrictions on capital flow in the free trade zone, it equates to a complete loosening in the country, which would lead to unregulated capital movement and a big challenge for regulators to manage risks," Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After a surge of capital outflows late last year caused by large bets on a depreciating yuan, regulators tightened controls, a move directly in contrast with the express purpose of the Shanghai FTZ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The disappointing progress has also silenced calls for the zone to potentially participate in the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed high-level trade and investment pact for countries in the Pacific Rim, though China is not currently part of the pact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If financial capital could flow freely between the FTZ and other economies, and if there was full mobility between the FTZ and the rest of China, the FTZ would become a gateway for unfettered financial capital flow in and out of China's broader economy," said Louis Kuijs, a Hong Kong-based economist with Oxford Economics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That's not what the central government would want to see since it would heavily compromise its nationwide policy regime. That is why such financial flows between the FTZ and the rest of China were only allowed on a small scale - up to a quota," he said.The current extent of opening of the capital account and exchange rate regime is appropriate for China's economyZhao Xijun, Renmin University</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators saw some relief as outflows eased this year after last summer's stock meltdown triggered a surge of capital outflows. But regulator's have also slowed the pace of the yuan's internationalisation since it won a confidence vote last November to become the fifth currency in the basket of Special Drawing Rights of the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao said he doesn't think there will be rapid or major progress in the further opening up of financial markets.Strong central bank intervention to defend the yuan and speculative capital outflows have jointly reinforced a cautious attitude by the authority on managing the capital account, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The current extent of opening of the capital account and exchange rate regime is appropriate for China's economy," he said. "It is already the maximum that China's economy and macro-economic control can bear."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, China could expand the use of the SDR to reduce the world's reliance on the US dollar, rather than betting on bolder moves to liberalise the yuan and capital account in the short term, Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kuijs added, "I think where many people went wrong was in having unrealistic expectations as to how quickly China's central government would liberalise its nationwide policies on financial capital flows and how tolerant it would be with initiatives compromising nationwide policies."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is SDR?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Special drawing right, or SDR, is an international currency reserve to supplement </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> member countries' official reserves. It was created by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">) in 1969 to allow countries to purchase their domestic currencies in foreign exchange markets so that they could maintain exchange rates and encourage world trade. In 2009, SDR allocations helped increase liquidity and supplement member countries' official reserves as they dealt with the global financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Which currencies are in the SDR basket?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar, the euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling make up the SDR basket. It's been that way since 1999, when the euro replaced the German Deutsche mark and the French franc.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Who can use SDRs?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> members are allocated SDRs. Members can sell them to other member countries, but SDRs cannot be traded on private markets. When a country uses its SDR allocation, it is usually given the SDR equivalent value of one of the major currencies. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, South Korea mainly received US dollars, and more recently, Greece has been given mainly euro amid its debt crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How are SDR currencies and their weighted values determined?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The inclusion of the yuan in October doesn't mean it will always be in the SDR basket. Every five years, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> reevaluates the currencies in the SDR basket and their weighted values, based on the country's exports and a composite financial indicator. The decision to add the yuan to the basket was made after the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s November 2015 meeting, and both currencies and weightings won't be reexamined until the next </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> meeting in September 2021. Right now, the US dollar, euro, renminbi, yen, and pound sterling are weighted at 41.73 per cent, 30.93 per cent, 10.92 per cent, 8.33 per cent, and 8.09 per cent respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What was the last currency to be added to the basket?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The euro was the most recent addition to the basket, joining in January 1999 upon its creation, with an initial weighting of 32 per cent of one SDR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After its launch, the euro strengthened against the pound from 1.42 euros to a high of 1.7 euros in late 2000. Since then, it has weakened against the pound to 1.17 euros.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before the euro, the share of US dollars in foreign currency reserves was steadily rising, spiking from 59 per cent in 1995 to 71 per cent in 1999. The introduction of the euro reversed that trend, and the proportion of the European currency in foreign reserves has largely increased to make up a high of US$344.3 billion in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When did the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> decide to include China?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November last year, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the yuan satisfied the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s two main criteria for inclusion into the basket: that it is “widely used” and “freely usable”. In December 2015, the fund's executive board announced yuan would be included, making it the fifth currency in the basket and marking its growing use and trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What will the yuan's addition to the SDR basket mean for China?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say the inclusion is symbolically significant - but the actual impact on the currency and capital flow might not be dramatic. </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> says the inclusion is an acknowledgment of China's recent economic development, reform, and opening up to the world. </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> says it is a “seal of approval” of the currency and a commitment from China to “free use” of the renminbi - at least for </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> member central banks. </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> estimates the yuan's inclusion could bring between US$150 billion and US$200 billion in additional capital inflows to China over the next couple of years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong home prices are expected to rise 5 per cent next year, supported by the sustainability of sales volume recovery, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast to the forecast of 10 to 20 per cent price decline made early this year, analysts now expect the housing market will remain flat in 2016, and even begin moving higher in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Buyers have been piling back into the market over the last couple months amid mortgage rate promotions, a slower-than-expected rate hike cycle and developers' aggressive financing schemes on new launches, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year, we do not expect prices to fall,” said Thomas Lam, head of Valuation and Consultancy at international property consultant Knight Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam had predicted a 5 per cent decline in home prices in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's home prices plunged about 7 per cent in the first quarter in anticipation of looming interest rate tightening and a weakening economy. In the last five months prices have bounced back around 6 per cent, according to government data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment bank Macquarie predicts that home prices will go up 5 per cent next year, supported by the sustainability of volume recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Primary transaction volume is expected to increase by 15 per cent in 2017 and 10 per cent in 2018, Macquarie said in its report released on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Concerns about Brexit will also support “the continuous recovery of Hong Kong property”, Macquarie said, since capital flow will be diverted away from an uncertain Europe to “safer regions” such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Derek Chan, head of research at property agent Ricacorp Properties, said the city's market has bottomed out, proven by increase in prices and sales volume.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Land Registry said on Tuesday overall property deals in the city, including flats, shops and car parking spaces totalled 9,504 in September, a rise of 27.9 per cent month on month, and 73.8 per cent higher from a year earlier. Residential sales totalled 7,236 units, the highest since October 2012, according to propery agent Centaline.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Ricacorp's secondary homes survey, average prices of 50 major housing estates in September stood at HK$11,669 per square foot, 1.33 per cent higher than the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Home prices are now about 5 per cent below their peaks level in September 2015. Chan expects prices will retrace all the lost ground such that they recapture their former peak level sometime next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the risk of a US interest rate change and softening economy remain major risks for the Hong Kong property market. According to a survey by </span><span class="s3">CPA Australia</span><span class="s1">, the majority of Hong Kong business professionals are cautious about the city's economic prospects next year, amid pressures from other markets and political uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American economist David Doyle believes change in the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s interest rate target is increasingly likely to happen in December this year. This would flatten the yield curve over the next twelve to 24 months, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some analysts believe the recent gains are a temporary reprieve in a market that's likely to trend lower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nicole Wong, regional property research head at CLSA, forecasts an 8 per cent drop in prices in 2017, and an additional 5 per cent drop in of the two years following.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mizuho Securities Asia property analyst Alan Jin said an important indicator could be coming from property developers, many of whom are becoming “more bullish,” and feel more comfortable after years of skittishness related to the interest rate outlook.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In terms of next year's forecast, I don't know … it could go up a bit, but not substantially higher. It depends on how the volume plays out in the next couple of months,” Jin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday, Kerry Properties[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=683&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] beat out other bidders for a site in Kowloon Tong's Beacon Hill, by committing HK$7.268 billion, or HK$21,016 per sq ft, the highest unit rate for a government residential development site in Kowloon at auction.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, </span><span class="s3">Moody's Investors Service</span><span class="s1"> says a hot property market in Hong Kong will not be good for banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite a housing correction from last September to March 2016 where average housing prices fell 11 per cent, Moody's analyst Sherry Zhang said “most fundamental indicators still show property prices at historically high levels.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Affordability in terms of the price-to-income ratio is “already highly stretched,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Donald Trump may be a controversial figure, but the real estate mogul is more likely to improve things for Chinese investors buying up property in the United States than his rival Hillary Clinton, according to American real estate agents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A survey released on Monday by China's top international real estate website Juwai shows US real estate agents and China-based investors can't agree on which presidential candidate is more likely to put in place policies that help Chinese buying US property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US is the top destination for Chinese capital, with mainland Chinese spending US$5.1 billion in the first half of this year, a 21 per cent increase from the same period last year, according to Knight Frank research, so a reduction in investment could mean losing big bucks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey found 55 per cent of US real estate agents believed Trump would implement policies that benefit Chinese investors if he won the November 8 election, while a similar proportion of Chinese investors (54 per cent) said Clinton would be more likely to help mainland property buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over 50 per cent of real estate agents thought Chinese investment would increase under Trump, while 40 per cent thought it would decrease, the October survey of 504 Chinese investors and 416 real estate agents and professionals in the US found.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About a third of real estate agents thought Chinese investment would increase under Clinton, while a similar proportion (34 per cent) thought it would decrease.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither Clinton nor Trump have given any specific policies on international real estate investment, although real estate mogul Trump has international business ties through his luxury real estate company </span><span class="s3">Trump Organisation.Most</span><span class="s1"> Chinese observers feel that with him there are no ideologies, only interests, and interests can be negotiatedMatthew Moore, president, Juwai Americas</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump has previously made anti-China comments, describing Beijing as "using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China" and calling for a 45 per cent tariff on Chinese exports to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact that both Chinese investors and agents thought investment could significantly decrease under either candidate spoke to the dramatic nature of this year's campaign, said Juwai Americas president Matthew Moore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The vitriol of this election has created uncertainty in everyone's mind," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While Trump has made many anti-China statements, and promised to tax Chinese goods, most Chinese observers feel that with him there are no ideologies, only interests, and interests can be negotiated."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Simon Smith, head of research and consultancy for </span><span class="s3">Savills</span><span class="s1">, said he wasn't expecting either candidate to have a big impact on Chinese pouring money into the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think there is quite genuinely and correctly a high degree of uncertainty at the moment. Pre-election rhetoric on occasions with China ... can be quite misleading, and I think investors know that there are a lot of things said pre-election that may not materialise afterwards," Smith told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think we necessarily have a clear idea of what the post-election world will look like vis-a-vis Chinese investors," he said. "At this stage, it would be pure supposition to suggest one or the other would be better."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The significant amount of capital flow into the US ahead of the election suggested that there weren't serious concerns about the outcome of the election, Smith said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That suggests that alarm bells are not ringing for Chinese investors, that they anticipate some degree of continuity post-election."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The drivers behind the strong growth - mainland companies purchasing businesses and investors diversifying and escaping the weakening renminbi - were unlikely to change following the election, and instead investment was likely to grow, he said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Maybe there's a greater risk at home than overseas," he said, adding the Chinese government's moves to clamp down on capital flows could have a bigger impact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, JP Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) research found 18 per cent of Chinese investors thought the US presidential election would have an impact on their investment strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We think the impact of the US election on markets and the economy is likely to be more muted than the campaign hype might suggest," said Marcella Chow, global market strategist, JPMAM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Pew Survey of mainland Chinese released at the start of October found 37 per cent of respondents saw Hilary Clinton favourably, while 22 per cent saw Trump favourably.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll conducted last week shows the race between the two candidates narrowing, with voters split 47 per cent for Clinton and 45 per cent for Trump.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) is working flat out to attract more international firms, especially so-called new-economy companies, to list in the city to enhance the competitiveness of the local market, according to chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Over 60 per cent of listed companies on the Hong Kong stock market are mainland firms. Mainland investors clearly like to invest in our stocks but they would like to invest in more international stocks too, which are not available in the mainland," Li told a packed public forum on the soon-to-be launched Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect share trading link, on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we also want to attract more mainland investors into the Hong Kong stock market via the stock connect scheme between Hong Kong and Shanghai, we need to offer more international stocks for them to buy and attract more international firms or exchange traded funds to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched in November 2014 so international investors could buy A-shares in Shanghai via Hong Kong stock brokers, while mainlanders can invest in Hong Kong stocks via mainland brokers, under a daily quota.All we need now is the starting gun [for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect], but that's not in my handsCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After China's finance minister Lou Jiwei retired, many China economic policy watchers are again asking how long it will be until Zhou Xiaochuan, China's longest-serving central bank governor, steps down and who can replace him?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The answer matters for the Chinese economy and the world because Zhou and Lou are regarded as the cream of the pro-market Chinese technocrats who argued for China's transition from a command to a market-based economy, as well as for China's integration into the world economy. They have played important roles in drafting and implementing economically liberal measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The duo's belief in creating a properly functioning market system, without challenging the absolute power of the Communist Party, started to influence and shape China's economic policies as early as the 1990s. Partly due to their guidance, China's monetary and fiscal policies, at least on the surface, resemble those of the United States more than of the former Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lou's departure and Zhou's expected retirement, therefore, raise doubts as to whether Beijing has the willingness or capacity to deepen its market liberalisation. The absence of a group of "reformists" in the economic policymaking area could lead to ill-designed policies and a retreat to the old days of administrative control, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's finance minister Lou Jiwei steps down, former tax chief to take role[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2043588/chinas-finance-minister-lou-jiwei-steps-down-former-tax-chief]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese economic reform is going in reverse towards a more state-dominated model," said Christopher Balding, an associate professor with the Peking University HSBC Business School in Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Unfortunately, the recent personnel movements seem to confirm this shift," he added. "It does appear as if people that might be more economically reform minded are being moved away from key positions, indicating a deeper foundation for a more state-centred focus on economic policy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The appointment of a new finance minister was announced earlier this month by the country's legislature when Lou was accompanying Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on a foreign visit. The new minister, Xiao Jie, worked previously as China's tax administration chief and there were few records of his views apart from a 2010 article saying China has room to raise taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese media outlet Caixin online said on Thursday that Lou had become the fifth chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund. The appointment was not unexpected as three of the four former (NSSF) chairmen were retired financial ministers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gossip about Zhou leaving has been circulating for years. Reuters and Bloomberg reported Zhou's departure years ago, although both were later proved wrong, and the Wall Street Journal in September 2014 reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping was considering removing Zhou, but that also didn't happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's central bank chief says his job is too difficult for many people to understand[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1981129/chinas-central-bank-chief-says-his-job-too-difficult-many-people]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it's clear that Zhou, at 68, is getting close to retirement. The unusual extension of his tenure was deemed to be because of the lack of a strong successor, and a reflection of the difficulties in pressing ahead with market-oriented reforms to reshape the pattern of economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Zhou has achieved much in the past 14 years, including revitalising China's state banking system, creating a huge onshore bond market, freeing up interest rate controls and making the yuan a nominal international reserve currency, there is still plenty to be done by his successors, including opening up the capital account to make the Chinese currency a truly convertible currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, after seeing massive capital outflow since late last year, the Chinese authorities have been tightening restrictions on capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The pace of the yuan's reform could have moved faster," said Chen Long, an economist with Gavekal Dragonomics. "The authority missed the chance to tolerate more flexible movement of the yuan in 2013 and 2014. But we still have hope to realise a free float in the coming two years."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has been a guessing game for a while as to who will succeed Zhou as the new central bank governor. The favourites so far include PBOC deputy governor Yi Gang, China Securities Regulatory Commission chairman Liu Shiyu and Bank of China chairman Tian Guoli.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese central bank chief calls for concerted effort towards global recovery[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1936764/chinese-central-bank-chief-calls-concerted-effort-towards-global]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I am confident the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will retain a reform-driven mindset, but the pace of reform may slow due to increasing uncertainties and risks globally and increasing tension and challenges facing Chinese economic growth and financial stability," said Zhu Ning, a finance professor at Tsinghua University.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, who headed the management of the foreign exchange reserves for seven years, is also a vice-director with the central economic and financial working group, an economic advisory body reporting directly to Xi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CSRC's Liu replaced Xiao Gang after a disastrous response to stock turmoil earlier this year, and quelled the market while favouring stability over reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [financial] reform does not depend on one personality," said Tim Condon, head of Asian financial market research at ING. "It comes from the top. Whoever takes over the central bank, he will manage to stay the course laid out by Zhou without too much interruption."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has ordered the country's banks to stop issuing credit cards that allow customers to transact purchases in dual currencies, in the latest move to plug regulatory gaps and stem capital flight while the renminbi continues to sink to an eight-year low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Credit cards issued in China with </span><span class="s3">Visa</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> must be replaced with those issued by the country's dominant currency clearing company </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay Co</span><span class="s1"> when they expire, according to a November 23 report in the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper, citing a recent undated meeting called by the central bank with Chinese lenders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Existing cards that offer dual-currency services can continue until their expiry, the newspaper said. Under new regulations, credit cards can be issued for either yuan-denominated transactions, or enabled for purchases in hard currency, carrying UnionPay's logo. </span><span class="s3">Visa</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> must apply separately to commence credit card businesses in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These moves appear to be part of the continuing clamp down on capital outflows,” said Keith Pogson, a partner in EY's financial services practice in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual currency services have been a feature among the credit cards issued by the </span><span class="s3">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">, Bank of Communications, </span><span class="s3">Pudong Development Bank</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1"> and scores of other mainland-based lenders for at least 14 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The service enable Chinese consumers to shop overseas, using the worldwide network and currency clearing services operated by </span><span class="s3">Visa</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1">, while UnionPay nurses its nascent service within mainland China. As UnionPay grows in size, and expands outside China's shores to make the renminbi accessible and usable, the second logo on the credit card becomes expendable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change has become more urgent this year, as the renminbi has weakened by more than 6 per cent against the US Dollar to the lowest in eight years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As much as US$728 billion worth of capital has left China so far this year, according to the French bank </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1">' Capital Flow Tracker data, with US$246 billion in outflows in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third quarter also saw a large increase in the amount of yuan-denominated outflows, which made 36 per cent of the total outflows in September, according to </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To stem the prospect of a capital flight, China's currency regulator and the central bank took action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, the currency regulator, imposed a ban on UnionPay's use for buying insurance and “investment-related products” in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The authorities are just moving through, looking for all different loopholes that allow individuals to transfer large sums of money overseas,” said Pogson.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's credit card market is currently going through a period of transition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> published rules in June to allow foreign payment card companies to operate on the mainland. Mastercard's president of international markets Ann Cairns told Reuters in July that the company was hoping to enter China as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese bank card transactions reached 55 trillion yuan (US$7.9 trillion) last year, according to the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest rule gives the home-grown UnionPay a leg up, as it prepares for competition with the foreign brands before they commence service in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The idea is to get rid of dual-brand cards before </span><span class="s3">Visa</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> launch their independent operations,” said Denis Suslov, an analyst at Shanghai-based financial industry consultancy Kapronasia. “These new regulations help UnionPay better position itself before the market opens to foreign competition.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesperson for Visa declined to comment to inquiries from the South China Morning Post about the new regulations while </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities are stepping up their monitoring of yuan outflow, in addition to tightening up scrutiny of overseas investments, in an attempt to curb the sharp depreciation of the currency since October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net outbound yuan payments have totaled 1.8 trillion in the year to date, while offshore yuan deposits declined by 255.7 billion yuan, according to new data compiled by Wind Information and </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (CICC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This suggests RMB outflows may have become a way for Chinese companies to circumvent foreign exchange (FX) controls, by moving capital across borders, and converting it into foreign exchange denominated assets offshore,” the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Offshore RMB lending to finance Chinese companies' overseas investment has become a key channel for RMB outflows, as have dividend payments and profit repatriation,” the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Different levels of restriction over RMB and foreign exchange capital activities may have attracted regulatory arbitrage, and resulted in an the acceleration of RMB outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China may well incorporate RMB outflows into a unified macro-prudential regulatory framework for cross-border capital flow [in future] if the currency pressure heightens,” it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some commercial banks have already been receiving guidance from the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, the central bank, on how to tighten their capital account controls, particularly when dealing with items involving overseas direct investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past, any outflow below one billion yuan could be settled before reporting to the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE). But starting today, all outflow above 500 million yuan needs the signature of a local bank deputy governor,” one banker with a Shanghai based state-owned commercial bank told the Post, asking not to be named.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign investment ‘shopping spree' over as Beijing moves to slash capital outflow[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2050029/chinas-foreign-investment-shopping-spree-over-beijing-moves-slash]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The order we received is to strictly verify the source of capital and the purpose for overseas usage, to make sure the outflow is reasonable, and in accordance with rules and law,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has fallen over 6 per cent against the US dollar this year, dropping around 2 per cent since the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the US election, leaving it at an eight and a half year low against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign currency reserves have fallen to their lowest since March 2011 to US$ 3.12 trillion by the end of October, with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> widely believed to have sold US dollars to cushion the currency's decline.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a bid to prevent continued sharp falls in the yuan, while at the same time halting the ongoing drain of the country's foreign exchange reserves, the government has enacted a string of measures, mainly blocking the outflow channels, including banning Chinese customers from buying overseas insurance products other than accident and medical-related policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported on Friday that China planed to tighten controls on companies looking to invest abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Targeted for particular scrutiny by the pending measures are “extra-large” foreign acquisitions valued at US$10 billion or more per deal, property investments by state-owned firms above US$1 billion and investments of US$1 billion or more by any Chinese company in an overseas entity unrelated to the investor's core business.The depreciation pressure on the yuan should ease as outflows taper, but that may only work temporarilyAdian Yao, senior emerging Asia economist, AXA Investment</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a statement from </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1">, four national authorities - the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC), the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, and SAFE - have made a joint that China is still promoting healthy outbound investment, but “will verify some overseas investment projects”, according to rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adian Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment, said: “The tightening is meant to curb overseas investment using high leverage, or targets that are unrelated to the acquirer's core business, or those that are disguised capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The depreciation pressure on the yuan should ease as outflows taper, but that may only work temporarily,” he said, adding in the short term, the movement of yuan is still largely dependent on the US dollar's momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's investment in private sector organisations remains low, at 27.7 per cent of GDP as of June, compared with 133.8 per cent of GDP for the US, and 161 per cent of GDP for Japan, according to the CICC note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rise of Chinese overseas investment is a long-term trend, but it should be a gradual process,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It takes time for Chinese companies to learn and adapt to local cultures, ethical practises, regulatory standards... Leveraged deals that are not motivated by real investment opportunities but intrinsically one-way bets against the RMB may have to pay high “learning costs” when things turn unfavourable.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cross-border Stock Connect trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai has led to increased fund flow between the two stock markets - but it has yet to narrow the price gap between the shares listed on either bourse, illustrating just few investors have profited by trading in both.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And brokers believe the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which goes live on from Monday December 5, is unlikely to make any difference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While stocks such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> - dual listed in Hong Kong and London - have seen their prices perform similarly in the two markets, A-shares [shares in mainland China-listed companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen] in general are trading at a premium of about 23.18 per cent to H-shares [shares in Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange], according to the Hang Seng China AH Premium Index which tracks the price gap between the two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A reading of 100 would mean no price gap, but the index stood at 123.18 per cent on Friday, November 25, compared with 148.84 in January 21. The gap remains, but at least it's narrowing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the most extreme case, </span><span class="s3">Luoyang Glass</span><span class="s1"> H-shares traded at HK$5.56 in Hong Kong on Tuesday, while its A-shares traded in Shanghai at 25.61 yuan, represent A to H shares premium stood at 417.45 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even with the Stock Connect in place, few investors sell expensive A-shares to buy cheaper H-shares, and pocket the difference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One reason for this could be that cross-border turnover is still much lower than the domestic pool of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International investors trading in A-shares still only represent between 1 and 2 per cent of the Shanghai total turnover, while mainland investor trading represents 5 to 10 per cent of Hong Kong's turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage, said the views of Hong Kong and mainland investors vary on certain stocks, which adds risk if any try to take profit from arbitrage by trading in the two markets.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mainland investors tend to like to invest in stocks that might benefit from government policies while foreign investors put more emphasis on fundamentals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a mainland investor sells Luoyang Glass A-share in Shanghai and buy its H-shares in Hong Kong, they look cheap.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese investors lukewarm on Shenzhen-Hong Kong connect, say brokers[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2051149/mainland-chinese-investors-lukewarm-shenzhen-hong]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, if a foreign investor sells H-shares to buy a popular mainland stocks to generate profit they are likely to get their fingers burnt,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currency is another key issue in the mix, Tse said, as A-shares are priced in yuan and H-shares in Hong Kong dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some mainlanders have been buying H-shares via the Stock Connect as they are worried about the devaluation of the yuan. But these investors are not doing arbitrage, they are only trying to hedge against the falling currency,” Tse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Henry Chan, chief investment officer at BEA Union Investment Management, thinks the persistent price differential between A- and H-shares is explained by the divergence in investor preferences and considerations between the markets.Some mainlanders have been buying H-shares via the Stock Connect as they are worried about the devaluation of the yuan. But these investors are not doing arbitrage, they are only trying to hedge against the falling currencyLouis Tse Ming-kwong, director, VC Brokerage</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The fact that it is the same underlying company does not mean the two listings will always trade at the same price. Look outside of the A-H space, and we see continued price divergences in dual listings such as BHP, </span><span class="s3">Rio Tinto</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Brambles</span><span class="s1">, all of which are listed on both the Australian and UK stock markets,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Wong, Asia equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, said there are no arbitrage opportunities between Hong Kong and Shanghai because the two markets' shares are not fungible, and can't be bought and sold in each other's respective markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We don't believe that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect will play a big difference on the valuation gap, especially given that Shenzhen stocks tend to trade at even higher multiples.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen stock market now trades at an average price-earnings ratio of 44.59, compared with Shanghai stock market's 16.49 times and Hong Kong is 10.79.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Timothy Lo, a managing director at French private bank CIC Investor Services, said A-shares were trading at a premium to H-shares, even before the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was introduced two years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Bear in mind, all Hong Kong and overseas investors are allowed to trade eligible shares listed in Shanghai, while only mainland institutional investors and individual investors who have 500,000 yuan in their brokerage account are eligible to trade in Hong Kong.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hence there are some retail investors who cannot meet this criteria, and are left with no alternative but to invest in A-shares, which of course are trading at a premium, relative to H-shares,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The difficulties in borrowing capital to buy A-shares, and naked shorting [short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist] in the A-share market is prohibited, makes it less likely to have arbitrage activities between the two markets.”The Hong Kong market is a mixture of global and local Hong Kong money, often more focused on value and global market issues such as the overall sentiment towards ChinaKeith Pogson, senior partner, EY</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner at EY, said although the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets are connected, there is little arbitrage as the two markets are actually very different.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong market is a mixture of global and local Hong Kong money, often more focused on value and global market issues such as the overall sentiment towards China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The mainland domestic markets are often much more susceptible to short-term movements around specific stocks and closer to rumours about macro-economic policy changes and stimulus initiatives by the central government and others in Beijing and across the country,” Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These drive fundamentally different assessments of value. Without the ability to physically deliver one of the stocks into the other market, it is unlikely that the premium and discount gap will actually be arbitraged anytime soon,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International, said since A- and H-shares are not fungible and are traded in different currencies, the arbitrage play exists “only in a dangerous game of borrowing shares in one market and currency, and buying them in another with the same variables and trying to get the variables to not eat into one's profit.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not very easy to set up a traditional arbitrage situation [a combination of both value and growth investing] and one runs the risk of a host of things going wrong or costing too much,” McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, the chairman of Morton Securities, said the A- and H-share price gap will continue to exist until the mainland's capital flow and other investment restrictions are loosened to levels similar to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect is aimed at moving in that direction, but I expect the gap will remain in the foreseeable future,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of AIA Group, said as China's market liberalisation continues, investors can expect the valuations between A- and H-shares to narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Further deepening of the capital markets, including the introduction of derivatives and hedging instruments over time, will support convergence between A- and H-shares.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> will limit the amount of yuan that mainland companies can remit outside the country, imposing a cap for the first time in more than two decades to stem money outflows amid the currency's 7 per cent decline this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, December 2</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On my first trip across the border in 1979, China had a dual currency system. There was yuan, which no foreigner could officially buy. There were also foreign exchange certificates (FEC), officially valued at one yuan each. Foreigners could use these at Friendship Stores that scorned yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a whim I offered a street peddler 50 FEC for some trinket she priced at two yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Did her eyes light up? Did they just. A nanosecond later I was holding 48 yuan of worn-out greasy grey paper in change and the 50 FEC had vanished to be replaced by a great grin across her face. Winner! Her street stall neighbours, who had seen it all, grimaced in envy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing had not told its own people about FEC, but the whole street in Guangzhou knew and there was instant recognition of my 50 FEC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And there you have the definition of funny money. The more restrictions you impose on your people to stop them from exchanging your country's currency for another, the funnier your currency becomes and the more that your people want out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing obviously does not like to see the yuan considered funny money and has gone to great lengths to erase this stain, gradually easing restrictions in recent years on cross-border investment flows. The crowning achievement was the recent inclusion of the yuan in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s basket of Special Drawing Rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And now things are going the other way again. The restrictions are being tightened as more people want out and the yuan's exchange rate has slid. The spectre of funny money looms once more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But let's set some things straight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is actually no outflow of yuan. If anything there is an inflow. Yuan deposits in Hong Kong, for instance, have plummeted by more than 300 billion yuan over the last year, all of it money gone back across the border. Mainland bank demand deposits in yuan are growing at almost 30 per cent year over year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreigners also do not want to hold yuan. Why should they? There is nothing they can buy with it in their own countries and the only reason they ever held any is that they were speculating on a strong yuan. Now it's weak. Even mainland exporters would rather be paid in US dollars just now, not yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's counter-intuitive, but it's fact. Ask any economist. In the balance of payments there is actually no such thing as cross-border capital flow. There is only the preference of holding one currency over another and this is what moves the exchange rate. I know it sounds all wrong. But it's true.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When we talk of mainland capital flight, what we actually mean is exporters keeping the foreign currency proceeds of their exports abroad rather than using the money to buy import goods. We also mean the central bank running down its foreign currency reserves in exchange for local currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Add those two together and you get a balance of payments negative position running at about US$700 billion a year at present, which is an enormous figure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is what is pushing the yuan down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The simple fact is that, increasingly, more people are worried about the sustainability of the mainland economy's growth and they want out. The more they are restrained from moving out, the more desperate they become and the funnier the money becomes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is an easy way to stop it. Let the yuan drop to its natural level. This may be way down, but magic will result. The economy will bounce back. Every test of this remedy says so.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall in China's foreign ­exchange reserves accelerated in November even though Beijing is gradually closing the door on ­capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The larger-than-expected decline in the world's biggest stockpile of foreign exchange exposed the flaws in Beijing's current ­approach of selling state reserves to support the yuan and was very likely to force the authorities to take a stricter line on outbound investment and payments, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves shrank by US$69.1 billion last month to US$3.052 trillion, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Wednesday. The mainland has lost nearly US$1 trillion worth of reserves since the figure peaked in June 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">November's drop, the largest monthly fall since January, came as the US dollar index hit a 13-year high following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential ­election.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tim Condon, chief Asia economist at ING in Singapore, said the rapid fall was undermining the Chinese government's plan of a gradual and orderly decline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/12/07/c972e6c4-bc8c-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_image_hires.jpg]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The authorities will respond by tightening capital controls and stabilising the daily midpoint, which they have done in past episodes of market turbulence,” Condon said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a joint statement released on Tuesday, the central bank and the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1">, the state's economic planning agency, warned of “irrational investment” in foreign properties, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and soccer clubs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Documents obtained earlier by the South China Morning Post show capital outflow controls are already in force involving forex clearance for outbound investment of more than US$5 million, plus stricter reviews in place over very large deals. Both outbound investment and these mega deals are set to limit the speed and size of capital flow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The recent control measures are pre-emptive to prevent capital outflow pressure from rising on the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s highly likely interest rate rise in December,” said Zhu Qibing, chief macro analyst at mainland brokerage </span><span class="s3">CITIC Securities International</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall in the value of the yuan, the reduction in foreign exchange reserves and the government measures to control outbound investment have all come at once.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's efforts to calm market concerns about the yuan's value, or breaking the one-way bet on the yuan's depreciation, have so far achieved only limited success, if any at all.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is about to turn its guns back on the gaming industry in its battle against the multi-billion-yuan outflow of capital from its economy as Macau prepares to slash in half the amount of cash </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> bank card holders can withdraw from ATM machines in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move to cut the daily withdrawal limit from 10,000 to 5,000 patacas is expected to take effect from Saturday and follows the discovery that as much as 10 billion patacas in </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> ATM withdrawals were made in one month alone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also comes amid so far unanswered claims that the customer voucher scheme run by Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore - which apparently allows </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> card users to buy gaming chips in breach of China's strict currency controls - has seen billions of yuan flow out of the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Monetary Authority of Macau's ATM withdrawal cut is understood to be a reaction to attempts by illicit money movers to circumvent Beijing's move at the beginning of this year to cap at 100,000 yuan (HK$112,600) the annual amount that UnionPay card holders could withdraw.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two years ago, Beijing put the squeeze on the multi-billion yuan flow of illicit cash through Macau by imposing a crackdown on the use of UnionPay point of service machines, which were being used to disguise overseas transactions as local mainland ones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also cracked down on the practice of pawnshops paying cash for products such as jewellery and watches bought with UnionPay cards to subvert currency controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pressure appears to have had a possible knock-on effect in other casino jurisdictions like Singapore.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest moves follow a fall in China's foreign ­exchange reserves in November despite Beijing's attempts to close the door on ­capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The larger-than-expected decline in the world's biggest stockpile of foreign exchange exposed the flaws in Beijing's current ­approach of selling state reserves to support the yuan and was likely to force the authorities to take a stricter line on outbound investment and payments, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves shrank by US$69.1 billion last month to US$3.052 trillion, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Documents obtained earlier by the Post show capital outflow controls are already in force involving forex clearance for outbound investment of more than US$5 million, plus stricter reviews in place over very large deals.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has described the country's measures for limiting the yuan's outflows as a temporary means for preventing capital flight and restoring calm to the currency markets, said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's chief executive Norman Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Governor Zhou said the measures are for the short term,” Chan said in Beijing, after leading a visit by the Hong Kong Association of Bankers to the Chinese central bank. “When the market condition becomes stable, the capital flow will be back to normal.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> imposed a limit on companies that wanted to remit the yuan, equivalent to 30 per cent of their shareholders' equity two weekend ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to the cap, non-financial firms are only allowed to execute any transfers as loans to offshore entities, and these must be supported by valid commercial reasons and must be repaid as per schedule, according to the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the new rule took effect, mainland banks had been discouraging customers from any cross-border transactions in their capital accounts, including for overseas debt repayments, despite having set up intra-group yuan cash pools on both sides of the border with China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move follows the yuan's deterioration against the US dollar by as much as 7 per cent this year, as the greenback surged against global currencies on expectations that interest rates would rise back home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result of the yuan's weakening, many Chinese companies and ordinary citizens had been devising schemes to take their currency out of the country before it deteriorates further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those measures may be subjected to adjustments once the currency markets are stabilised, Chan said Monday, after his meeting with Zhou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's three-day trip to Beijing included visits to the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank</span><span class="s1">, as well as with Chinese vice premier Ma Kai, who formerly headed the National Development &amp; Reform Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By using administrative measures to control the currency, the Chinese monetary authority is exercising greater flexibility “to highlight that the overall direction of China's financial reforms remain market-oriented, and remain unchanged,” said ANZ Bank's China economist Qu Tianshi. These are just measures “put in place to stem the capital outflows,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“To a great extent the controls will depend on market conditions, until the depreciation pressure eases on the yuan and the capital outflow subsides,” Qu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan strengthened on Monday for the first day in four, rising to 6.9472 per dollar, after tumbling last week when the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised interest rates and officially ended almost a decade of easy finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the shrink in renminbi liquidity pool is as a result of investors' adjustment in asset allocation amid the depreciation, but it will have little impact on Hong Kong's banking sector and the internationalisation of the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An imbalance in demand for offshore renminbi is normal,” Chan said. “Although it will cause volatility in the exchange rate, this is also with the market's expectation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">May Tan, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, said the shrinking renminbi liquidity pool will have little impact on the banking sector as banks are still conducting businesses in other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan, who is also chief executive at Standard Chartered for Hong Kong, said China is still committed to the internationalisation of renminbi despite those temporary measures to stem outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the Chinese yuan keeps weakening against the dollar, a question is becoming acute for Beijing: should China let the market take its course and permit a deep currency fall or should it keep burning its foreign exchange reserves to support the currency's value?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The debate over what Beijing should do about its currency is heating up as regulators' ambiguity over the question is becoming costly and unsustainable, particularly since the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's currency curbs merely ‘temporary' to stem yuan's outflow, central bank chief says[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/article/2055798/chinas-currency-curbs-merely-temporary-stem-yuans-outflow-central]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against Beijing's desire for a "controllable" depreciation, the government is losing control over capital flight, depleting foreign exchange reserve stockpile at an alarming speed, and failing to convince investors that there is "no fundamental basis for the continuous depreciation".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu Yongding, a renowned Chinese economist who sat on the central bank's monetary policy committee when the yuan was revalued in July 2005, said it was time for Beijing to reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/12/20/a6d29e5e-c680-11e6-b0e3-e12c29c152ce_image_hires.JPG]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The fear of the yuan's depreciation has become a burden for us," Yu told a forum over the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu, who for years has called for liberalising the yuan's exchange rate over years, said China should give up foreign exchange interventions and safeguard its foreign exchange reserves so that China will "have sufficient ammunition" for future rainy days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Yu's view is not in line with Beijing's current policy, it is winning academic support.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu Sitao, the China chief economist at Deloitte, an auditing firm, said "the best strategy is to let the yuan fall in full, and the worst strategy is slowly depleting foreign exchange reserves".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves have shranked by nearly US$1 trillion since its peak in 2014, and there's no sign that the haemorrhage will stop in near future. To curb outflows, China has imposed capital account controls, restricting outbound investment and payment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu said the administrative measures over capital outflows "will probably generate more negative impact" on the yuan as such measures hurt China's overall openness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The monetary authority is walking a fine line - the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">is tolerating a weakening yuan against the dollar as long as it does not fall too quickly. Meanwhile, Beijing is now hoping that the wind will blow in its favour again.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dollar index to gauge the strength of the greenback against six major currencies has remained above 100 points. It could reach 120 in the coming two years, further squeezing Beijing's leeway to manage the yuan, said Jin Baisong, a researcher at the Ministry of Commerce.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu Ning has joined a small but growing group of economists in Beijing who believe the central bank should change its tactics with regard to the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Zhu, deputy director of the university's National Institute of Financial Research, said the current approach adopted by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> - namely using up foreign exchange reserves to prevent the yuan from falling sharply - was unsustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The yuan has lost more than 10 per cent [against the dollar] from its peak, but China's foreign exchange reserves have lost almost 25 per cent," Zhu said. "What can China do if the reserves keep shrinking ... if its reserves can't meet current account payment requirements?"</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu said a more feasible approach was to let the yuan fall as much as the marketpermitted.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu, whose book provides a systemic analysis of the country's financial risks stemming from an implicit government guarantee of the banking system, state enterprises and local government debts, is the latest big-name economist to question Beijing's ongoing exchange rate policy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the longer term, the Chinese currency weakened 7 per cent against the US dollar last year - the largest decline since it reversed a 10-year appreciation in 2014, despite the fact that Beijing had used nearly 1 trillion dollars of foreign exchange reserves to bolster the currency since 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should stop its heavy intervention in the yuan exchange rate and allow a one-off devaluation of the yuan, according to the finance professor at the prestigious </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1"> and author of China's Guaranteed Bubble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu Ning has joined a small but growing group of economists in Beijing who believe the central bank should change its tactics with regard to the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Zhu, deputy director of the university's National Institute of Financial Research, said the current approach adopted by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> - namely using up foreign exchange reserves to prevent the yuan from falling sharply - was unsustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan has lost more than 10 per cent [against the dollar] from its peak, but China's foreign exchange reserves have lost almost 25 per cent,” Zhu said. “What can China do if the reserves keep shrinking ... if its reserves can't meet current account payment requirements?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China backflips on currency policy with controls to stem yuan's outflow[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2050744/chinas-central-bank-caps-yuans-outflow-stem-currencys-slump]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu said a more feasible approach was to let the yuan fall as much as the marketpermitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There may be overshooting, but the market will gradually correct itself,” Zhu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By letting market forces determine the exchange rate, China “can avoid the loss of forex reserves and send a signal that it is a market-oriented operation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu, whose book provides a systemic analysis of the country's financial risks stemming from an implicit government guarantee of the banking system, state enterprises and local government debts, is the latest big-name economist to question Beijing's ongoing exchange rate policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He joined Yu Yongding, a former monetary policy committee member, who has argued for years that the central bank should stop intervening in the foreign exchange market.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu Baoliang, a government researcher at the State Information Centre, a think-tank affiliated with China's economic planing agency, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying on Tuesday that China should allow a big yuan revaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be fair, their views are more academic arguments, and it is not known whether their comments will be accepted by China's policymakers and lead to a change in stance over the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">, meanwhile, is showing a reluctance to permit any dramatic fall in the value of the yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the age of 34, Ding Wen had built up a personal fortune of more than two million yuan after years of hard work at an internet company in Nanjing, in east China's Jiangsu province.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he saw most of that wealth go up in smoke on January 5, when China's bitcoin market crashed, sending the price of the virtual currency plunging 40 per cent in just a few hours after lunch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the market in free fall, Ding was unable to log into his account with China's biggest bitcoin trading platform, Huobi, meaning he could not sell off his holdings or top up his principal to meet the margin call.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the time he managed to log on in the evening, most of the bitcoins in his account had been compulsorily sold off by Huobi for 6,361 yuan each, lower than his purchase price of 8,101 yuan. This included the part of his investment he had bought using a loan he obtained from Huobi by pledging the bitcoins he owned originally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/01/13/3c553fbc-d992-11e6-bbb7-6a43a6f882fe_image_hires.jpg]“I have taken on big risks when making leveraged betting, but the collapse of the trading system made me unable to run stop-loss orders, so I think the platform should compensate for investors' losses,” Ding said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ahead of the market crash, Ding had borrowed 995 million yuan from Huobi by pledging a principal consisting of the 409 bitcoins he already owned. He then bought a further 1,228 bitcoins with the loan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of his holdings were compulsorily sold out by Huobi during the price collapse while he was unable to access his account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu Xing, head of marketing at Huobi, said the log-in delay was caused by a torrent of visits and selling orders, which exceeded the capacity of the website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[The loss] was due to irresistible factors and not included in the compensation scope. We are sorry and understand the feelings of the investors,” she said.In theory, the bitcoin market is borderless, and as long as you could find a buyer overseas, you would be able to get US dollars, and the trade could happen without leaving a traceCheung Chun-yin, PwC China fintech partner</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analysts and investors fear China's bitcoin market is quickly turning into another time bomb like the scandal-hit peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sector. A series of P2P lending platform frauds rocked the country last year and washed away tens of billions of yuan of investment from small investors, creating a headache for local and central governments, which feared social unrest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now speculation, derivative products, leveraged betting and program trading appear to be spreading in the largely unregulated bitcoin market. Such practices are thought to be responsible for pushing up the price of bitcoin by more than 260 per cent since early 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market hit a historic high of 8,995 yuan on January 5, just ahead of the crash.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/01/13/3cd614e8-d992-11e6-bbb7-6a43a6f882fe_image_hires.jpg]Most of the transactions are happening on three privately owned platforms or through P2P trading.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data provider Bitcoinity shows trading volume in China accounted for more than 98 per cent of the global total during the past 30 days amid more pronounced price fluctuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Until now, no regulator has overseen this market, which sees daily turnover worth tens of billions of yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, things appear to be changing fast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the great bitcoin crash, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> announced on Wednesday afternoon that it had sent inspection teams to the country's top three bitcoin trading platforms to scrutinise their practices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the first regulatory move </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has made publicly involving the virtual currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has been in talks with the platforms from time to time in private since 2013 and asked them for data and information, according to an executive from a major trading platform, who asked not to be named.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the authorities have not formally listed bitcoin under their regulatory framework. Nor have they issued any rules to govern the market.The bitcoin market is facing great risks, with turnover and leverage climbing quicklyChen Yunfeng, senior partner, Zhonglun W and D</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like all other central banks, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> defines bitcoin as a commodity rather than a currency, which ruled it out of their existing regulatory coverage in late 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aurélien Menant, founder and chief executive of Gatecoin, a cryptocurrency and blockchain assets trading platform based in Hong Kong, said: “Given the dominant role of Chinese exchanges, which represent 95 per cent of global bitcoin trading activity, at more than 50 billion yuan every day, it's likely that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> recognises the growing significance of this new and so far unregulated alternative financial market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has been engaging with the major cryptocurrency exchanges in China for several years, but given the sudden price movements and high volumes traded over the past few weeks, it's very clear that now it just wanted to step up their checks on market manipulation and money laundering.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an announcement issued on Wednesday, the central bank said it was joining forces with the Beijing Financial Bureau to probe trading platforms including Huobi and OKCoin to check if they were running in accordance with foreign-exchange management, anti-money-laundering and trading exchange rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland media reported in recent months that bitcoins had become a popular tool for investors to export money out of China, circumventing capital controls that had been tightened by the regulators amid the yuan's sharp depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung Chun-yin, a PwC China fintech partner, said it was possible for bitcoin holders in China to circumvent domestic capital control limits by selling bitcoin to an overseas buyer in exchange for foreign currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In theory, the bitcoin market is borderless, and as long as you could find a buyer overseas, you would be able to get US dollars, and the trade could happen without leaving a trace, with no record in the traditional banking system,” he said, adding that the volume of capital flow through this channel was likely to be quite limited.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/01/13/3c9ab84e-d992-11e6-bbb7-6a43a6f882fe_image_hires.jpg]Zhao Dong, owner of Jiandong Tech, a company that buys and sells bitcoin, agreed that the actual amount of capital leaving the country through bitcoin was not likely to be very high.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Among the 16 million bitcoins already dug out across the world by now, there are around four to five million held by the Chinese. That already caps the total value, while most of the owners are more interested in short-term speculation on the mainland market than exporting them for foreign currencies,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung said that although neither the mainland nor Hong Kong financial regulators had included bitcoin in the existing regulatory framework, bitcoin-related activities were “evolving and bearing the features of traditional financial market activities” and overlapping with the traditional financial system. That makes it more important than ever that the regulators start to take notice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest problem for the Chinese bitcoin market, according to Zhao, is that “the trading platforms are facing the challenge of having to prove themselves innocent” because many investors accuse them of inside trading or market manipulation. The market boom and the quick build-up of leverage had left the market in urgent need of official regulation, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Yunfeng, a senior partner with Zhonglun W&amp;D law firm, based in Shanghai, said he was dealing with an increasing number of bitcoin-related disputes. These included cases of bitcoin theft and scams in which investors have been unable to verify their trading partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The bitcoin market is facing great risks, with turnover and leverage climbing quickly, and mixed up with unregulated foreign-currency trading and money laundering. I think it is time that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> prepared new policies,” he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Industry players said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was mulling the idea of introducing third-party custodian services to govern the market by taking care of the account records, cash or bitcoins on behalf of the platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early August, investor confidence in bitcoin took another knock when </span><span class="s3">Bitfinex</span><span class="s1">, a prominent Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange, reported the theft of about US$65.8 million worth of bitcoins.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 119,756 bitcoins were lost in a security breach, the company said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early 2014, Japan-based bitcoin exchange </span><span class="s3">MtGox</span><span class="s1"> collapsed over the loss of nearly US$390 million worth of the virtual currency.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Welcome to the South China Morning Post's coverage of the press conference of </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> officials on Friday on the sidelines of the country's annual plenary meetings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the press conference in Beijing that began in the morning, People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan and other top </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> officials are expected to discuss a wide range of economic issues including the yuan, market regulations, capital control and other financial risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read on to see the highlights of Zhou's comments as they flow in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">11.35am</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On third-party payment services, Fan Yifei, PBOC deputy governor, said the sector had accumulated lots of risks amid its rapid development in the past several years. The central bank has set up initial regulations and would pay more attention to its implementation. There were many players in the market, leading to over-competition, Fan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The day of reckoning is nigh for fintech startups [https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2074178/day-reckoning-nigh-fintech-startups]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, he warned that internal risk control was loose as there was insufficient protection for investors. Investor data was sometimes leaked or their principal embezzled, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On fintech, PBOC chief Zhou said the development of technology would lead to big changes of future payment services. China encouraged the development of financial technology, especially internet technology and virtual currency, and would cooperate with industry participants, he said. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would also try to prevent risks that might hamper the sector's healthy development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">11.25am</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On corporate leverage, Yi Gang, vice-governor of the central bank, said China's household and government leverage was not extremely high, but corporate leverage is relatively high globally speaking. Rising leverage could accumulate risks and a solution to reduce leverage was to develop direct financing, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PBOC chief Zhou said companies with high leverage should reform themselves. Banks should not support such companies excessively. Financial institutions should help with the central government's “reduce inventory, leverage and capacity” initiatives and supply-side reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">11.15am</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had lots of tools to guide market expectation and prices, but the recent move to raise money market rates should not be overinterpreted. A prudent and neutral monetary policy would help structural reform. “A loose policy will not have enough pressure for reform,” he said, adding that financing difficulties would be eased gradually.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the opening of China's bond market, Zhou said Beijing was not implementing any special policies to aggressively pursue the inclusion of yuan-denominated bonds in any index, but was eyeing a gradual progress. Pan Gongsheng, head of the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, said China would create a friendlier environment in terms of legal system, accounting, auditing, taxation and ratings services, and enhance cross-border cooperation with other financial markets in a bid to make its bond market more attractive. As at the end of last year, foreign institutions and firms had issued more than 60 billion yuan of so-called panda bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">11.10am</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's financial regulation coordination mechanism studied the regulation of asset management businesses recently, Zhou said. There were different standards, lots of arbitrage opportunities and too strong speculation in the wealth management product market, he said. Financial products must serve for the real economy. The financial regulation coordination mechanism could be further improved to a “more effective level”, Zhou said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">11.05am</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the US-China interest rate difference, Zhou said it was true that in the short-term, money flowed to countries where interest rates were higher. But for the medium-term, countries decide their interest rates based on economic growth, employment, confidence and inflation. Interest rate differences did not necessarily lead to persistent speculation and capital flow, he said, citing the example of Japan, which has kept its rates low for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">11am</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign exchange rate was stabilising following the stabilisation of the Chinese economy, structural reform progress and a resurgence of international confidence, Zhou said. There would be “ no big changes” in forex policy this year, but existing polices would be implemented “more delicately”. The yuan exchange rate should be relatively stable this year, he added. He also said fluctuations in the yuan exchange rate in the second half of last year were due to China's accelerated outbound investments and surprises from US presidential election results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange regulator has asked for cooperation from multinationals, including </span><span class="s3">Sony</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">BMW</span><span class="s1">, Daimler, Shell, </span><span class="s3">Pfizer</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">IBM</span><span class="s1"> and Visa, to manage and control the flow of capital out the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The request was made public in a report on the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">'s website after the regulator's chief addressed a delegation of foreign businesses in China at a symposium in Beijing on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A stable and good foreign exchange is in line with the common interests of regulators and market players and it requires joint efforts from all sides,” Pan Gongsheng was quoted as saying.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The meeting came as many foreign businesses are complaining, albeit privately, about Beijing's tightened controls and vetting of outbound remittances and payments as it attempts to stem the flow of cash out the country after the nation's currency has weakened against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government says it is merely implementing existing rules and regulations and it has not imposed any fresh capital account control measures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jacob Parker, vice-president of the US-China Business Council, told the South China Morning Post last week that Beijing's capital account controls have affected the dividend payments of its members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our companies fully understand the rationale behind [capital controls] is to ease the downward pressure on the yuan and they support that goal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Unfortunately, these restrictions are impacting not only capital account transactions, but also current account transactions,” Parker said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, told the Post that the meeting this week had been extremely encouraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Pan is very keen to know the technical issues that foreign industries have encountered in China,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has tightened capital controls to stem the risk of constant capital outflows since late 2015 and the efforts intensified late last year as Chinese overseas investment deals were called off and outbound remittances placed under extra scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Details of the talks this week between the foreign exchange regulator and the big-name foreign investors in China were not released on the website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report said both sides had “candid” exchanges and foreign firms had made “very good” suggestions about the regulator's management of foreign exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A picture of the meeting published by the regulator showed about 30 people crammed into a meeting room, with Chinese officials sitting on one side of a table and corporate representatives on the other.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflows from China have eased since the start of the year, but many analysts expect the restrictions to stay in place for some time given the major uncertainties facing global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These include the talks over Britain's exit from the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">, elections in France and Germany and uncertainties over Donald Trump's trade and economic policies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan, who is also a vice-governor at the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said that the regulator would further aid cross-border trade and investment to “better serve businesses and economic activities”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regulator would also “firmly prevent cross-border capital flow risks and enhance foreign exchange market regulation according to laws” for a “healthy, stable and good” market order, he was quoted as saying.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Parker at the </span><span class="s3">US-China Business Council</span><span class="s1"> said in last week's interview that “despite the positive rhetoric from [the central bank] at the local level, regulators continue to put quotas on banks for converting a certain amount of currency each month”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai, China's most developed metropolis, is backtracking from its resolution to become a service hub, and falling back on its tested manufacturing base to grease the wheels of commerce and growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city had boasted of unbending faith in the service sectors, which would transform it into a global financial and shipping centre by 2020. Gone are the upbeat rhetoric of such an ascension, but in its place, officials are quietly mapping out new plans to rejuvenate Shanghai's manufacturing industry and reclaim China's economic locomotive status.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final wake up call came when Shanghai's industrial output dropped seven per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2016. Officials knew it was time to act.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There have been increasing questions about Shanghai's manufacturing sectors following years of declines," said Chen Mingbo, head of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology. "We have an answer today: with efficient coordination, Shanghai's manufacturing industry still has big growth potential."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen admitted that the shrinking contribution of the manufacturing sectors to the economy weighed on local government officials who decided to take drastic actions to stem the slide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing a press conference earlier this week, he stressed the importance of ensuring sustainability in driving the growth of Shanghai's manufacturing businesses, albeit the city's land scarcity for industrial development and rising living costs.There have been increasing questions about Shanghai's manufacturing sectors following years of declinesChen Mingbo, Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As he shed light on the development plan, Chen pointed out that 1 square kilometre of industrial area should generate at least economic output of 1 billion yuan (US$147 million) a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outdated and creaky factories and companies would be replaced by high-tech and promising money spinners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city pledged to attract more than 60 key industrial projects with annual output of more than 1 billion yuan each between 2016 and 2020, Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotechnology, new materials, industrial internet, semiconductor, smart car and airplane manufacturing are singled out to propel Shanghai's further growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They will feed into the government's blueprint drawn up in May to reinforce the return of manufacturing businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the grand scheme, Shanghai would reserve more land for promising companies, offering preferential rents and incentives such as lower tax payments for small technology firms to enhance their manufacturing might.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They had also actively pitched global industrial stars such as </span><span class="s3">Microsoft</span><span class="s1"> to expand their investments in the city, Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shanghai's reputation can be a draw to the Fortune Global 500 companies," Chen said. "They are interested in working with us."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cen Fukang, a deputy director of the Shanghai Planning, Land and Resources Administration, said the city government would keep a flat fee on land-use for the prospective companies for the next 20 years, a departure from the current practice where fees are raised periodically.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai has over the past two years refrained from touting its efforts to build a world-class financial centre after the slow progress made in liberalising the financial markets. To be fair, financial deregulation entails central government decision makers, and is something beyond the authorities in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2009, the city had for the first time officially unveiled its global financial hub ambition, in tandem with Beijing's efforts to internationalise the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Piggybacking on the city leaders' focus on finance until now, Shanghai's service sectors accounted for 67.8 per cent of the local gross domestic product (GDP) last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A developed city can't do without flourishing a manufacturing industry," said Bob Zhou, chief executive of Shanghai-based investment group Yinshu Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is necessary to go back to manufacturing businesses as the city attempts to regain its growth momentum."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai has lagged behind its provincial-level counterparts in term of economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between 2008 and 2015, its GDP growth was eclipsed by the national average as its manufacturing sectors slumped.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/03/01621ef6-47a2-11e7-935d-dac9335a3205_image_hires_005602.jpg]It is under pressure to chase industrial output growth as an increasing number of manufacturers, both home-grown and foreign-invested, relocate their facilities to other mainland cities or to overseas markets, where costs are lower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To move its manufacturing sectors up the value chain, the city has massively adjusted its economic structure since 1990s, closing down a large number of light-industry companies such as textile and daily necessities makers that were struggling with thinning profit margins.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since China began economic reform in the 1980s, Shanghai residents had taken pride in a clutch of brands including Forever bicycles, White Rabbit candies, Feiyue colour TVs and Bright milk which were among the best-selling products on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the brands have faded in oblivion due to cut-throat competition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 1985, Shanghai's auto making industry was catapulted into international limelight after </span><span class="s3">SAIC Motor</span><span class="s1"> established a joint venture with </span><span class="s3">Volkswagen</span><span class="s1"> to produce sedans for the then fledgling car market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, the manufacturing sectors represented only a quarter of the city's GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Export-oriented businesses are increasingly finding themselves in a bind as the city loses its lustre as a gateway to the rest of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan Lamei, owner of a garment company that sells clothes to the European markets, said net profit margins had fallen to a scant 8 per cent from more than 30 per cent a decade ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Wage inflation continues, and it's increasingly difficult to get orders from foreign clients as they set eyes on the manufacturers in Southeast Asia," she said. "For manufacturing businesses, it looks as if our days are numbered."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">City officials do not think so.For manufacturing businesses, it looks as if our days are numberedYuan Lamei, garment manufacturer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen said a year of efforts to bolster manufacturing businesses have paid off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter of this year, industrial output in Shanghai grew 6.7 per cent from the same period in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government has the power to push the development of mega projects," he said, adding that corporate giants owned by the central government and foreign investors would be lured to help create new jobs and growth engines for Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Shanghai officials relished a successful maiden flight of the country's first self-made narrow-bodied passenger jet, signifying the country's goal to compete for the global industrial crown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The C919 aircraft assembled by Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China</span><span class="s1"> (Comac) represents arguably China's boldest attempt to break the duopoly of </span><span class="s3">Airbus</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Boeing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Comac and Russia's </span><span class="s3">United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) </span><span class="s1">also officially started operations of their 50-50 joint venture in late May in Shanghai to develop a long-haul, wide-bodied passenger plane.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The double-aisle plane is expected to conduct a first flight in 2022, with deliveries beginning as early as 2025.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2013, Shanghai established the mainland's first free-trade zone that aims to facilitate free commodity and capital flows across the border. Interests have been at best modest, with few foreign and domestic companies reaping substantial benefits from the freedom of doing businesses inside the so-called mini-Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It faces competition against another 10 similar zones across the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the ground reality is that Shanghai is still a thriving marketplace to do businesses," said Cao Hua, a partner at Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Businesses all the way from catering to plane-making will gravitate to Shanghai, because it is the metropolis where millions of people have plenty of money to spend. The key lies in what products and services you can make to meet their needs."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> urged Beijing on Wednesday to resume progress towards a flexible exchange rate, in a subtle criticism of China's recent interventions in support of the yuan currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> also said China should speed up reforms to ward off financial risks, after two weeks of discussions with Chinese officials during its annual review of the health of the world's second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the fund, said in a statement that China should gradually strengthen its monetary policy framework, allowing the yuan to move more freely and improving communications with markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Capital flow measures should be applied transparently and consistently. Further capital account liberalisation should be carefully sequenced with the necessary supporting reforms, including an effective monetary policy framework, sound financial system, and exchange rate flexibility," Lipton said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The annual meeting came less than a month after </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> changed its daily yuan reference rate formula, introducing a "counter-cyclical factor", aimed, it said, at reducing volatility in the currency.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some near-term risks have receded, reform progress needs to accelerate to secure medium-term stability and address the risk that the current trajectory of the economy could eventually lead to a sharp adjustment," the statement said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a source familiar with the matter confirmed earlier reports in a Chinese magazine that he had been “assisting” an investigation into alleged irregularities at the company and has not returned to his office or home since the end of last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts are worried his apparent disappearance - which comes amid a wide-ranging government campaign to impose discipline in the financial markets - could lead to a liquidity crunch that infects the wider industry.The most worrying issue would be an intensivecancellation of [insurance] policies which would severely weigh on Anbang's cash flowGuo Zhenhua, Shanghai University of International Business and Economics</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu's case could undermine a widely-held public perception of Anbang as one of China's most resourceful and powerful companies, according to Guo Zhenhua, head of the insurance department at Shanghai University of International Business and Economics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The most worrying issue would be an intensive cancellation of [insurance] policies which would severely weigh on Anbang's cash flow,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has relied heavily on selling high-risk, short-term insurance policies to beef up its war chest for takeover bids through the capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital flow into Anbang will inevitably slow down because of Wu's case and the enhanced scrutiny of regulators, which will make the company's situation difficult, said Guo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Anbang Life Insurance</span><span class="s1">, the flagship of </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance Group</span><span class="s1">, reported a solvency ratio of 129 by the end of the first quarter, a sharp drop from 290 per cent in the same period of 2016, but still above the 100 per cent regulatory red line. Solvency ratio is a measurement that broadly describes a company's ability to cover the financial risks it takes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang has been at the forefront of developing and promoting short-term, high-yield insurance policies, known as universal life insurance and similar to wealth management products, which in turn has fuelled a spending spree by the firm both in China and abroad in the past few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu himself has become a household name in China based on his reputation for raising huge sums of money in the blink of an eye, his marriage to former leader Deng Xiaoping's granddaughter, and his powerful connections with regulators and the second generations of China's former leaders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of several publicly traded companies part-owned by </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance Group</span><span class="s1"> fell in Hong Kong and mainland China on Wednesday. Publicly available information shows Anbang holds major stakes (above 5 per cent) in eight firms listed in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang-owned stocks decline in Hong Kong, China in sign of strain at country's biggest asset buyer[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2098268/anbang-owned-stocks-decline-hong-kong-china-sign-strain-countrys]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The aggressive investment style of insurance companies and the potential mismatch of liabilities and assets caught the attention of the authorities at the end of last year. Some of the country's most senior figures launched a campaign to rid the financial markets of risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) </span><span class="s1">has been taking stringent measures to curb the risky, short-term products pioneered by Anbang and favoured by insurers since the high-profile dismissal of its former chairman Xiang Junbo in April. Xiang himself had been an active promoter of the universal life products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On May 5, Anbang Life was prohibited from issuing new products for a period of three months, after the CIRC found one of its annuity products had “violated the regulator's rules and disturbed market order”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China insurance regulator bars Anbang from new product issuance for three months[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2093165/china-insurance-regulator-bars-anbang-new-product-issuance-three]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About a week later, the regulator expanded its crackdown to the whole sector, issuing a circular spelling out the how life insurance policies should be structured, and banning the sale of universal life insurance as an add-on to regular policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts believe Beijing is well aware of Anbang's vast trove of holdings in the capital markets, and will have to work carefully to avoid turmoil spreading from Wu's case.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would partly explain why Beijing apparently attempted to suppress the news that Wu was being probed bydeleting the first reports last night. They would have been attempting to keep the situation stable by keeping Wu's case out of the public realm, said an insurance analyst with a state-owned fund company, who didn't wish to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caijing, a popular Chinese magazine, first reported that the chairman had been taken away for investigation, citing anonymous sources. The article was quickly taken offline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“All parties, including the government, share a common desire to shield Anbang from an unsustainable cascade of policy cancellations. The government would also be very adverse to any large-scale defaults prior to the upcoming 19th Party Congress this fall,” said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based financial advisory firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Wu had shown an ability to quickly raise vast sums of money, though his methods have often been questioned. Most importantly, uncertainty surrounds the case as full details of his situation are yet to emerge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fosun's Guo Guangchang faced similar issues, without lasting detriment,” Silvers added. He was referring to the case another high-profile billionaire, who chairs Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group. Guo was reported to be out of contact when assisting authorities with a probe in December 2015, but he showed up three days later to deliver a public speech, and later said the probe was not about his business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang held a 3.4 per cent and 5.3 per cent share of the national insurance premium market in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Its market share of all investment-type products was much higher at 6.4 per cent and 19.4 per cent in those two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's total assets are currently worth about 1.97 trillion yuan based on information on its website, a report issued by Jefferies said on Wednesday morning.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is expected to maintain a tight grip on capital outflows despite foreign exchange reserves rising for a fifth straight month in June, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, July 11</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here is a little secret about how the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> treats foreign reserves at home in its own books.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It calls them foreign assets, it expresses them only in yuan and not in US dollar terms as it does the separate foreign reserves entry and, most of all, it shows them at the original cost of acquisition, not at current market values as it does for foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If it had shown them at current market value, then at the height of their build-up in mid-2015, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would also have shown an unrealised currency translation loss of about US$760 billion, or about 200 times its own capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, with a drawdown in reserves and a somewhat weaker US dollar this has now become only about US$190 billion or about 60 times capital. No, they never rushed to tell you about all this.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the reason I tell you now is that the contrast between these two accounting treatments also allows me to tell you that, as the first chart shows, foreign reserves have not really risen for the last five months, not as in a return to a build-up of reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China to maintain tight rein on capital outflows despite gains in forex reserves[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/2101975/china-maintain-tight-rein-capital-outflows-despite-gains]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All that has happened is that the reserves have risen in US dollar terms because their non-US dollar components have risen in dollar terms with a weaker dollar. I know this because the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s yuan accounts continue to show foreign assets declining. It's slow but it's still down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even this, however, does not tell you the full story about capital outflows. The reserves are only a balancing item on the balance of payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus if the current account, which represents trade transactions, shows a US$170 billion net inflow and the capital account, which represents investment transactions, shows a US$170 billion outflow, the two will be balanced and that balancing item of foreign reserves will not change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there will still have been that US$170 billion capital outflow despite the tight grip exerted by the authorities. And this is what has transpired over the last year, right to that US$170 billion number.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, it is probably more than this. The second chart shows you that the current account and merchandise trade balances were equal in early 2010. Since then other trade components of the current account have gone into deficit so that the current account surplus is now barely a third of the trade surplus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forget the statements, China's capital outflow is still enormous[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2070143/forget-statements-chinas-capital-outflow-still-enormous]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two trends are notable here. For one, mainland tourist spending per person has unaccountably doubled over the last five years. I suspect that at least US$100 billion a year of this is people stashing, rather than spending, money abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There was also a big plunge in net unrequited transfers over the last five years. I would guess about US$40 billion of this is undeclared capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus the exodus continues, slower, but still flowing out.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's asset management sector “is likely to” shrink in scale but would be of improved quality as Chinese regulators step up joint efforts to weed out irregularities, a central bank official told a forum over the weekend in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tao Ling, deputy head of the financial stability bureau at the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, said on Saturday that tighter scrutiny would help squeeze out the bubble, rule out regulatory arbitrage and trim over-leverage, resulting in a possible downsized but better quality sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This would help steer capital flow to the real economy, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tao didn't indicate the scale of the downsized sector, but provided some details on the six identified irregularities that could lead to cross-sector risks amid increasingly intertwined financial transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They include different standards among different regulators, complex and opaque products, ill business operations and implicit guarantees that are hard to break and could distort pricing of capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank is leading the nation's banking, securities and insurance regulators in drafting new rules governing the asset management sector.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they will include supervision of unlicensed non-financial institutions, on top of a mechanism to regulate the whole asset management process, that is from product issuance, capital raising to investment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While stressing the significance of the scrutiny, she also said there would be space for financial innovation, and better communication with market players to manage expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Ren Huichuang, president of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) who also attended the forum, the asset management sector was estimated to have rapidly grown to 114 trillion yuan (US$17 trillion) by the end of 2016, with a compound annual growth rate of 39 per cent in the past three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ren said the sector was already witnessing signs of a scaleback in the first half, as the market was responding to regulators' increased scrutiny.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The time is now right to allow greater volatility in the Chinese currency's exchange rate with the dollar, a state-run newspaper said in a front-page commentary, signalling that Beijing's concerns over the sharp depreciation in the yuan are easing as the greenback's value slides.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has been on the defensive over the value of the yuan for nearly two years after its abrupt two per cent devaluation of the currency in August 2015 roiled global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has taken a slew of measures, from draconian curbs on capital outflow to the adoption of opaque and complex changes to the yuan exchange regime, to keep the currency from weakening sharply.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China Securities Journal, a newspaper run by the state-run </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> news agency, said in an editorial on Tuesday that it was now time for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to tolerate greater volatility in the yuan exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The one-sided bet on yuan deprecation has been broken," the editorial said "Cross-border capital flow has been stabilised and improved in the first half, while supply and demand in the forex market has basically balanced - it is in the most balanced period for the past three years. It's good timing for China to boost yuan exchange rate flexibility in the short term."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has already advanced to a nine-month high against the US dollar. The US dollar index, which compares its value with a basket of currencies, now hovers at a near one-year low as the value of the greenback weakens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves have also been stabilised at a level of US$3 trillion over the past months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> efforts to defeat those who bet on a big slump in the yuan, while successful at face value, have also invited suspicions over whether Beijing is peddling back on its market-oriented liberalisation of the exchange regime to a "managed floating system".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Xiaohui, an assistant governor at the central bank, wrote in an article published in the latest edition of China Finance, a central bank journal, that the authorities would "unswervingly" push ahead with yuan exchange rate liberalisation to give the market a decisive role in deciding the yuan's value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China Securities Journal editorial said Beijing's measures to bolster the value of the yuan were merely "temporary tools in a transitional period" and the direction of market-oriented reforms have not changed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Jian, a senior analyst at the Bank of Communications in Shanghai, said a key move to increase flexibility was to expand the trading band, moving the yuan-to-dollar daily trading range to three per cent for the Euro, Japanese yen and other major currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore spot price is currently allowed to fluctuate within two per cent of the daily midpoint. The last expansion of the trading band from one per cent was announced in March 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, more than 60 per cent of daily fluctuations in trading so far this year were less than 0.1 per cent, according to data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fluctuations of more than 0.3 per cent were only recorded on 11 working days, with the one per cent level never breached.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To boost the two-way fluctuations, China needs to allow more players in the forex market and expand forex derivatives as well," said Liu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has ordered the establishment of a nationwide clearing house for online payment services, instructing them to route their transactions via the new platform, to shield consumers and the financial system from an internet-enabled model of finance that's already made up almost 3 per cent of the country's non-cash payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China National Clearing Centre -- the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">'s settlements and clearing arm -- signed an agreement on July 28 to establish the platform's operating company with 44 financial firms, including </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">' affiliate Ant Financial, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1">'s affiliate, according to an August 1 statement by HyUnion Holding Co.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks and online payment systems including Alibaba's AliPay and Tencent's Tenpay must connect to the new platform by October 15, and be ready to route transactions through it from June 30, 2018, according to a notice by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new platform is the internet version of UnionPay's clearing service for bank-to-bank transactions, while the new platform is for transactions involving third-party online payment firms and banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current direct connection model bypasses the central bank's clearing system, making it difficult for regulators to track and monitor the capital flow of those payments, leaving loopholes for money laundering and other irregularities,” said Wang Pengbo, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For consumers, a unified nationwide platform and unified regulations, mean a safer payment online, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online payments through non-bank payment services expanded 60 per cent in the first quarter to 47 billion transactions valued at 26.47 trillion yuan (US$3.9 trillion), 43 per cent more than last year, according to the central bank's data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two services dominate China's online payments, with Alibaba's AliPay taking 54 per cent of the market, while Tencent's Tenpay -- also known as </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> Pay or </span><span class="s3">WePay</span><span class="s1"> -- has 40 per cent, according to Analysys' estimate. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Juliana Huang, a senior executive with a multinational company in Beijing, invested well during the property boom in the Chinese capital and over the years has owned several flats in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many Chinese investors, however, Huang has in recent times sought to liquidate some of her investments and move the funds overseas, in the belief they will be safer there. Her market of choice is the US, where she now holds a healthy portfolio of stocks and funds, all denominated in US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves hit a seven-month high[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2097339/chinas-forex-reserves-hit-seven-month-high]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The desire among China's wealthy to convert their yuan-based assets into foreign currencies has been a headache for Beijing. But despite its efforts to curb capital outflows, the problem has become one of the "grey rhino" risks to the economy that are considered too big to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose for a sixth straight month in July, suggesting Beijing's efforts to slow capital outflows and boost inflows were paying dividends. However, an economist said the growth in the figures should not be overplayed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rise in foreign exchange reserves is partly a result of currency valuation changes in the portfolio," said Wang Tao, chief China economist with </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">. "A rise in reserves doesn't mean a net capital inflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the government does not release the currency structure of its reserve portfolio, it is generally estimated that the US dollar accounts for about two thirds of the US$3 trillion stockpile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China to maintain tight rein on capital outflows despite gains in forex reserves[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/2101975/china-maintain-tight-rein-capital-outflows-despite-gains]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to a weakening greenback, the yuan has gained steadily against the US dollar this year. The movement is also likely to have led to an appreciation in assets dominated in euros and yen, resulting in a nominal rise in the nation's foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xie Yaxuan, chief economist with China Merchants Securities, estimated that the valuation change contributed to a nominal rise of US$29.1 billion in July, which in effect means China's reserves fell by US$5.2 billion in the month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similarly, if measured by the Special Drawing Rights - the accounting unit used by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> - China's reserves have fallen in each of the past five months, from 2.2196 trillion SDR at the end of February to 2.1884 trillion at the end of July, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another measure of capital flow, namely yuan positions resulting from foreign exchange purchases, has been in decline for 21 months, indicating a steady capital outflow. The better news for Beijing is that the fall in July was only 4.6 billion yuan, down from 34.3 billion in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite disciplining some of the country's big global deal makers, including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, earlier in the year for their lavish overseas spending, the government still has a long way to go to stem the outward flow of investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Zhengwei, chief economist with Industrial Bank in Shanghai, said the outflow pressure in the second half of 2017 "will be bigger than the first half".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Yu Yongding, an outspoken economist with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"> and a former adviser to the central bank, said that China has been facing serious capital flight for years and that the chronic problem is unlikely to go away any time soon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang certainly has no plans to stop moving her money out of the country. She even hinted at ways to bypass the limit of US$50,000 worth of foreign currency that Chinese citizens are allowed to buy each year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If a further 60 million Chinese thought like her, and each exercised their right to purchase exchange their maximum allowance of foreign currency, China's US$3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves would be wiped out overnight.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflows from China are expected to slow further after the sharp strength in the yuan has reversed investors' depreciation expectations, according to Iris Pang, Greater China economist at </span><span class="s3">ING Bank</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> is creating fast appreciation of the yuan because it is determined to stop outflows and maintain the nation's foreign exchange reserves above the psychologically important US$3 trillion level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Central bank reserves rose US$24 billion to US$3.08 trillion in August, from a five-year low of US$2.998 billion in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan appreciated 2.0 per cent in August, the biggest monthly gain since July 2005. It was trading at around 6.5599 per dollar on September 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect no more capital outflows starting from August,” Pang said. “The yuan needs to be strong because we don't want outflows, we want inflows.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pang expects the government will ensure the yuan continues to rise until inflows surpass outflows persistently, forecasting the yuan to hit 6.65 to the dollar by year end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month's guidelines on outbound investment by the State Council, China's cabinet, appeared to suggest capital controls would remain in place this year, via so-called window guidance to restrict remittances by foreign companies in China to their parents abroad, Pang said</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, regulators may provide window guidance by telling companies not to remit funds verbally and privately, even though there is no official public announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has been aiming to control flows to prevent the chance of sudden, massive outflows in currency that would case, Pang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Using revenue from the mainland to payback offshore loans when they become due in two years time, will exert depreciation pressure on the yuan, Pang said, and in turn have a negative impact to the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese conglomerates borrowing offshore loans for overseas acquisitions may lead to borrowing repayments coming from their main revenue streams in future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Using revenue from the mainland to payback offshore loans when they become due in two years time, will exert depreciation pressure on the yuan, Pang said, and in turn have a negative impact to the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is very long-term planning on capital flow movements,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's sharp appreciation, along with an acceleration of state-owned enterprise reforms seen in August, are setting the scene for all-the important five-yearly 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which will convene in Beijing on October 18, at which future economic policy will be outlined.It is now clear the government wants to clean up the smaller SOEs and merge the big ones into giantsIris Pang, Greater China economist at </span><span class="s3">ING Bank</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pang expects high-level statements from the Congress to show a continuation of the government's deleveraging efforts, and reductions in industrial overcapacity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent proposed merger of coal giant </span><span class="s3">Shenhua Group</span><span class="s1"> and power major Guodian Group to create what many consider will become the world's largest energy giant, signals the government will continue to support large SOEs gain bargaining power for overseas investments, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But smaller, provincial SOEs will be cleaned up through market-oriented processes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The successful deleveraging of the coal and steel sectors, in particular, will be set as a role model for other smaller, provincial SOEs such as cement producers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is now clear the government wants to clean up the smaller SOEs and merge the big ones into giants,” Pang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The agreement by bondholders last week, meanwhile, to accept a 78 per cent haircut on debt - the first such SOE bond reduction in China - has also dashed hopes of investors of other defaulting debt that they might be fully repaid, Pang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bondholders of state-backed steel mill </span><span class="s3">Dongbei Special Steel Group</span><span class="s1"> agreed to take a 78 per cent reduction of the amount that will be repaid to creditors, to just 22 per cent cash, according to an official statement last week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) outright on Monday, the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> followed up by asking banks and payment companies to stop opening accounts for digital coin fundraising platforms and to restrict payments into and out of related individual accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said in a notice made public on Tuesday that banks and payment companies must search individual accounts related to cryptocurrency platforms and restrict any transactions in cases where large sums or frequent capital transfers are discovered. The aim is to ward off capital risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The notice, although issued from the central bank's operations office that only regulates the Beijing market, gives specific implementation guidelines to the nationwide ban on the practice of initial coin offerings (ICOs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, seven state regulators including the central bank and the top banking, securities and insurance watchdogs, jointly issued a circular aimed at cleaning up the increasingly popular but unregulated practice of fundraising through digital coins.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ICOs allow digital coin start-ups to raise funds by creating and selling digital tokens. The government declared such fundraising illegal and fraudulent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The checks on the banking and payment accounts of the platforms is one of the most effective ways to ward off capital risks,” said Shi Pengfeng, co-founder of wdzj.com, a website monitoring the internet finance industry. “If those [cryptocurrency] platforms dare to disobey the government ban, the authorities can curb their capital flow through regulations on banks and payment companies instead.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authorities may have learned from their previous experiences dealing with internet finance in taking such swift actions to nip ICOs in the bud. Such fundraising transactions can be easily manipulated for fraud purposes because to their low entry and widespread reach to public investors, said Shi.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ICOs have grown rapidly in China this year as companies raised a combined 2.62 billion yuan (US$398 million) from 65 offerings in the first half, according to a report from the Beijing Internet Finance Association. More than 100,000 investors put money in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That compares with 145.2 billion yuan worth of conventional IPOs in China in the same period, involving 269 companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest ban on digital coins fundraising has been swift and effective, with most platforms followed the latest order, Shi noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, Chinese ICO platform ICOINFO said in a notice on Tuesday that it has stopped all </span><span class="s3">ICO</span><span class="s1"> services and is working with issuers of virtual tokens on its platform to repatriate funds to investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At least four projects had already returned funds to investors' accounts and users are able to begin withdrawing funds, it said on its website on Tuesday, adding that more projects are finalising their fund returning plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves hit an 11-month high at the end of September - rising for an eighth straight month - in a fresh sign of economic stability ahead of the Communist Party congress next week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forex reserves rose to US$3.1 trillion by the end of last month, up US$17 billion from August, according to the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, the central bank. The reserves increased by US$10.8 billion in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It followed strong gains in other leading indicators - the purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to a five-year high last month, according to the statistics bureau, while retailers saw a double-digit increase in sales during the “Golden Week” holiday that ended on Sunday, the commerce ministry said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘A yuan should be a yuan', deputy head of China's foreign exchange regulator says[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2111045/yuan-should-be-yuan-deputy-head-chinas-foreign-exchange-regulator]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's success in tackling a depreciating currency and declining forex reserves will mean the new leadership - to be unveiled at the upcoming congress - will be able to turn its attention to deep-rooted structural problems such as the bloated state sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves fell below US$3 trillion in early 2017. But they have steadily recovered over the past eight months, thanks to solid economic growth, a tighter grip on capital outflows and pricing of the yuan to counter depreciation. Some economists now expect Beijing may soon relax controls on outbound payments and individual foreign currency purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As expectations of the yuan's one-way depreciation fade, China is set to restart the opening up of the capital account,” Larry Hu, head of Greater China economics at </span><span class="s3">Macquarie Group</span><span class="s1">, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the initial stage, the central bank may take a low-profile approach by quietly speeding up approvals for outbound payments, and mainland investors may then be allowed to buy bonds in Hong Kong through the Bond Connect programme, Hu said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several economists with links to the central bank and foreign exchange regulator said in a recent report that while China should open its financial sector wider, “moderate and temporary cross-border capital flow management” was needed to help maintain stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Short-term capital flows are the main reason behind China's capital exodus,” China Finance 40 Forum economists led by Guan Tao, a former division head of the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, wrote in a report released at the end of last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Enhancing cross-border capital flow management could help safeguard the independence of monetary policy, maintain financial stability, and ease the negative impact on the economy caused by foreign exchange rate fluctuations,” the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is expected to release its main economic data for September on Thursday next week, and stable economic growth for the third quarter is expected to serve as a ballast to social order as the party congress gets under way.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But while the Chinese government is keen to ensure economic and social stability, an independent PMI reading has come in much lower than the official one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Caixin/Markit services PMI fell to 50.6 in September - the lowest reading since December 2015, and one of the weakest since the survey began in 2005. That was in contrast to an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector that showed it expanded at the fastest clip since 2014 - rising 1.8 points to 54.4 - in September. It also puts the services sector closer to the 50-point mark - below the line indicates contraction, while above means growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It could reflect the growth divergence in different sectors of the economy, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> economists led by Maggie Wei wrote in a research note. However, activity growth overall appeared to be solid in September, and China's gross domestic product was expected to expand 6.9 per cent for the third quarter, they said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stocks in industry leaders on the mainland A-share market have surged by 57 per cent in the first 11 months this year, and this rally is likely to continue in 2018 as market consolidation goes on, said analysts at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have picked the biggest caps in each of the 28 industries categorised by data provider Wind for a study, and found that they rose by about 57 per cent on average year to day, largely outperforming the benchmark," said Chen Li, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">'s China strategist, in a forum in Shenzhen on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rally is likely to continue into 2018, although I would prefer leaders in the segment markets rather than the big first-tier names in big industries," he said, adding that as China continues to push for supply-side reform, which favours bigger industry players while forcing smaller ones out, the big caps will continue to enjoy a rising market share and better business returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has this year gained around 8.6 per cent - by Friday's close it was at 3371.7 - while industry leaders have been rising at a faster pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kweichow Moutai, China's biggest distiller, saw its share price rocket up to 639.2 yuan (US$96.4), up by 91 per cent from 334 yuan in 2016, becoming the most eye-catching blue chip in Shanghai this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mutual funds' weighting of ChiNext, the Shenzhen-based listing of smaller tech companies, has continued the fall since the beginning of this year due to low market risk appetite, tight market liquidity and ChiNext's earnings growth slowing down, Gao Ting, the head of China Strategy at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> wrote in a note on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"During the third quarter, mutual fund investors in the A-share market have been outweighing in beverage, non-ferrous metals and electronics, followed by property developers, banks and insurers …</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We continue to see upside potential for banks. We prefer large banks with adequate capital and low balance-sheet risk, which may benefit from a better non-performing loan ratio," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with the A-share market, the Hong Kong equity market has been undergoing a bigger rally, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index rising by 30 per cent to 28603.6 by Friday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caixin on Wednesday quoted a source close to the State Council as saying that Beijing was considering picking two companies for a pilot and making their non-tradeable shares free-floating, a move that will make the so-call H-share companies - incorporated on the mainland but listed on the offshore Hong Kong market - more liquid.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this will have a limited impact on Hong Kong's secondary market due to its size, and will largely boost the financing ability of the H-share companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, there are 225 H-share companies on the main board. Some of these also have a listed unit on the mainland, making them "unlikely to sell shares in Hong Kong due to the significant A/H premium", analysts with BofA Merrill Lynch wrote in a note on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If all H shares were to become tradeable after the trial, we estimate that owners of less than US$122 billion worth of H shares may be tempted to sell at some point. Although this may put pressure on certain stocks, overall market impact should be limited given the relatively small scale. The move should add to the Hong Kong market's attraction as an IPO destination for mainland companies,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">thus a small positive for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A similar message has been sent out a few times, said Nicole Yuen, the head of North Asia equities at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, while "capital outflow would remain a key concern for regulators if they are really going to push it out".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The full convertibility of pre-IPO shares allows founders or major shareholders of mainland companies to float their shares on the Hong Kong bourse, where non-Chinese investors can trade in them without being qualified investors on the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would test the country's management of capital flow, as the selling of shares on the offshore market will convert equities into offshore capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">'s Li, however, said selling of shares may not be the only option for major holders of H-share listed mainland companies, if they want to raise money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Making all the shares fully circulated will help the mainland companies borrow more money with lower rates from banks, by stake pledging - they do not have to sell the stake. It makes a huge difference in lending if the stake you pledge is liquid," he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves continued to pile up in October, rising for the ninth month in a row, although the increase of US$700 million recorded for the month was the smallest this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">said on Tuesday that its foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.11 trillion at the end of October, showing a picture of a balanced capital flow and offering fresh evidence of Beijing's confidence in its economic prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank has “a stronger grip” on the yuan exchange rate now thanks to the adoption of a murky counter-cyclical factor in setting the daily price of the yuan, Larry Hu, the chief China economist for Macquarie Securities, wrote in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As capital outflows have disappeared from the headlines, we expect the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to further ease capital controls,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The foreign exchange reserve data was released a day ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stable reading for China's foreign exchange stockpile could in theory offer Beijing a more comfortable position when talking with Washington as it is a sign of Chinese economic resilience and the government's overseas spending power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the pressure on the yuan and China's capital flow situation remained modest after Trump nominated Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen at the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> in February as he is widely expected to take a dovish policy stance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, the head of </span><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and a deputy central bank governor, said last month that China was seeing less need to support the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Long, a Beijing-based researcher at Gavekal, wrote that the exchange rate of the yuan was no longer “misaligned” with the fundamentals and that the currency “would not be too vulnerable to another round of dollar strength”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With better fundamentals and a more credible currency policy, volatility in [the yuan's exchange rate] will be less shocking to markets inside and outside China,” he wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a statement published on Monday, China's foreign exchange regulator said the country had returned to a “twin surplus” in both its current account and capital account in the first three quarters of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's current account surplus was US$106.3 billion in the first nine months of this year, or about 1.2 per cent of its gross domestic product.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, it reported a US$60.8 billion surplus in its financial account for the first nine months, a big turnaround from a deficit of US$389 billion in the same period last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Issues with moving capital between countries involved in the Chinese government's ambitious “Belt and Road Initiative” are limiting the success of the project, according to industry players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The major problem facing the Belt and Road Initiative is the flow of capital,” said Justin Kwok Hung-chiu, executive director of CK Asset Holdings, at the MIPIM Asia Summit, a leading property conference, on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether there is free flow of capital into the country and whether you can repatriate your capital, these are major issues.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said a key challenge for businesses looking to invest was strict KYC, or know-your-customer, requirements, which banks use to identify and verify the identity of their clients to reduce financial crimes such as money laundering and fraud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Initiated by Xi Jinping in 2013, the belt and road plan is aimed at building infrastructure, including railways, ports, airports and roads, in countries neighbouring China and in other parts of Asia, the Middle East and Europe, to boost trade flows and economic growth.Certainly in the last six months, we noticed a slowdown in the outbound investment along the Belt and RoadAdam Rush, senior director Cushman and Wakefield</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strategy is at the heart of a soft-power push by China, and is backed by hundreds of billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. To date, more than 70 countries and international organisations have signed up for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite the fact that so many parties have confirmed their participation, industry insiders said the challenge was at the business level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Certainly in the last six months, we noticed a slowdown in the outbound investment along the belt and road,” said Adam Rush, senior director at commercial real estate broker Cushman and Wakefield, at the MIPIM summit. “A lot of it is related to capital issues about how to raise capital in countries where there are difficulties with the regulatory system.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, China has been dealt with a couple of setbacks in its plan. Two major projects - a US$2.5 billion deal to build the Budhigandaki hydroelectric dam in Nepal, and the US$14 billion Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan - have been cancelled because the terms were not considered to be fair and equitable by the respective governments.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian capital is pouring into Europe's real estate markets, led by commercial property deals by Hong Kong and Chinese investors and by logistics platform acquisitions, and is increasingly looking beyond the traditional favoured destination of London to other cities across the continent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the fourth quarter of 2017 alone, Asian investors put some 16 billion euros (US$18.8 billion) into European property in deals worth over 5 million euros, up from just below 6 billion euros the quarter before and compared to around 6 billion euros in total for deals of the same size in the whole of 2012, according to property data analysis firm </span><span class="s3">Real Capital Analytics</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">North American investors have spent more than Asian players so far in 2017, but the lift from Asia has led to a record share for non-European investors of almost 40 per cent of the European market, roughly double that of 2012, the company said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The wave of capital is really starting here in Asia and coming up against the European shores. We are seeing a huge amount of capital flow into the market,” said Simon Mallinson, executive managing director at Real Capital Analytics, speaking at the MIPIM Asia property conference in Hong Kong. “What that is leading to is a record share for global players in Europe.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong players alone have spent US$7.3 billion in London so far this year, according to Real Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March London's Leadenhall Building, better known as the “Cheesegrater”, was bought by Hong Kong-listed property developer CC Land Holdings for £1.13 billion (US$1.5 billion), while in July the</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">20 Fenchurch Street property, known as the “Walkie-Talkie”, was sold to sauce maker Lee Kum Kee International Holdings for £1.3 billion in a record transaction for a single building in the UK.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite political uncertainty after the UK voted to leave the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> in June 2016, London remained the top target market for Asian property investors, with Frankfurt coming in second and Amsterdam third.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong buyers make beeline for London assets, lured by stable rent, rule of law, cheap money[http://www.scmp.com/property/international/article/2116753/hong-kong-buyers-make-beeline-london-assets-lured-stable-rent]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“London remains the major destination for Asian buyers, especially first-time buyers, due to liquidity, a sophisticated legal system, a simple tax structure and it being an English-speaking country,” said Henry Chin, head of research for the Asia-Pacific at CBRE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, we see that Asian investors are expanding their radar outside London as well as outside the UK”, he said, with many South Koreans targeting cities like Frankfurt, Berlin, Austria and Amsterdam, for higher yields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Germany has been a particular target, with the total amount of Asian property investment into Germany for the first half of 2017 surpassing that for the whole of 2016, according to Chin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Germany has always been a safe haven,” said Jan Jescow Stoehr, director of risk management at real estate investment firm KamAm Grund Group, at the conference. “It is a very strong country with a strong economy - there is a small layer of political uncertainty but it won't have an impact globally. Business is driving investment demands from outside.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several international banks including </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1"> have said they are planning to move thousands of London-based jobs out of the UK following Brexit, and may choose Frankfurt as their new trading hub inside the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But competition from domestic players in Germany could hinder Asian investment, according to Tom Leahy, a senior director at Real Capital Analytics. While UK institutions have largely left prime assets to overseas buyers from Asia and the Middle East, German domestic competition is stiffer, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another area where Asian money is increasing its prominence in Europe is in logistics properties, with investors showing signs of looking beyond the traditional UK market in search of higher yields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October Asia's biggest warehouse operator, Singapore-listed Global Logistic Properties, acquired European industrial property company Gazeley for US$2.8 billion in its first push into the continent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private equity group Blackstone sold the European logistics real estate company </span><span class="s3">Logicor</span><span class="s1"> in June to </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> for 12.25 billion euros in the largest recorded private equity real estate deal in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some big American players are building big logistics platforms which are then being sold on to more long-term investors: built using American-backed capital and sold to Asian-backed capital. Logistics is powering ahead in terms of activity,” said Real Capital's Mallinson.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When bank governors of 10 of China's biggest banks gathered in a hotel in West Shanghai's Hongkou district on November 30 to protest against draft rules issued by regulators to consolidate the country's 100 trillion yuan (US$15 trillion) financial services industry under a single regulatory umbrella, they were worried the regulatory tightening, if not carried out gradually, was likely to backfire as interbank liquidity would drain too fast, causing defaults and lead to a chain of failures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts warn that although bearish sentiment on China had flipped in 2017, with its equities posting respectable gains, currency stabilising, and capital outflow curbed, some of the risks and challenges the country faces in the coming year must not be overlooked.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overtightening, which will send jitters from money markets to the property sector, is one of the key risks that China has to manage with caution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such risks have been given added urgency, as hundreds of China's most powerful policymakers gather for the annual Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) to plot the economic direction and strategies for Chinese President Xi Jinping's second five-year term.Obviously, the central government wants to defuse the financial risks fuelled by wild credit expansion in the past years, but they are also aware, and are being told by banks, that haste will backfireDexu, economics professor with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Obviously, the central government wants to defuse the financial risks fuelled by wild credit expansion in the past years, but they are also aware, and are being told by banks, that haste will backfire. It certainly needs cautious and nimble policies to achieve the goal,” said He Dexu, an economics professor with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">, China's top think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao Yang, chief China economist at Nomura, said that as the Chinese authorities push forward deleveraging and global central banks tighten their belts, further tightening in policy and liquidity will cause widening credit spread, diverged stock performance and surging risk premiums on the China market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors will see greater distinctions among good and bad companies, healthy and unhealthy banks, also industries relying or not relying on investment,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong, said it would be unwise to overlook the downside risks of infrastructure investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our impression as economists is that while the consensus used to be overly pessimistic towards China, now it is starting to turn a bit too optimistic,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Infrastructure spending had been used as the main tool by the government to set a stable economic backdrop for the leadership reshuffle during the 19th party congress in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/15/7248fc84-e180-11e7-af98-bc68401a7f65_image_hires_215022.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now as President Xi has consolidated his power, and is poised to lead the country to embrace “high-quality” growth, “policymakers might be able to accept slower growth for infrastructure spending from next year, as the growth in the past five years is unsustainable”, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“High-quality” growth is a growth pattern aligned more towards structural improvement rather than numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's housing market cools in January as policy tightening measures take effect[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2067876/chinas-housing-market-cools-january-policy-tightening-measures-take-effect]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists and analysts also differ on their views on the outlook for the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has seen a deep imbalance in the economy and high level of debt, both building up so quickly that has been “never seen anywhere else”, Peking University professor Michael Pettis told the Fortune China forum held in Guangzhou earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But unlike other countries where gross domestic product tracks the output of the economy, China's GDP is an input by the government to achieve the goals made in advance by taking on as much debt as possible, which is unsustainable, he argued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsinghua professor David Li Daokui disputes that. Li, who is also a former central bank adviser, said China's savings rate is two to three times that of the US and thus the debt level is way from scary, and the country still has great room for growth and stability as it is still busy building infrastructure, opening up its market while at the same time maintaining certain capital flow controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the GDP growth target made by Beijing for 2017 (around 6.5 per cent) is on track to be achieved - as the economy registered a growth rate at 6.9 per cent in the first three quarters, and is set to end the year at 6.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/15/71d9382c-e180-11e7-af98-bc68401a7f65_image_hires_215022.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economic policies that China will adopt in 2018</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, hundreds of top policymakers, regulators and provincial governors will meet in Beijing for the annual CEWC to discuss major economic tasks and policies, and most importantly, set the GDP growth target.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The growth target for 2018 could be announced by the CEWC, but it is likely to be flexible between 6 to 6.5 per cent, as more structural reforms, more policies to tackle pollution and income distribution problems put short-term pressure on growth,” said Nomura's Zhao, who projected around 6.4 per cent growth for 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IMF raises forecast for world economic growth in 2017 and 2018[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2114801/imf-raises-forecast-world-economic-growth-2017-and-2018]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> had revised China's GDP growth rate from 6.4 to 6.5 per cent in 2018, in its World Economic Outlook issued in late October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three key tasks for next year will include “addressing key risks and control macro leverage ratio, poverty reduction and significantly cut pollution emissions and improve the environment”, </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> reported after a Politburo meeting held on December 8.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The coming year will see China shift its priority to financial deleveraging and environmental protection from reducing industrial capacity and managing the housing market, as the last two sectors have been somewhat restored to health, said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia analyst at AXA Investment Managers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/15/71662ec2-e180-11e7-af98-bc68401a7f65_image_hires_215022.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Concerns about an overheating housing market have abated after the authorities rolled out measures to stop prices from spiralling out of control and with steel-capacity elimination achieving 76 per cent of its five-year target, an easing off on the de-capacity campaign would be understandable,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the official rhetoric and policy actions are becoming increasingly forceful on financial deleveraging and environment protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial draft rules introduced by regulators in November, which are now being resisted by banks, is a major ongoing mission aimed at mitigating a growing systemic risk to China's financial sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regards to environmental clean-up, authorities are closing down factories and turning off coal-fired boilers. Starting next year, local governors will face audits of their records on natural resource management and environmental protection, and be held accountable for damages even after they leave the position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Growth will decelerate in 2018, while policy operations will be bumpier as the authorities try to strike a balance between reforms and short-term stability, said Yao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If, and when, the two - reforms and stability preservation - are in conflict, we think the latter will take priority. Aggressive rate rises [due to deleveraging] and sharply cooling housing market [due to official tightening] will be duly countered by policy mitigation if they are seen as posing threats to macro stability,” he wrote in a note this week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The vice-chairman of Hong Kong centrist political party Third Side was refused entry to Macau on the eve of the anniversary of the former Portuguese enclave's handover to Chinese rule.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Casper Wong Chun-long, who was travelling with five business partners on Tuesday morning to attend a fintech forum at the casino hub, was stopped on arrival by immigration officers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His business partners were let through, but Wong was taken to a room for questioning and was eventually turned away on grounds, according to a document presented to him, that “there are strong references that you intend to enter [Macau] to participate in certain activities which may jeopardise the public security or public order of [Macau}”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong, who last visited the city in September, said he was puzzled by the Macau authorities' decision, as Third Side was a moderate political party that supported Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor during the Hong Kong chief executive election in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking to the press at the ferry terminal on his return to Hong Kong, Wong said: “I and Third Side walk the middle of the road. If we are regarded as someone or a group that could cause a threat to the government, we doubt if the central government or the Macau government is sincere when it says it wants to keep contact with groups with different political views.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Third Side was co-founded by former Democratic Party legislator Tik Chi-yuen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong, a former student activist, said he suspected the Macau government had tightened up immigration control as the city was to celebrate its 18th handover anniversary on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tik said Macau's denial of Wong's entry for a business conference made a mockery of Beijing's push for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area development promoting closer cooperation between the three locations in terms of people flow, logistics, transport and capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the party had raised the issue with the Hong Kong Security Bureau and demanded an explanation from the Macau authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Macau government could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Security Bureau said in a statement that it would not comment on individual cases and added: “We must respect the right of other jurisdictions in exercising immigration control … We will not, and should not, interfere.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent months, numerous Hong Kong opposition lawmakers have been barred from entering Macau, ostensibly over the same security concerns. They include the Democratic Party's Helena Wong Pik-wan and Andrew Wan Siu-kin, the Civic Party's Dr Kwok Ka-ki, Raymond Chan Chi-chuen of People's Power, and Kenneth Leung, who is non-affiliated.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A continued stronger yuan against the US dollar should reduce the number of mainland investors still rushing to snap up Hong Kong stocks, to hedge against any future weakening in the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it certainly won't stop the southbound capital flows still being experienced by the Hong Kong-Shanghai-Shenzhen Stock Connect trading system, top officials at </span><span class="s3">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> said in their latest regional market update on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The recent strengthening of the yuan and weakening of the dollar may slow the southbound capital flow, as mainlanders feel less of a need to hedge against a possible decline in the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But I don't think we will see any reverse in the tide of capital flow southward this year,” said Tai Hui, the investment giant's chief market strategist for Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides hedging [against] the yuan, mainlanders still like to invest in Hong Kong stocks to diversify their portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are limited investment choices in the mainland and there are increasing policies [being put] in place to discourage them from investing in property, while the fixed income market is complicated for retail investors,” said Hui.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is the most convenient market for them to invest. As such, I see southbound capital inflow to Hong Kong slowing a bit, but not dropping substantially.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's 6.5 per cent weakening against the greenback in 2016 sparked many mainlanders to plough into Hong Kong stocks, property and insurance policies to hedge the risks, as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland buying of Hong Kong stocks via the two Stock Connects with Hong Kong (Shanghai and Shenzhen) doubled last year, with their trading representing six per cent of total market turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan, however, rose to a four-month high on Tuesday to around 6.5 to the dollar, after gaining 6.8 per cent on its US rival over the full year - the biggest gain in nine years which wiped out the losses of 2016 and reversed three straight years of depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Hui believes the Chinese currency will continue to strengthen this year as Beijing strives towards its ultimate goal of gaining its full international use.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That expectation by Beijing inched ever close on Wednesday when Pakistan confirmed it is hoping to boost trade and economic ties with China, by trading with the country in yuan, the </span><span class="s3">State Bank of Pakistan</span><span class="s1"> in Karachi said. Imports, exports and financial transactions between the two countries can now be denominated in the yuan.Besides hedging [against] the yuan, mainlanders still like to invest in Hong Kong stocks to diversify their portfolio. There are limited investment choices in the mainland and there are increasing policies [being put] in place to discourage them from investing in propertyTai Hui, the investment giant's chief market strategist for Asia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulatory frameworks such as the opening of letters of credit, clearing of transactions and financing facilities in yuan have been put in place, it said, adding the move has put the yuan on a par with other international currencies such as the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ayaz Ebrahim, co-head of the Asia Pacific regional team at </span><span class="s3">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span><span class="s1">, added the firm also holds a positive market outlook for Asia, particularly Hong Kong, China, India and South Korea, but that to expect some volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market rallies in Asian stock markets in 2017 were supported by strong corporate earnings growth. We expect this to continue in 2018 across different sectors, with e-commerce in China and fintech development in India leading the growth trend,” Ebrahim said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, he believes H-shares - listed companies incorporated in mainland China that are traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange [A-shares refer to those listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen] - would continue to grow well, especially given the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">'s recent announcement of a pilot project on “full circulation” of selected H-share listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“H-shares are still the easiest way for international investors who want to invest in the China story as not all A-shares are allowed to be traded by international investors,” Ebrahim said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As we are positive on the Chinese economic outlook, we are also positive on H-shares.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What could go wrong, is if the US increases interest rates more aggressively than we expect. The Chinese government may also tighten regulation on shadow banking, which may slow the economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regionally, Hui said wider Asian markets may be more volatile this year, predicting a worst-case scenario of a 15-17 per cent fall, compared with 4 per cent drop last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors should adopt a combination of styles to capture growth while maintaining downside protection,” he said, recommending they look at consumption, health care and technology stocks for growth, while buying high-dividend paying stocks for defensive approach.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange watchdog has denied on Thursday that Beijing was considering suspending or slowing down its purchase of US Treasuries, refuting a news report the previous day which has weighed on </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> bonds and the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg cited unnamed sources on Wednesday as saying that Chinese officials were reviewing the country's US$3.1 trillion in foreign exchange holdings, and had recommended halting or slowing purchases of </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> bonds due to the declining attractiveness of the asset and rising US-China trade tensions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report sent 10-year </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> yields to a 10-month high of 2.59 per cent and the dollar index lower to 92.3 on Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) said on Thursday that the Bloomberg report had “cited a wrong source, or could be fake news”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China has been diversifying its forex reserves investments and its investments in US Treasuries is market-driven,” SAFE said on its website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whether it was fake news or not, analysts said the drama could be Beijing's political tactic to temper Trump's protectionist intentions and manage the scale of future trade disputes. The probability for a significant portfolio change in China's foreign reserve account was unlikely, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It could be an intentional leak to warn the Trump Administration that China has some levers to pull in responding to any punitive protectionist measures on trade,” said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump ‘may be ready to press' the punitive China tariff button[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2127819/trump-may-be-ready-press-punitive-china-tariff-button]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said there were two factors that could have any bearing on China to slow its purchase of US debt. One was global investors are bearish on the asset “as the Fed is starting to unwind balance sheet and tax reforms are spurring growth and inflation”, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other was China may “no longer need to hold as much reserves as before” as the country is likely to further liberalise its capital account in 2018, amid the current level of comfort with its currency movement and capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In reality, Yao said Beijing did not have much of a choice but to continue to allocate a large portion of its reserves in US bonds, given the market's strength in “liquidity and depth”.It could be an intentional leak to warn the Trump Administration that China has some levers to pull in responding to any punitive protectionist measures on tradeAidan Yao, AXA Investment Managers Asia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ING Bank Greater China economist Iris Pang said it would be no surprise if China wanted to revise its foreign reserves portfolio when global investors started to walk away from US Treasuries whose issuance cost could increase after the tax cut in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But China is the largest buyer [of US Treasuries], what it says will deeply influence investors' sentiments. So it could be used as a “one stone killing two birds”, which provides the Trump administration with pressure on both the markets and trade fronts,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US administration is considering several new tariffs in the coming weeks, including broad restrictions on steel and aluminium imports and punitive actions against China arising from an investigation into Beijing's intellectual property practice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past two weeks, two of China's star companies, Ant Financial and Huawei, have met setbacks in the US market where their investments were being obstructed, triggering a wave of mainland Chinese state media criticisms against the </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> for its “protectionism”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government is taking a cautious approach as it plans to review its mortgage policy for first-time buyers, according to James Lau, the secretary for financial services and the treasury - but any such move must be carefully thought out not to add further fuel to what is an already overheating property market in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking on the sidelines of the Asia Financial Forum being held in the city, Lau said it should be the right of every Hong Kong citizen to own their own home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Equally, the government needs to be very cautious in launching any mortgage policy aimed at helping youngsters or any other members of the public to buy their own home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to ensure any new policy simply doesn't make it easier for speculators to re-stimulate the property market further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Let me make it quite clear - any potential changes to the mortgage policy would be aimed solely at helping first-home buyers. And it does not mean the government has any intention of relaxing any of the many policies introduced to curb property prices,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His remarks came after Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po last week told lawmakers that the government-owned </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation</span><span class="s1"> was considering new policies to help youngsters or first-time homebuyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKMC is now considering offering mortgage insurance to help people who do not have enough money to pay 30 per cent of the value as the initial down payment, meaning they can get 90 per cent mortgages. Again, Lau said HKMC would consider this cautiously.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said any such relaxations need to be made “at the right time” while giving no further details on how such a system might work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau said besides mortgage policies, the government was also working hard to increase the supply of land to be released to developers on which to build new properties, aimed at lower-end buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong's largest developer by market value, last week called on the corporation to ease its lending scheme for mass-market flats.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun Hung Kai Properties calls for relaxed mortgage lending for mass market flats[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/2127691/sun-hung-kai-properties-calls-relaxed-mortgage-lending-mass]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, the average price of a new flat rose 16.9 per cent to HK$12.57 million each from 2016, according to Ricacorp Properties. The price for used flats grew slower, at about 13 per cent in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will work hard to meet the demands of the public in helping them buy their own home. But as mentioned, we have to make sure these measures don't in any way help speculators from inflating prices,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As shares in Hong Kong reached record highs on Monday, Lau said the stock market was robust, representing strong economic momentum worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> is positive about the economic outlook globally in 2018. The US's monetary policy also affects capital flow. The Hong Kong stock market is rising along with this momentum,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Lau underlined the government's strong stance, however, that it does now accept the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s suggestion of changing or scrapping stock stamp duties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Stock stamp duty is an important source of government income. The government has no intention to change it,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, the largest creditor of the </span><span class="s3">United States government</span><span class="s1">, has a tool in its policy arsenal to retaliate against any punitive trade measures imposed by Donald Trump's administration, although the option should be exercised with caution, said a prominent Chinese economist who used to sit on the central bank's monetary policy advisory committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The comment by Yu Yongding, director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics, and member of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> committee that sets monetary policy, joins a rising chorus of voices within China's circle of policymakers to pare back on the country's US$1.71 trillion in US Treasuries, the largest hoard in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some people said reducing China's holdings of US Treasuries [can be an effective retaliation against] the trade war started by Trump,” Yu said during a financial forum in Beijing. “ While I think it would be a double-edged sword which should be carefully used, I agree that China's hoard of US Treasuries is too high and should be reduced gradually.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's economy has transformed since the country's 2001 membership in the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1"> into the world's factory. The economy exports more than it imports, running up large trade surpluses against major trading partners that come back to the country in US dollars as foreign exchange reserves. China had the world's biggest foreign reserves of about US$3.1 trillion as of December, which rose slightly in 2017 because of a 6.7 per cent appreciation of the Chinese currency.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All the foreign exchange earned from exports need to be invested, and US Treasuries offer the most liquid and secure investments for dollar-denominated assets on earth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The holdings have ballooned, along with China's economic growth and its rising exchange reserves, to a peak of US$1.3 trillion in 2013. Since then, the Chinese government - advised by the central bank monetary policy committee which Yu sat on - had been reducing its purchases of </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> issues to diversify its exposure to dollar assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/25/de3f0ae8-01a4-11e8-b181-443655c1d2b1_image_hires_203028.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reduction had to be gradual because China's government cannot dump its holdings in one fell swoop without depressing prices and turning around to hurt itself, the result of demand and supply which Yu referred to as the “double-edged sword.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's holdings of US bonds, notes and bills fell in November by 1.1 per cent to a four-month low of US$1.18 trillion, according to the </span><span class="s3">US Treasury Department</span><span class="s1">'s January 17 data, the second monthly drop in three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's creditor status to the US and the large trade surplus it runs up against America had been a subject of friction, and harsh rhetoric on the campaign trail during Trump's run for presidency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week, his administration imposed import tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. While the tax on washing machines, instigated by </span><span class="s3">Whirlpool</span><span class="s1">, have South Korea's </span><span class="s3">LG</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1"> in their sights, the import duties are likely to hurt Chinese manufacturers, the world's biggest exporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Quotas and punitive duties could also be imposed on other products including steel and aluminium, pending the outcome of investigations by the US Trade Representative's office. The </span><span class="s3">US Congress</span><span class="s1"> is also working to expand coverage of national security to strengthen investment screening of foreign companies, especially from China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The old logic of shoring up foreign reserves and using it to back the renminbi when it is under depreciation is a waste of foreign exchange,” Yu said. “Based on effective curbs on cross-border capital flow, it is sufficient for China to have US$1 trillion in foreign reserves, or even lower than that.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A range of policy tools are available to China for responding to trade confrontation, Yu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China could decrease our trade surplus, or say, our dependence on the US” as a major export market, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose for the 12th consecutive month on the back of a weakening dollar and tough capital controls, according to official data released on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves grew US$21.5 billion in January to hit US$3.16 trillion, the highest since October 2016, </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> figures showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The monthly growth in January, which was bigger than an increase of US$20.2 billion in December, came amid China's strict capital account controls and a strengthening yuan, which is at its highest level against the US dollar since August 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China does not face much pressure from capital outflow for now,” said Hong Hao , chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bocom International Holdings</span><span class="s1"> . “Pretty much all the loopholes in the capital control scheme have been plugged.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex new year resolution: hit illegal currency outflows hard in 2018 [http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2132140/chinas-forex-new-year-resolution-hit-illegal-currency-outflows]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has introduced a series of capital control policies in the past two years, including tighter scrutiny of individual purchases of insurance plans abroad and of overseas asset acquisitions by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government was unlikely to relax its grip, Hong said, because the measures were a key reason the foreign exchange reserves had stabilised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is long-term demand driving capital outflow because as China's economy matures, people want to diversify their asset portfolios and buy overseas assets,” said Claire Huang, a China economist at Societe Generale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement that the reserves rose in January thanks to appreciation of non-dollar currencies in the portfolio, and China would see “more balanced” cross-border capital flows in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, the central bank reiterated its determination to “prevent cross-border capital flow risks” and “clamp down harshly on foreign currency crimes”, including underground banks helping Chinese move their money overseas, in a statement following its 2018 working meeting.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing regards capital outflow as a major threat to economic and financial stability after China lost about US$1 trillion in its foreign exchange reserves from mid-2014 to early 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese individuals can purchase US$50,000 worth of foreign currency each year, an annual quota that was renewed on January 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang noted that US dollar-denominated forex reserves may have been inflated by the weakened dollar because it pushed up the US dollar value of euro and yen assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The valuation effect played a large role in the rise of forex reserves this year,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the yuan strengthening more than 5 per cent against the US dollar in the past three months, the government was unlikely to lend support to lift the currency any further, Hong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a delicate balance - neither too much appreciation or depreciation is good for China's economy,” Hong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An even stronger yuan would hurt Chinese exports and raise the costs of its economic structural reform, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forex reserves rose for the whole year in 2017, the first time since 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's move to quadruple the daily quotas for the stock connect schemes linking mainland and Hong Kong markets is aimed at addressing a potential surge in capital flows when yuan-denominated equities are included in the MSCI index, according to </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global stock index provider will include 222 Chinese A shares in its MSCI Emerging Markets Index, using a two-step process beginning on June 1. The inclusion comes amid rising US-China trade tensions that have hurt the performance of Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Trade war risks worries are hurting the stock markets in the short term. However, the process of diversifying away from RMB-denominated assets by Chinese investors had just started and should continue for a long time,” said Steven Sun, head of research, HSBC Qianhai Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting today, mainland investors are able to trade up to 42 billion yuan (US$6.6 billion) in Hong Kong stocks, up from 10.5 billion yuan previously, while investors in Hong Kong can trade up to 52 billion yuan worth of stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, up from 13 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Actual transactions, however, only accounted for about a quarter of the previous daily quota. In April, daily northbound flows into A-shares totalled about 2.7 billion yuan, which represented a sharp increase from the 600 million yuan to 700 million yuan recorded in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Sun estimated that the MSCI inclusion will draw some US$2 billion of inflows from passive and active managers from June 1, before rising to US$24 billion over time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Foreign investors' understanding of China's regulatory environment will increase and Chinese regulations will also converge with international standards. This will lead to more Chinese stocks being included in the MSCI,” Sun said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> has forecast the Shanghai Composite Index to end the year up by 12 per cent to 3,500, the Shenzhen Component Index up by 18 per cent to 12,500, and the CSI 300 to reach 4,300, reflecting gains by mid-cap companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank is also positive about the food and beverage, innovative medicine, IT hardware and online gaming sectors. It is predicting positive outlook for Chongqing Beer, Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceutical, Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine, </span><span class="s3">Accelink Technologies</span><span class="s1"> and online gaming developer Perfect World.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the more immediate term, Hong Kong's stocks and Chinese domestic shares are likely to face growing pressure if China and the US, whose trade delegation is in Beijing this week, fail to resolve the dispute through negotiations, or that both sides leave little room for compromise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland media reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, vice-premier Liu He, will meet the delegation on Thursday and Friday to “exchange views” on issues of mutual concern relating to bilateral trade and business ties. US President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on up to US$150 billion worth of Chinese goods, in an attempt to force changes in China's trade practices and to accelerate the opening up of its economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and mainland stock markets had also faced headwinds ahead of more interest rate hikes by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> this year, analysts said, especially given the vulnerability of US equities which have been trading near historically high levels. In addition, Chinese companies' first-quarter profit growth slowed to 12 per cent, compared with the year-earlier period's 15 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Markets are worried about future inflation caused by high commodity prices. This is strengthening expectation of further interest rate hikes by the Fed,” said Angus To, analyst at Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China International.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing will not use a sharply devalued yuan as a weapon to gain an upper hand in its trade war with the US, as it will do more bad than good to China's economy and hurt its image as an upholder of free trade, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past month China's yuan has swung from being one of the stronger global currencies to an underperformer, suffering a 3.3 per cent depreciation against the US dollar, reflecting its worst single-month decline since Beijing established its foreign exchange market in 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese officials have been careful to stress there is no official policy to devalue its currency as part of a salvo in the ongoing trade battle with the US, arguing instead that market forces have been the major driver in the yuan's softening.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the central bank, said in a recent statement that the yuan's drop is likely only temporary as China's economic fundamental point to a stronger currency in the longer term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no possibility of significant depreciation,” Guo said in an interview on Thursday with the state-run media group Financial News, a publication affiliated with the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">. He added that the yuan would likely tend to be stronger in the future.There is no possibility of significant depreciationGuo Shuqing, party secretary of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In recent years, some international punters have tried to earn big profits by shorting the yuan. The facts proved they had made serious misjudgment over the situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo was the latest senior official to provide reassurance from Beijing that the yuan would not depreciate drastically.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PBOC governor Yi Gang and China's foreign exchange administrator Pan Gongsheng made similar statements on repeated occasions in the past week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan and its offshore counterpart traded in Hong Kong both rebounded against the US dollar on Friday afternoon, as US tariffs on Chinese imports came into effect.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's Ministry of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> said on Friday that it would take its case to the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government sources told the Post that Beijing has not adopted a weak yuan policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the trade war with the US, there were suggestions that China should allow the yuan to devalue moderately to offset impacts from Trump's tariffs … but the Ministry of Commerce has long lost its decision-making power over the yuan, although it still has the influence,” a source within the Ministry of Commerce said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, which is the primary agency overseeing the yuan exchange rate, does not want to see a rapid depreciation, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, China would prefer a stable currency to help facilitate internal reform and economic transformation, in addition to stable relationships with the Eurozone, Japan and emerging economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Net exports contributed only 0.7 percentage points to the overall growth made by the Chinese economy last year. Its contribution is largely dwarfed by domestic consumption and investment,” said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's priority is on stabilising internal conditions with proper monetary and fiscal policies, he said, adding that a currency war would cause regional or even global capital flow turmoil.A significant devaluation against the US dollar is highly likely to trigger yuan depreciation against other major currencies - the beggar thy neighbour game will put everyone in a turbulent situationAidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers Asia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A significant devaluation against the US dollar is highly likely to trigger yuan depreciation against other major currencies - the beggar thy neighbour game will put everyone in a turbulent situation. It will go in conflict with China's image as a defender of globalisation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen Jianguang, an economist with Mizuho Securities Asia argued that the exchange rate was becoming less relevant in determining the flow of global exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Exports are more closely related to real external demand and tariff policies rather than limited changes in exchange rates,” he wrote in a research note on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan appreciated by over 6 per cent against the US dollar in 2017, while exports rebounded 10.8 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan continuously weakened during a two-year period starting in 2014 when global exports remained sluggish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen also said a significantly weaker currency would not only undermine China's domestic purchasing power and consumer sentiment, but also pose significant risk to China's inflated property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Moreover, large currency depreciation could cause domestic panic, trigger capital flight and negate the previous efforts of the Chinese government to stabilise the exchange rate and promote the internationalisation of yuan,” Shen said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China orchestrated a 2 per cent depreciation in the yuan on August 11, 2015, a sign that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was giving the market more say in determining the currency's daily mid price fixing, as Beijing was trying to join an elite reserve basket under the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What followed was a sharp sell of the yuan that drained China's foreign exchange reserve by US$1 trillion, as officials fought to calm the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China must have leaned their lesson when seeing investors' anxiety and significant capital outflow and capital market jitters. This is not a can of worms that Beijing wants to open again,” said Iris Pang, economist for Greater China at </span><span class="s3">ING Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not think a currency war is making any sense for any country. Sharp currency depreciations in the past few years, like the krona depreciation when Iceland went bankrupt after the global financial crisis, are all driven by the market, but not by the government,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's commerce minister is planning to launch an all-out defence of the city's case against the China-US trade war in an official visit to Washington, vowing to speak out about the United States behaving like “a captain getting ready to abandon ship” in global trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an exclusive interview with the Post, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah said he had noticed Hong Kong's business leaders were worried about the unfolding trade war, as it was creating uncertainty and driving up the cost of business, especially for the import and export sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trade spat[https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war] was also casting a shadow over capital flow, currency exchanges and investment sentiment, he said, highlighting the city's vulnerable status even though it has managed to avoid the full impact so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An impassioned Yau pledged to do right by businesses, saying the government would continue to monitor the situation, and roll out measures to support local firms when necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also promised that the city's leadership would continue to adopt a multipronged strategy to safeguard Hong Kong's status as an international trading hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no winner in the trade war ... because somebody has to pick up these [extra] costs and there is no fixed equation on who is going to pay more,” Yau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following tit-for-tat 25 per cent tariffs on US$34 billion worth of goods on July 6, Washington announced a 10 per cent levy on another US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week, pending congressional approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After meeting with major trade associations on Monday, Yau estimated that with the second round of tariffs proposed by Washington, about HK$130 billion worth of mainland Chinese exports to the US via Hong Kong - or nearly half of such exports passing through and about 3.5 per cent of the city's total exports - would be affected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tariffs were also likely to directly cost about 0.1 to 0.2 per cent of the city's GDP growth, although the long-term impact remained difficult to estimate at this stage, he added on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his interview with the Post on Thursday, Yau revealed that to deal with the issue, Hong Kong had joined as a third party in several complaints lodged with the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation (WTO) </span><span class="s1">regarding Washington's latest trade moves, and the US was required to respond.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other international platforms such as the </span><span class="s3">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">Apec</span><span class="s1">) had also been helpful, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[The trade war] was initiated by the US … we cannot have a meaningful discussion [on improving the </span><span class="s3">WTO</span><span class="s1">] if any one of us behaves like a captain getting ready to abandon ship,” Yau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being on the same boat, the last thing you want is to see it being sunk or abandoned ... This is why Hong Kong is so vocal and worried about the trade war ... We live on free trade and are a living example.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked whether he would be visiting the American capital soon to discuss the issue, Yau said: “I'm planning to do so ... But visiting Washington is not the only way; occasions such as Apec and </span><span class="s3">WTO</span><span class="s1"> meetings [are also opportunities to lobby].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yau will be joining a list of top local officials who have travelled to the US since the current Hong Kong government took office in July last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign business groups in the city, including the </span><span class="s3">American Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong, have warned of parties in the US who argue it is “no longer constructive to discern where the mainland ends and Hong Kong begins” on the issue of trade, meaning the city can be pulled into the centre of the dispute.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Yau said he was not worried about the trend, as he believed most American business leaders were still aware of Hong Kong's unique strengths under the “one country, two systems” principle in which Beijing guaranteed the city a “high degree of autonomy” after it was returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's hard for me to say that in the future, Hong Kong will be considered equal to the mainland,” Yau said. “But no matter how [America sees the city, tariff measures] damage Hong Kong-US business interests.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far, Hong Kong has only been named once in the punitive tariffs on steel and aluminium products the US levied on the city and mainland China earlier this year, on grounds of protecting national security.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To counter the tariff measures, Yau said, two funds worth HK$2.5 billion catering to smaller firms were ready for applicants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of them was a HK$1.5 billion fund to help Hong Kong companies upgrade and restructure their business operations and market products in mainland China - it would be extended to the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1"> (Asean) on August 1, Yau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 10-nation trading bloc, comprising Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, is Hong Kong's second-largest trade partner after mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Export Credit Insurance Corporation has also helped with extra coverage for exporters by increasing the number of buyers subject to free assessment of risks to six per Hong Kong exporter from three.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have other funding schemes ready for companies which may become cash strapped as a result,” Yau said. “There are umbrellas ready for the rainy days.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese stocks officially sank into bear territory last month as domestic investors dumped their equities in the world's worst-performing market and looked for opportunities overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One innovative company is seizing the opportunity to help them invest in stock markets abroad. And it does not even have to worry about China's notoriously tricky capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Futu Securities, which already runs mainland China's biggest mobile stock-trading app, enables Chinese people to buy and sell Hong Kong and US-listed shares using the money they already have parked in overseas banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People always talk about capital controls in China. But they tend to ignore the fact that after years of development and accumulation, the wealth owned by Chinese people overseas is already huge,” said Dennis Wu, CEO of Futu Securities during an interview on Wednesday in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We help mainlanders trade stocks offshore, as long as they have their bank accounts and capital offshore already,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Futu, more than 30 per cent owned by the internet giant Tencent, is an app that integrates trading, information aggregation, and social networking.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, founded in 2013, obtained a licence for trading US stocks in late December and is now building up a local team there. It plans to launch a bilingual app soon, targeting Chinese people looking to trade shares in mainland China, Hong Kong, and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will find itself in direct competition with American peers like Robinhood, a commission-free broker based in California.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total assets on the Futu platform, mainly cash and stocks, have surpassed HK$10 billion (US$1.3 billion), 95 per cent of which is held in overseas bank accounts, Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its more established market of Hong Kong, daily trade on the Futu app now accounted for 1 per cent of the total stock market turnover, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the recent initial public offering of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, about a fifth of the retail investors subscribed via the app, contributing 13 per cent of the total capital invested by individuals.People always talk about capital control in China. But they tend to ignore the fact that after years of development and accumulation, the wealth owned by Chinese people overseas is already hugeDennis Wu, CEO, Futu Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm is able to avoid the headwinds brought about by the occasional tightening and loosening of capital-flow restrictions by China's foreign-exchange authority, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu's company closed a third round of fundraising, worth US$145 million in June 2017, which valued it at above US$1 billion with 380,000 accounts opened and five million app users. The average amount stored in an account stands above HK$100,000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu did not disclose specific valuation and revenue figures for Futu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese internet giant Tencent led all three rounds of fundraising, and now holds more than 30 per cent of Futu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By comparison, Robinhood completed its latest round of fundraising in May, which valued the firm at US$5.6 billion. It has 4 million accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other key investors include </span><span class="s3">Matrix Partners</span><span class="s1"> China and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu said the firm had not yet reached the financial requirements for an IPO in Hong Kong. But, backed by fast growth in its business, it could be ready as soon as next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Futu's user, account and turnover numbers have been growing by three to five times annually since 2014, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This rapid expansion has triggered concern among peers in the Hong Kong market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What Futu does is “aggressive” and is pushing regulatory boundaries, said Jojo Choy, vice-chairman of National Resources Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They will change the way that brokerages make money. Traditionally we rely on commission and margin financing. But with their massive number of users and trading activities, Futu will get big data that could breed new business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will force local brokerages to find new ways to retain clients.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The private wealth of Chinese citizens is swelling at the fastest pace in history. Although Beijing has tightened its control of capital outflow in recent years, many rich people had already parked a considerable proportion of their wealth overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A McKinsey report issued in May estimated that 10 per cent of the wealth of China's high-net-worth individuals is now kept offshore. McKinsey expected the private wealth of Chinese citizens to reach 158 trillion yuan by 2021, with more than 56 per cent of that accumulated in the form of non-cash assets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should be prepared for a new round of capital outflows and currency depreciation when bracing for the impact of the trade war with the US and other disturbances to the financial markets, a prominent economist warned on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu Yongding, a senior researcher with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"> and a former adviser to the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said “some disturbing factors” had emerged in the Chinese financial markets, such as the wave of peer-to-peer lending defaults or concerns about a property bubble and an economic slowdown in the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trade war with the US will have a negative impact on China's economy and market sentiment, as will the impact of interest rate increases in the US and the financial crisis in emerging markets, Yu told a financial forum in northeastern province of Heilongjiang. A link to the transcript was posted on the forum's official website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also warned of the risks of the plunging Turkish lira after US President Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminium tariffs on Turkey[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2159259/turkish-currency-craters-donald-trump-threatens-new-tariffs] amid ongoing political tensions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lira, which fell 16 per cent against the US dollar on Friday, also took its toll on the European financial markets, weakening the euro and rouble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There have been discussions among investment bankers whether there would be a repeat of the Asian Financial Crisis. The so-called herd effect [like that] in the [1997] Asian financial crisis may affect China,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking those factors together, Yu warned that the yuan exchange rate “would face downward pressure which may reinforce the depreciation expectations”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think maybe we should be prepared for a new round of capital outflow and yuan deprecation. This may not happen, but we should prevent the problems before they happen,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saturday marked the third anniversary of the central bank's decision to allow freer fluctuation of the yuan against the US dollar and other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank engineered a depreciation of 2 per cent in consecutive three days starting on August 11, 2015, but insufficient communications with the market players triggered panic and led to continuous capital outflows amid fears of an economic slowdown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu suggest the authorities check “carefully” any possible channels or loopholes for huge capital outflows and also prevent digital currencies from being leveraged as a new tool for the capital exodus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government has done quite well and is very sophisticated in managing cross-border capital flow,” said Yu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy report on Friday that China would not use currency devaluation as a defensive weapon to counter the turmoil of the US trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank also warned that the trade war would hit exports and possibly market sentiment and could exacerbate turbulence in the financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan depreciated 5.0 per cent against the US dollar in the second quarter, reversing a strengthening of 3.9 per cent in the first three months, the central bank said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the ongoing trade tensions and slower economic growth, the Chinese currency has continued to test the key 7.0 level against the US dollar since last month when it saw a strong wave of depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week the central bank moved to raise the costs of foreign exchange speculation to prevent the yuan's further sliding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Yu said it was “irrational that everyone is obsessed with a particular number” and said there was no difference whether the dollar exchange rate was 7 or 6.9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It seems the central bank could send a signal to the market that it is not its goal to defend the yuan above 7 against the dollar” said Yu, who ruled out the likelihood of a massive depreciation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested the People's Bank should improve its communications with the market to appease market sentiment but continue to refrain from regular market intervention.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the last day of August, the Indian government released upbeat gross domestic product (GDP) numbers for the June quarter - 8.2 per cent growth over a year earlier. Since then, though, the news has only been bad. The stock market has fallen every day since, while the rupee has continued its fall, cementing its position as the worst performing Asian currency this year, with a cumulative fall of 12.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The nervousness in the markets, reflecting a broader global bearishness about emerging economies triggered by events in Argentina and Turkey, contrasts with a noticeably more optimistic business mood within the country. This has followed an improved micro story, signalling a revival after a two-year growth slump. Quarterly corporate results for June have been the best in two years, and previously laggard sectors like manufacturing and construction have logged a recovery amid long-awaited signs of a revival in investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GDP numbers underpin the optimism, though they flatter because of a low base. A year earlier, growth had slumped to 5.6 per cent following the widespread disruption of economic activity in the wake of the foolhardy demonetisation of 86 per cent of the currency[https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/2059572/indias-note-ban-what-modi-can-really-achieve] in November 2016. Averaging out the growth for the two years gives a figure of just under 7 per cent - slightly short of the 7.3 per cent trend of the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The key question for the coming months is whether rapid growth is sustainable in the face of the headwinds blowing globally, and which are pushing India's other macroeconomic numbers off balance. When there are contrasting moods on the micro and macro fronts, usually it is the macro story that prevails. The surge in oil prices, by about 50 per cent in the past year to US$77 per barrel, has caused a sharp uptick in the current account deficit to 2.6 per cent of GDP, while higher pump prices and the falling rupee have sent inflation up to 5 per cent - above the monetary authority's target rate of 4 per cent, but within the upper bound of 6 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The price surge prompted the </span><span class="s3">Reserve Bank of India</span><span class="s1"> to jack up policy interest rates in June and again in August, by 25 basis points each time to hit 6.5 per cent, with near-universal expectations of a third increase in October and possibly a fourth in December. This is widely expected to slow consumer purchases in the coming festival season. Growth therefore may come off the boil, though most observers expect it to be better than the 7.1 per cent achieved in the year to March 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">History advises caution. Virtually every surge in global oil prices over the past four decades has sent India's economy, which imports most of its oil and gas (and, increasingly, coal too), into a tailspin: in the oil shocks of 1979, 1991 and 2013 (the exception was 2008). On the first two occasions, the country had to borrow from the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">, while in 2013 it was reckoned as one of the “Fragile Five” economies after the rupee tumbled more than 20 per cent in the space of three months. On the only occasion when the economy coped with record oil prices that crossed US$135 in 2008, strong capital inflows helped counter the increase in the current account deficit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time, though, capital flow has been the other way. While foreign direct investment has continued to come in, and outflows of portfolio money from the equity market have been marginal so far this year, debt outflows have crossed US$7 billion. The Reserve Bank's foreign exchange reserves have dipped in the last four months by about US$25 billion, to US$401 billion. That is still a comfortable level, but for the first time in many years, the reserves are expected to fall during the year because of a balance of payment deficit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The saving grace this time around is that oil prices have not climbed as much as in the past, making the task for the managers of the Indian economy less daunting. The key figure for international investors is the current account deficit. India's is less than half that of Turkey and Argentina (both well over 5 per cent of GDP), and lower than for India in 2013 when the figure had touched 4.9 per cent in the June quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A sharp clampdown to control that deficit caused the economic growth rate to plunge. That is unlikely to be today's scenario.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The worry point today has to be that the country's non-oil merchandise exports have been relatively flat for some years, while imports have grown. In part, that has been because a costly rupee, driven up by strong capital inflows, has tended to price out exporters. For that reason, and also because other emerging market currencies have fallen, the latest fall in the rupee is seen by many as a positive development. The share prices of export-oriented firms in the tech and pharmaceutical sectors reflect such an optimistic outlook, which in turn could mean that economic growth continues to chug along at more than 7 per cent. ■</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is inevitable that a trade war between China and the US will escalate into a new cold war, and the confrontation will press Beijing and Washington to form their own alliances and divide the world into their spheres of influence - a deja vu of the old cold war days when the US and the former Soviet Union vied for global dominance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US is using tariffs as a tool to pressure Beijing to alter its state-led economic model and “unfair” trade practices. At the heart of US policy is the issue of China's state-owned enterprises - they are implementing China's Made in China 2025 strategies, they are the vanguard of expanding Chinese influence in Asia and Africa, and they are the main beneficiaries of technology “transfers” from the US and </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these are exactly the reasons why Beijing will only enhance its state-owned sector - even though doing so could hurt the private economy at home. Meanwhile, those bearing the brunt of a trade war in China are mainly the private exporters, which Beijing cares less about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is also economically much stronger than the former Soviet Union, which may embolden Beijing to engage in a cold war. While the Soviet Union's planned economy model achieved relatively rapid economic growth in the 1960s and early 1970s - the Soviet share in the global economy peaked at 13 per cent in 1970 - the former Communist empire is no match for China's economic might of today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's GDP output is about two-thirds of the US in nominal dollar terms and accounts for approximately 15 per cent of the world economy. China's GDP growth is slowing to a level of around 6.5 per cent but it is still faster than that of the US. More and more people in the US believe China is strong enough to challenge the US-led international system, and so do the elites in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government will find it hard to step back in the trade confrontation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On one hand, giving up a state-owned economy means the ruling Communist Party has to give up the benefits which come from control of the economy. In Taiwan, the </span><span class="s3">Kuomintang</span><span class="s1"> regime, defeated in 1949 by the Communists on the mainland, went on to give up ownership of the economy on the island and quickly lost power. It is a good lesson for the mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Beijing is more willing to stretch the timing of confrontation. Beijing has experienced worse times than the current trade tensions. From the great famine in the early 1960s to a decade of chaos in the Cultural Revolution, and then to international sanctions following the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, these were far worse situations for China than the trade war. So, at least for the ruling elites in Beijing, the attitude may be that if China can overcome those difficulties, why not today's challenges also?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, the US will also find it difficult to compromise because doing so would only give Beijing more confidence in the Chinese model and a willingness to be more aggressive in challenging the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A trade war will firstly spill over to the foreign investment field. China became a net capital exporter in 2014, and China's state-led investment is more easily accepted by developing countries where rule by man is more important than rule of law. The </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> and the US have been strengthening investment restrictions on China since last year, encouraging China to transfer more investment to Asia, Africa and Latin America.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An economic cold war could also weaken the role of the Chinese economy in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The importance of China's market is reflected in two aspects. One is a strong manufacturing capacity thanks to its cheap labour force, and the other one is a big potential consumer market due to rapid economic growth. The former is being replacing by India and Southeast Asia, the latter may be weakened by a zero tariff trade zone of the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">, the US and Japan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China's market becomes less important than before, which in turn would prompt Beijing to further close access for the US and its allies, the world trade market may be divided into two parts. The separation of foreign investment plus trade markets means the separation of capital flow, which will bring monetary and financial confrontation. Russia was looking forward to stopping the US dollar for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The economic exchanges between China and the US are far closer than they were for the two camps in the old cold war. That's why the new trade war will bring more economic damage than ever. Sadly, in every process of national confrontation, rationality always retreats to the second line, for each side believes it will be the winner.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private equity funds, venture capitalists and angel investors are bracing themselves for a harsh winter as China's trade stand-off with the US threatens to bring investment in emerging technology start-ups to a standstill, and drag economic growth back to its slowest pace in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Money raised by Chinese PE funds and VC firms plunged 72 per cent to US$60.2 billion in the first nine months of 2018 from the same period last year, halting five consecutive years of growth, according to the latest data from China Ventures, which compiles data on the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The froth is being squeezed from a bubbly market,” said Zhou Wei, founder and chief executive officer of a fund that mainly invests its US$510 million of capital in early-stage companies in technology, media and telecommunications. “Many smaller funds or start-ups could die.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funding freeze could not have come at a worse time for China's start-ups, which have languished for the past handful of years as banks' least preferred - and in most cases, simply unqualified - borrowers.The froth is being squeezed from a bubbly market. Many smaller funds or start-ups could dieZhou Wei, founder and chief executive officer, China Creation Ventures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That reluctance had provided fertile ground for PE/VC funds to blossom, unleashing billions of dollars of capital for thousands of start-ups that have fundamentally altered the way Chinese consumers shop, travel, read and spend their leisure time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of Chinese-registered PE/VC funds increased eightfold while the amount of capital under management increased fivefold to 8.34 trillion yuan (US$1.2 trillion) by the end of September, from three and half years earlier, according to the Asset Management Association of China, an industry guild.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-up valuations soared so quickly that PE fund managers joked that unicorns were running amok on the streets and hutongs of Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China had 98 “unicorns” - more than a third of the world's full complement - worth more than US$1 billion, according to a report last year[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2110209/who-has-most-unicorns-china-or-us] by Deloitte and China Venture. China was ranked second in the global rankings, just behind the US with its 106 unicorns, and ahead of India's 10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As US President Donald Trump fired the first salvo of his trade offensive with China this year, stock benchmarks declined in Shanghai and Shenzhen, sending the world's second-largest capital market into a tailspin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By November 2 , Shanghai's Composite Index had fallen 20 per cent this year, making it the second-biggest loser out of 94 primary benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg. Only Istanbul's main stock indexes performed worse. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was the 10th-biggest decliner, losing 15 per cent in the same period.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market rout tripped up many companies that had pledged their stocks as collateral for loans, forcing their creditors to sell the equities to cover their margins, resulting in a downward spiral in prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also added to the complexity of exiting through initial public offerings (IPO), further damping the confidence and risk appetite of investors in PE/VCs, said Gu Zhipeng, chief executive officer of JD Capital, an investor in pharmaceuticals and agricultural businesses, whose partners include German heavyweight insurer Allianz and Singapore's </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Even though the government has sent repeated signals of support to the private sector, and the overall policy is headed in the right direction, the actual implementation usually leaves private companies with less bank financing than state-owned enterprises,” Gu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Valuations of start-ups have fallen from their lofty heights as a result, by as much as 50 per cent in some cases, said Jiang Xiaodong, managing partner of Shanghai's Long Hill Capital Management, which invests in high-growth technology and health care. “You need to raise money as quickly as you can in a sustainable way. Everybody needs to work harder and smarter.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gu and other private equity funds will be speaking at the AVCJ Private Equity and Venture forum in Hong Kong from the 13th to the 15th of November.[https://www.avcjforum.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2_iD6du03gIVkKqWCh2OqQTFEAAYASAAEgLxkPD_BwE]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has announced a flurry of fresh measures to ease the funding strain, to restore market and economic confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council said earlier last month that it would support bond financing for private firms, with </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">increasing its re-lending and re-discounting quota by 150 billion yuan, for instance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also last month, 11 domestic securities firms then agreed to plough in 21 billion yuan to participate in a government-backed asset management scheme, which will serve as a de facto bailout fund for listed companies in financial distress - a move aimed at solving an imminent liquidity crisis for firms whose pledged share accounts face blow-up risks as share prices tumble.You need to raise money as quickly as you can in a sustainable way. Everybody needs to work harder and smarterJiang Xiaodong, managing partner of Shanghai's Long Hill Capital Management</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">announced that it would accelerate approvals of second IPO requests, if a firm's first application was rejected, as long as restructuring plans were put in place. The CSRC also said it will encourage private equity funds to buy shares in public companies and participate in any revamps - moves seen as efforts to deepen the reform and liberalisation of China's capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's not enough [any more] to exit only through mergers and acquisition or management buyout,” said Zhou Wei, founder of China Creation Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some PE and VC investors are hoping these latest financial lifelines for private enterprises can also reach start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funding freeze, however, is likely to see the demise of many whose very business models require billions in cash-burn to grow market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It took a mere two years for China's bicycle-sharing industry to peak from a standing start, and then go bust, in the process burning through an estimated US$2 billion in capital. Of the 40 companies that thrived at the industry's height in 2017, three survivors remain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Family funds and amateur investors who lack the financial discipline to discern sound investments from trendy ideas, are likely also to be thumped.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Money may concentrate in stronger and highly specialised funds,” said Creation Venture's founder Zhou. “This creates a healthier market with more exit opportunities for PE and VCs, which can facilitate capital flow within the sector and also encourage new capital to enter the sector.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The CSRC's recent announcement to accelerate IPO approvals also helps alleviate the “exit” issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But whether the support measures can have a lasting impact on the financial market remains to be seen, he added, leaving some VCs with more conservative views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not think we will see any immediate impact on fundraising for PE funds. It is too soon to tell it [the policy] has made it easier for start-ups or private enterprises to raise money,” added Jiang Xiaodong, managing partner of Long Hill Capital, whose venture capital firm invests in high growth Chinese technology and health care companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The trade war is still there, so let's wait and see. It is a tough environment, so everybody needs to work harder and smarter.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou expects weaker funds and start-ups to be “eliminated” as the environment becomes harsher, but he also sees some merits in that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The [entrepreneurial financing] sector was unusually hot for the past three to four years,” he said. “There was much speculative hot money in the sector, and some unqualified entrepreneurs also got some to start their businesses. This actually messed up the sector. Now it's survival of the fittest.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks tumbled the most in more than two weeks on Friday, after a </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> meeting signalling a gradual rate hike prompted worries about capital flow out of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.4 per cent, or 625.8 points, to 25,601.92, the largest daily loss since October 23. The gauge declined 3.3 per cent for the week - the worst performance in a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index declined 2.1 per cent, or 224.75 points, to 10,478.84.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, stocks also trended lower in Shanghai and Shenzhen, recording a five-day losing streak. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.4 per cent to 2,598.97, and the Shenzhen Composite Index shed 0.4 per cent to 1,328.19.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at between 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent on Thursday, fuelling expectations it would approve the fourth rate hike of this year in December.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is worried that capital will flow out of China, because the expected rate hike is likely to further weaken the Chinese yuan,” said Kingston Lin King-ham, director of securities brokerage AMTD.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow pressures are starting to pile up as China's forex reserves fell for the fourth straight month to hit a 18-month low in October, according to data released on Wednesday, driven by an ongoing trade war.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial stocks led the decline in both mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, after China's financial regulator outlined targets for banks to increase lending to private companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private lending will need to make up at least half of the new corporate loans across banks in three years, Guo Shuqing, chief of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said on Thursday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A former top official at </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> says he is optimistic Beijing and Washington can reach a deal by the end of their 90-day trade war truce that will pave the way for future talks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Zhu Min, who was deputy governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> from 2009 to 2010, expected it would take at least six months to a year before the two countries could resolve their trade conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think the 90 days will produce something, but the most important thing is that the deal will pave the way for the future negotiations … for the next six months or 12 months,” Zhu said on Monday at the Understanding China forum in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing and Washington agreed to a three-month ceasefire in their tariffs battle to allow for further talks when Chinese President Xi Jinping met his US counterpart Donald Trump in Argentina on December 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu, now head of the National Institute of Financial Research at </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1">, warned that if the two sides failed to reach a deal within the grace period it would bring disruption to the global economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the US imposes 25 per cent tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese exports to the United States, it will shock the whole world,” said Zhu, who has also served as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will really change the global supply chain and the financial market. The whole world will take it as a really serious signal of decoupling - and of the decline of the global trade system - so I think it's absolutely important for the two countries to reach a deal within the 90 days to avoid the 25 per cent tariffs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the impact of the US-China trade war on the world economy would be fully seen in the coming two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The impact of trade friction on the real economy is still moderate, but on the capital flow and financial market it's huge. But … the full impact on the whole economy and trade will peak in 2020.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu said China was willing to make compromises needed to address some US concerns and to work to reduce the trade imbalance - in particular opening up the service, manufacturing and financial sectors to foreign competition, and reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Continuing to reform SOEs is in China's own interests, it will make domestic competition more fair and equal - that's also important,” he said, adding China would be more transparent in its practice of subsidising state-owned firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he also expressed concern over Washington's rivalry with Beijing in areas beyond trade, and the unpredictability of the US president.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For China, trade is about trade issues. Let's focus on trade, use trade measures to deal with trade friction, and not go beyond trade and expand it to political issues,” Zhu said. “[Also] particularly the US president, Mr Trump, is so unpredictable.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sooner or later, everybody's kingdom must end. And Hong Kong witnessed that in 2018 with the passing of a generation of major business and cultural figures. At their peak, they made Hong Kong the centre of Chinese capitalism - until mainland China emerged. Their passing and what they've left behind will determine Hong Kong's future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The passing of Walter Kwok Ping-sheung[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2169483/hong-kong-property-magnate-walter-kwok-dies-aged-68], former chairman of </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">, marked the end of an era for Hong Kong's original property tycoons. It started with Cheng Yu-tung[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2024071/true-visionary-hong-kong-tycoon-cheng-yu-tung-was-quick-spot], who founded New World Development in 1970, and died in 2016 as Hong Kong's third-richest tycoon. And last year, Li Ka-shing officially retired[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137523/li-ka-shing-calls-it-day-hands-over-reins-son] and relinquished managerial control of </span><span class="s3">CK Hutchison</span><span class="s1">, a conglomerate that had its roots in plastic flowers 50 years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This generation of tycoons practised predatory capitalism over communitarian capitalism, and it is evident in the city's distorted property market, where the government allows developers to sell private flats the size of parking spaces. The property tycoon class has evolved into a threat to the city's stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is only becoming aware that the consequences of laissez-faire policies mean that property is not treated as a strategic public resource for social and economic development, but raw material for private profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But, that generation was also represented by international media and cultural entrepreneurs. Louis Cha Leung-yung[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2170910/hong-kongs-most-famous-martial-arts-writer-louis-cha-dies], aka Jin Yong, the world's most popular Chinese writer, was widely regarded as the most influential Chinese martial arts novelist of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong film producer Raymond Chow Man-wai[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2171469/raymond-chow-man-wai-hong-kong-movie-producer-who-brought], founded Golden Harvest studios in 1970 and introduced Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan to the world. I knew the local banker with Chase Manhattan Bank who convinced his head office to lend Chow money to make his first Bruce Lee movie. Chow took a mortgage on his flat to secure the loan. Hong Kong culture may never recover its historical level of influence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, Hong Kong's young entrepreneurs cannot even afford a flat to pledge for a business. Probably the best business advice of the year came from Canning Fok Kin-ning, group co-managing director of </span><span class="s3">CK Hutchison Holdings</span><span class="s1">, who advised young people to avoid buying overpriced Hong Kong micro flats and invest in their future by moving to and working on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong remains crippled by a cartelised economy in property, retail, utilities and finance. In particular, the Hong Kong property market was like one long mahjong session where, at the end of the game, only several winners surfaced holding all the money. As one tycoon said: “The most important skill needed to succeed in local property is the ability to navigate rapid asset inflation and deflation.” And that seems to be the only speculative skills that Hong Kong business culture has inherited.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may be the freest economy in the world, but it comes at a price[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/hong-kong/article/2163374/when-freedom-takes-some-strange-forms-hong-kong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's biggest problem in capital flow and formation is that, after a prolonged property boom, most of the city's capital resides in the hands of a property class, who are disinterested in other asset classes outside property. In fact, the wealthiest are exiting China and investing abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Silicon Valley, successful tech money tends to reinvest in technology because they are comfortable with those kinds of businesses. Start-up capital for new-economy enterprises continues to be scarce in Hong Kong. It's more plentiful on the mainland, from where, coincidentally, all the intellectual capital and successful new enterprises are currently flowing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A more central issue confronts Hong Kong's traditional owners of capital as China struggles for influence as a superpower. It reaches beyond the shifting tariffs and economics of the current trade war[https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war]. It lies in Karl Marx's description of the central struggle between communism and capitalism: who owns capital? Capitalists believe capital is owned by individuals. Communists believe it must be exclusively possessed by the state. And today, capital includes financial, real and intellectual property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still on ‘To Do' list of ageing Chinese tycoons: picking their successors[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2180732/china-faces-tidal-wave-exits-ageing-tycoons-their-succession]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's form of state capitalism, as the world's second-largest economy, is incompatible with rules-based, Western capitalism. But nowhere is that ideological divide more clear than in Hong Kong, where the tycoons hold most of the city's capital. It poses a problem for them and their heirs, as they feel all their money belongs to their families and not the state.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trying to cling on to its past and freeze policies the way they were has been Hong Kong's fatal delusion since 1997. The archetypal Hong Kong tycoon may never return, because 2018 showed that Beijing may have found a new form of state capitalism that might outperform or survive liberal democracies.</span></p>
