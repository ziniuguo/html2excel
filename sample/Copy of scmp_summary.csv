0,"Star Market, a 'breakthrough in 30-year history of China's stock market', gets off to shining start as all debutants see share prices more than double",Daniel Ren,22 July 2019,"The Shanghai Stock Exchange's new Star Market got off to a suitably stellar start on Monday morning as all 25 debutants saw their share prices at least double.The firms, spanning industries from microchips and biotechnology to artificial intelligence, were greeted by an immediate buying spree as trading opened at 9.30am. They all went on to record gains of at least 100 per cent by 11.30am, the end of the morning session.Anji Microelectronics (Shanghai), a semiconductor manufacturer, got off to the best start, its shares opening 287 per cent higher than the initial public offering price.Trading of Anji had to be suspended for 10 minutes at 10.20am after the stock soared by 404 per cent to 197.6 yuan from its offering price of 39.19 yuan.By lunchtime, the shares were up by 415.4 per cent from their IPO price to close at 202 yuan, making Anji the top gainer among the first 25 companies.Xi'an Bright Laser Technologies recorded the smallest gains, adding 107 per cent to 68.3 yuan.Turnover on the new board was valued at 40 billion yuan on Monday morning, with 62 per cent of shares changing hands.By 10am, trading in eight companies had to be suspended for 10 minutes after they surged 30 per cent from their opening prices.To curb over-speculation in the new market, the Shanghai exchange will halt trading for 10 minutes if a company's stock jumps or falls 30 per cent from its opening price during the first five days of trade. Another 10-minute suspension will be imposed if the rise or fall hits 60 per cent during intraday trading.The new Nasdaq-style board, which debuted on Monday, underscores a profound shift in China's securities sector. But for many retail investors who have lost years of savings on the stock market, the Nasdaq-style board[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3017476/shanghai-stock-exchange-debut-nasdaq-style-market-tech-stocks] also represents an opportunity to recoup some of their money.Hailed as a milestone in the transformation of China's capital markets, Star Market is expected to draw strong buying interest. The 25 companies that debut with the board are perceived as highly profitable and their shares are expected to soar.Everbright Securities had forecast the 25 companies will see their shares surge 29 per cent on average on the first day of trading.But Chen Qun, a retiree and experienced small equities investor, expected them to rise by a higher margin. ""They are going to jump by at least 50 per cent and will continue to rise in the coming week,” said Chen, who has more than 500,000 yuan (US$72,780) invested in mainland China-listed stocks. ""A nearly 30 per cent gain on the first trading day will make them good buys, and I will certainly snap up shares.”About four million qualified retail investors with no less than 500,000 yuan in investment capital have registered to trade shares on the new market, according to China Business News. More than 100 million individual stock traders buy and sell on the regular mainland China bourses.Star Market was ordered into existence by Chinese President Xi Jinping in November last year. It is aimed at helping Beijing sustain economic growth by funding technological innovation rather than through massive infrastructure spending. China's regulators have spent the past eight months preparing the ground for Monday's launch.Star Market presents a new funding platform for Chinese start-ups amid the US-China trade war. Tensions between the world's two largest economies spread to the technology sector in May, when US President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning the use of equipment made by China's Huawei Technologies, the world's largest maker of 5G telecoms equipment.""The launch of the new board is a fresh sign China has shifted its focus from quantity and pace to quality in driving economic growth,” said Yu Peihua, general manager of mutual fund AXA SPDB Investment Managers. ""China is highlighting the role of the capital market in bolstering technology companies, and encouraging them to conduct technological innovation.”The companies debuting on Star Market on Monday are involved in chipmaking, biotechnology, artificial intelligence and new materials - areas in which China wants to develop quickly. As of last week, 148 companies had applied to raise funds on Star Market through initial public offerings.In May, Wu Qing, Shanghai's vice-mayor, said the city was mapping out a strategy called the Shanghai Programme, and would offer tax incentives and funding to key start-ups. The strategy is aimed at helping Chinese companies develop key technologies that might be cut off by US embargoes.""Since it is part of the national strategy to support the companies due to list on the new market, it is certain their prices have huge potential to rise,” said Chen, the small equities investor.She is one of millions who lost savings during a roller-coaster in mainland China's A shares market. In mid-2015, a stock market rout wiped out US$5 trillion in capitalisation in just two months, leaving millions of small players with big losses.Shares tend to surge by at least 30 per cent on debut in mainland China, as investors think they have been underpriced in the bookbuilding process.""Initial trading in stocks listing on the board is likely to be very active, given the high profile of the new market,” said Zhou Ling, a hedge fund manager with Shanghai Shiva Investment. Enthusiasm among investors could threaten Star Market's debut, he added.But the Shanghai exchange has introduced rules to cool any buying frenzy[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3015145/first-tech-company-gets-green-light-price-its-ipo-trading-debut] when trading starts on the board. Companies can trade freely for the first five days and will be subject to a 20 per cent limit from the sixth day of trade.Companies that debut on the regular board are allowed to trade with a 44 per cent daily limit on the first day, and thereafter are allowed to rise or fall by 10 per cent.Meanwhile, the launch of Star Market could also lead to an escalation in competition between exchanges in mainland China and Hong Kong.In April 2018, Hong Kong revamped its IPO rules to attract mainland Chinese firms, allowing companies with dual-class share structures and pre-revenue biotechnology start-ups to go public.With Star Market, Beijing has, for the first time, allowed unprofitable technology companies, including pre-revenue biotechnology start-ups, to list in Shanghai.Foreign-funded mainland Chinese companies using variable interest entities structures have also been welcomed through the issuance of Chinese depositary receipts, ratcheting up pressure on Hong Kong as it looks to regain the crown of the world's top IPO market.Chinese regulators have adopted a new, registration-based IPO mechanism for Star Market. Under the new system, companies are required to fully disclose their earnings and operations in their IPO applications.The Shanghai exchange will assess their documents before green-lighting their IPOs. Most significantly, the regulators will let the market decide the worth of the companies.Over on the main board, the China Securities Regulatory Commission reviews IPO documents to ensure companies can sustain their earnings growth after listings. It also has a final say on the pricing of shares.""The regulators will let market forces play a decisive role in IPOs,” said Wang Xiao, a PwC partner who is also a member of the IPO review committee for Star Market.

1,Nasdaq-style Star Market must show it is more than a casino,SCMP Editorial,28 July 2019,"The euphoria did not last long. The much-advertised new Star Market of the Shanghai Stock Exchange opened to a stellar start with all 25 new shares soaring by an average of 140 per cent. By the second day, all but four of the new listings in China's latest answer to America's Nasdaq fell as investors took flight. The volatility looks set to continue for a while.Collectively, the two dozen firms raised 37 billion yuan (US$5.4 billion). The trillion-dollar question on everyone's minds is: Will the Science and Technology Innovation Board become another casino for China's predominantly retail investors, or help viable new hi-tech unicorns raise funds and realise their true value? The timing is more auspicious than the launch of its cousin, ChiNext, a decade ago in Shenzhen. That was in the midst of the global financial crisis, and its total valuation is still 60 per cent off its peak in 2015.Policymakers want it to be different this time. The ongoing trade war with the United States means many Chinese start-ups will prefer to raise capital onshore than try to list in a country that has been openly hostile to China's technological rise.Star Market was effectively created on the order of President Xi Jinping in November. It aims to provide a freer market mechanism to fund technological innovation rather than infrastructure projects. To discourage inexperienced retail investors, trading on the new market is restricted to players with at least two years of experience and 500,000 yuan in available funds. But the thresholds may be too low to make a difference. More than 140 firms in technology and science have applied for listing, which could collectively raise 128.8 billion yuan. If successful, that will certainly give Hong Kong's stock exchange a run for its money. Since last year, the city has revamped its listing rules in a bid to attract mainland Chinese firms. The loosening of rules includes allowing companies with dual-class share structures and unprofitable biotechnology start-ups to go public. Dual-class structures allow existing owners or founders to retain their control of the company even if they only own a minority of shares after listing.Star Market will be the first exchange in China to allow unprofitable technology companies, not just biotech start-ups, to list. A new IPO system means companies are required to disclose their earnings and operations in their listing applications. But regulators will let the market decide their valuations once their applications have been cleared. Beijing has long wanted to woo back national champions such as Alibaba Group (which owns the South China Morning Post), Tencent and Xiaomi to list onshore. To avoid fizzling out like ChiNext did, Star Market needs to prove that it is truly market-driven and able to attract big-ticket unicorns.To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here[https://www.scmp.com/comment/article/3020400/nasdaq-style-star-market-must-show-it-more-casino?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign]",464,1,0.000839631,2,0.001679261,3,0.002518892,2,0.001679261,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0.002518892,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0
2,Successful transition at Alibaba lights the way for China firms,SCMP Editorial,11 September 2019,"The joint celebration of the 20th anniversary of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba and the 55th birthday of ­ co-founder Jack Ma[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] may have been remarkable in its own right. But what really set it apart is that Ma is stepping aside now to head in another direction. The media has long foreshadowed the planned early retirement of China's richest man. That did not stop speculation about the reason. It is a case of a high-profile Chinese tycoon who has worked out a succession plan for an innovative multinational with 100,000 employees and stepped down while still in his prime. It is hard to find other companies, particularly hi-tech firms, where such a succession plan is in place.Daniel Zhang Yong, Ma's successor as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of this newspaper, has pledged to advance globalisation, domestic consumption and a push into advanced technologies such as big data and cloud computing[https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3026603/alibaba-marks-20-year-milestone-pledge-push-forward-global-e].On a broader scale Ma's description of his retirement as the “beginning of a succession system” is important to China. A lot of Western economies have had hundreds of years' experience developing corporate governance and culture, including how to hand company operations to the next generation. In China a new generation of private entrepreneurs only started to appear in the 1980s and 1990s and the first generation often remains entrenched.Despite China's stellar growth and success in eradicating poverty among hundreds of millions, business transition remains a challenge for continued economic development. Indeed, it is estimated that if the generational transition is mishandled the adverse impact on the economy - particularly the private sector which generates most jobs and growth - could be a lasting drag to China's progress.With the economy facing headwinds, the government has become more supportive of the private sector. But successful transition cannot be driven by government support alone. Company founders are prone to keep working well into normal retirement years. This is not conducive to an orderly transition and an articulate vision of the future direction for a company and its employees. Worse for everyone, successors can take the reins when past their prime.Ma has in a sense rendered greater service to the economy in engineering timely transition, rather than carrying on, though shareholders may differ. Far from suggesting retirees have nothing further to contribute, he says he feels young and ready for other challenges in education and the environment. For Hong Kong, of course, Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] is the one that got away when New York snared its huge initial public offering in 2014. This because of a rule against dual-class share structures designed to preserve control of the founders. Hong Kong has since amended its regulations and local investors are awaiting more news of a secondary listing by Alibaba.To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here[https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3026797/successful-transition-alibaba-lights-way-china-firms?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign]",462,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,2,0.001679261,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.000839631,0,0,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0,0,0

It had dropped 2.3 per cent in the previous four sessions. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was almost unchanged at 26,725.68.Traders piled into banks after China kept the loan prime rate unchanged at 4.2 per cent this month, quelling concern that banks' lending margins will be hurt. The consensus estimate was a cut of five basis points in the rate, according to Bloomberg data. China Life Insurance also lifted sentiment, jumping 5 per cent after forecasting a profit increase of as much as 200 per cent for the first nine months.“Positive earnings expectations and the surprise decision not to lower the loan prime rate give banking shares considerable support,” said Gerry Alfonso, director of the international business department at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai. The unchanged loan prime rate was “likely to have only a short-lived impact on the equity market as the expected cut was marginal”.Poor economic data will not derail the rebound of Chinese stocks, as earnings growth may have troughed in the third quarter and a slew of market reforms may boost sentiment, said Citic Securities. Easing of listed companies' mergers and acquisitions[https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/3033878/chinas-easing-ma-rules-put-place-after-2015-market-crash-will], the push for a registration system for initial public offerings by more small companies and tighter delisting rules will improve the quality of listed companies, the nation's biggest publicly traded brokerage said in a note on Monday.A gauge of 34 listed banks on the mainland's exchanges rose 1.4 per cent. China Citic Bank added 4.3 per cent to 6.28 yuan and Ping An Bank advanced 2.3 per cent to 16.89 yuan.Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, the Chinese surveillance camera maker put on a trade blacklist by the US government for alleged human rights violations, climbed 3.8 per cent to 31.61 yuan, its biggest gain in seven weeks. The company said profit for the fourth quarter may increase by as much as 41 per cent from a year earlier after earnings grew by 17 per cent in the third quarter.Hikvision's median profit growth would be 20 per cent for the last three months of the year, according to Shenwan Hongyuan Group.Tianfeng Securities plummeted by the 10 per cent daily limit to 6.98 yuan after the lock-up period of a 35.4 per cent stake in the brokerage expired on Monday. Some 1.83 billion shares held by 36 pre-IPO shareholders became available for public trading after Tianfeng's debut in Shanghai a year ago.In Hong Kong, Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping rallied after the mainland's exchanges officially revised rules to allow onshore investors to buy Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies with dual-class share structures starting next week. Smartphone maker Xiaomi surged 5 per cent to HK$8.98, while internet service giant Meituan climbed 4.3 per cent to HK$96.75. Xiaomi's rise was also fuelled after the founder said on Sunday that the company plans to launch 10 smartphone models based on 5G technology.To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3033894/china-life-citic-bank-help-benchmark-shanghai-composite?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign]",580,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,4,0.003358522,2,0.001679261,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,2,0.001679261,2,0.001679261,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,Alibaba gives Hong Kong vote of confidence,SCMP Editorial,19 November 2019,"* ‘Homecoming' listing of world's largest online shopping platform may raise as much as US$13.4 billion and support city's status as a global financial hub despite the ongoing social unrestAmid all the bad news, Hong Kong's main bourse has something to celebrate. Alibaba, the world's largest online shopping platform, will have a “homecoming” listing later this month. The secondary listing is expected to raise US$10 billion but could be as high as US$13.4 billion if a “greenshoe” option is exercised to offer an extra 15 per cent of shares to investors. It will beat the US$8 billion raised by Uber, the ride-hailing company, when it listed in New York in May.But the real significance of Alibaba's return to Hong Kong is the vote of confidence in the city's status as a global financial hub despite the ongoing social unrest. It will also be the city's first paperless, fully automated listing, ending the need for retail investors to queue for subscription forms. The prospectus will only be available online. Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post, is regarded as “the one that got away” by the Hong Kong stock exchange when it listed in New York in 2014 with a flotation worth US$25 billion. The company is considered Asia's most valuable by market capitalisation.Back then, local regulators held on to the once sacred principle of “one share, one vote”, established as a cardinal rule of share ownership in Hong Kong from at least the 1980s. Since then, the rules have been loosened as part of a financial reform to stay competitive with other global bourses such as those in New York, London and Shanghai. This means allowing dual-class share ownerships favoured by many new-economy and biotech companies to allow founders and/or management to retain strategic control even if they do not own a majority stake.Alibaba will be the first tech blue chip to heed Beijing's call for those having listed overseas to return home. Its expected success will encourage others to follow. But that may already be the next trend as an increasingly hostile United States, which at one point last month even threatened to delist Chinese companies, may no longer be considered welcome ground to help them raise capital, profile and prestige.With Alibaba helping to put Hong Kong once again back at the top of the IPO market, it's something for investors and officials to cheer about in these gloomy times.To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here[https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3038463/alibaba-gives-hong-kong-vote-confidence?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign]",411,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,4,0.003358522,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0.001679261,0,0,0,0
5,Savvy New York Alibaba traders bagging profits through a temporary arbitrage opportunity,Zhang Shidong in Shanghai,9 December 2019,"* Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares have cost as much as US$7.68 more than its US stock certificates* More confidence in the e-commerce giant by investors closer to home explains the gapIt's an opportunity that will not last, but savvy traders holding US-listed Alibaba stock certificates have been bagging profits by capitalising on shares costing more in Hong Kong.The manoeuvre is known as arbitraging, in which a trader makes a profit on securities selling on separate exchanges at different prices.Over the nine days that China's e-commerce giant has been trading in a secondary listing in Hong Kong, excitement pushed the share price up - beyond what it was in the US. At one point, Alibaba's shares were as much as US$7.68 more expensive per share in Hong Kong than in New York, where it originally listed five years ago.Traders were able to exchange their US-listed securities through what are known as American depository receipts (ADRs) for the higher priced Hong Kong shares. Then they were able to sell them and pocket the difference.Traders in Hong Kong drove the price up in part because they expect Alibaba will become even more valuable once it is eventually added to the trading link between the city and mainland China.With foothold in Hong Kong's stock market, Alibaba sets itself lifespan goal of 102 years[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3039609/its-foothold-hong-kongs-stock-market-alibaba-sets-itself]Traders on the mainland - where Alibaba's electronic payment system Alipay and its online shopping malls are wildly popular - are expected to pile into the home-grown superstar once they can buy it for the first time on the Stock Connect.Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.The premium Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares command “is justified because investors in Hong Kong have higher appetite for China and better understanding of China risks than in the US,” said Karine Hirn, a Hong Kong-based partner at East Capital, which has US$5.4 billion in assets under management. “Also Alibaba will be part of the Stock Connect in about six months.”Investors in Hong Kong and mainland China are familiar with such price differences.It is not unusual for Chinese companies to be listed in both Hong Kong and mainland China. The stocks have an average discrepancy of almost 30 per cent. Two camps of traders can have very different mindsets on the same investment.While the price gaps of the biggest dual-listed companies, such as Ping An Insurance Group and China Merchants Bank, are currently no more than 10 per cent, the most extreme discrepancies are among some small-caps and exceed 300 per cent.Goldman Sachs is among investment houses expecting big gains for Alibaba in the coming year. It initiated covered of the stock with a “buy” rating and a 12-month price target of HK$252. If it is right, that would be more than a 28 per cent gain.Part of the big expectation for Alibaba is that it belongs to a generation of Chinese superstars that chose to list elsewhere, generally either in the US or Hong Kong. Tencent Holdings, China's biggest social media company, for example, went public in Hong Kong, while JD.com, which rivals Alibaba in e-commerce, is listed on the Nasdaq.Chinese traders face restrictions on trading stocks overseas, and therefore turn to stocks of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies available through the Stock Connect.Alibaba, which last month raised HK$101.2 billion (US$12.9 billion) in the city's biggest stock offering in nine years, joins the Hang Seng Composite Index on Monday. The index covers a wider array of 481 stocks trading in the city than the 50-member Hang Seng Index. The gauge compiler put Alibaba on a fast track for inclusion.Being on the broad index is a prerequisite for Alibaba shares to join the Stock Connect.Alibaba shares rise in Hong Kong debut, creating city's biggest stock[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3039329/alibaba-shares-rise-63-cent-hong-kong-market-debut-after]Other requirements include trading for about seven months and having a market capitalisation of at least HK$20 billion, according to the latest rules by the exchanges in Hong Kong and mainland China.While expectations are high that Alibaba will be added to the Connect on schedule, it remains a wild card because it takes action by the Chinese securities regulator.In addition, no company as a secondary listing is available on the Stock Connect. That means the China Securities Regulatory Commission would need to take a special step to allow Alibaba to be bought at home.The benefits of joining the Stock Connect are clear.Shares of Meituan Dianping, one of the first two Chinese companies with dual-class share structures to be included in the programme, have climbed 14 per cent since the stock first became available to mainland investors on October 28. Average daily trading volumes of the online service provider from food delivery to ticketing were 35 per cent higher than in the earlier part of the year.Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi shares jump as they become available to mainland traders on Stock Connect[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/3034568/mainland-investors-giddy-about-soon-getting-access]“Joining the Stock Connect will of course be seen as a catalyst for Alibaba in the short term,” said Ken Chen, a strategist at KGI Securities in Shanghai. “Typically, there's more willingness by investors to invest in companies from their home countries. That is the same for either Chinese or US investors.”Still, the price gap between Alibaba's Hong Kong shares and its ADRs will eventually disappear or be very marginal in the long turn, some investors including HSBC Jintrust Fund Management say.“Room for bigger premiums will be very limited because these companies already enjoy pretty high valuations,” said Chen Yu, a fund manager at the Shanghai-based firm with US$3.5 billion in asset under management who invests in Hong Kong shares through the Stock Connect.“Given Hong Kong is still a market dominated by international investors, the influence of mainland investors over either the broader market or individual stocks is still limited. Therefore, these companies are unlikely to have long-running and significant premiums simply because of the preference by mainland investors.”That is starting to be seen with Alibaba.The premium peaked on November 28, and it quickly narrowed afterwards. Alibaba's shares closed at HK$197.5 on Friday and its ADRs last traded at US$200 in New York, implying a premium of US$1.80. Each of the surrogate securities represents eight Hong Kong-traded shares.The ADRs have already risen 194 per cent since the initial public offering in 2014.The operator of China's biggest e-commerce platform is not the only company from the Asian nation that trades in both Hong Kong and the US. China Telecom, China Life Insurance and BeiGene are also among Chinese firms with listings in the two markets.Investment banks still predict Alibaba's Hong Kong shares will outperform the depository receipts going forward. The Hong Kong shares will rise 19 per cent in the following 12 months, while its ADRs will gain 14 per cent in the period, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.“A stock market that is close to the company's home country or in its home country is usually more helpful for share performances,” said Chen at KGI Securities. “Local investors feel more confident in investing in their home-country stocks as they have more and thorough exposure to trading information.”To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3041135/savvy-new-york-alibaba-traders-bagging-profits-through-temporary?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign]",1171,3,0.002518892,1,0.000839631,19,0.015952981,15,0.012594458,0,0,0,0,1,0.000839631,0,0,1,0.000839631,2,0.001679261,0,0,0,0
6,"Hong Kong beats Nasdaq to IPO crown as Alibaba, Budweiser mega listings lift funds raised to US$40 billion for 2019",Enoch Yiu,27 December 2019,"* The Hong Kong stock exchange shot ahead of Nasdaq thanks to Alibaba's mega listing in November, which raised US$12.9 billion* Outlook for 2020 is good, say analysts, as Alibaba's performance since debut, and a breakthrough in US-China trade talks attract more listingsHong Kong has again taken the crown as the world's largest initial public offering market worldwide.The mega listing of Alibaba Group Holding in November pushed it to the top of the league for the seventh times in 11 years, according to data from Refinitiv.Some 144 companies have raised US$40 billion on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange this year, as of December 26, 8.7 per cent higher than the US$36.8 billion raised in 2018. It is the highest amount raised in a single year since 2010.Besides Alibaba, Hong Kong's main board also attracted Budweiser Brewing Co APAC, the Asia-Pacific arm of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer. The beer maker raised US$5.7 billion in the fourth largest IPO worldwide this year.The two blockbuster listings allowed Hong Kong to jump ahead of Nasdaq, in second place, which raised US$27.5 billion. Nasdaq attracted listings including ride-hailing company Lyft's IPO of US$2.6 billion and Brazilian digital broker XP, which raised US$2.2 billion.Tha Saudi Stock Exchange, which was not in the top 10 list last year, finished third in 2019 after state oil giant Saudi Aramco's IPO worth US$25.6 billion earlier this month. It was the world's biggest IPO of all time, bypassing Alibaba's US$25 billion offering in New York in September 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.[https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/26/f682b466-27d5-11ea-9939-941d1970c7f1_image_hires_200424.jpg]“The successful listing of Alibaba in Hong Kong set to encourage more technology companies that have already listed in the US to consider a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2020,” said Edmond Hui, chief executive of Bright Smart Securities.Hui said the success of the IPO market in Hong Kong owed much to major listing reforms carried out in April last year. The regulatory changes allowed dual-class share structured technology companies as well as pre-revenue biotech firms to list here for the first time.At the same time, it made it easier for tech companies already listed in the US or UK to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong, which paved the way for Alibaba's listing. Refinitiv said it counts secondary listings in new jurisdictions as IPOs when compiling its global rankings.[https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/26/6d5f6d6a-27d4-11ea-9939-941d1970c7f1_image_hires_200424.jpg]“Since Alibaba's listing in Hong Kong in late November, its share price has risen almost 20 per cent while its turnover represents between 2 and 10 per cent of total market turnover. It is very popular with investors. This will encourage US-listed JD.com, or even Saudi Aramco, to consider having a secondary listing in Hong Kong over the next few years,” Hui said.Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector and chief executive of Christfund Securities, is also sanguine.“The market sentiment in Hong Kong in the summertime was hit hard by the trade war and the local social unrest. But the worst is over as we have seen more positive news about the trade agreement between the US and China recently. We are going to see more IPOs here next year,” Cheung said.Alibaba's US$12.9 billion listing in Hong Kong is the second-largest IPO worldwide this year and the largest in Hong Kong.New York Stock Exchange, a key rival of Hong Kong, ranked fourth in this year's table, raising US$23.4 billion for 38 companies, including Uber Technologies' US$8.1 billion offering in May.To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3043581/hong-kong-beats-nasdaq-ipo-crown-alibaba-budweiser-mega-listings?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign]",582,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,2,0.001679261,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.000839631,0,0,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,Why even a protest-hit Hong Kong won't lose its IPO crown to Singapore,Jacqueline Woo,20 January 2020,"* Singapore is just not as competitive when it comes to raising capital* The question for Singapore companies that have switched to the Hong Kong exchange is: was it the right call?When Chinese tech giant Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] made its debut on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) in November, the world sat up to watch.The stock finished 6.6 per cent higher in a heavily oversubscribed initial public offering (IPO) that raised about US$13 billion. It easily became one of the biggest listings globally last year, second only to Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company.For the HKEX, it was a homecoming of sorts, given that founder Jack Ma[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] had wanted to go public in Hong Kong back in 2014, before the company - which owns the South China Morning Post - decided on New York for its first listing.It was also the largest IPO to have landed on the stock exchange last year, propelling the local bourse to retain its crown as the world's top fundraising destination - a bright spot for a city that continues to be rocked by months of civil unrest[https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-protests].Elsewhere, four months earlier, competitor Singapore Exchange (SGX) had also hosted what would become its largest IPO for the year, but to a slightly different reception.US office real-estate investment trust Prime US Reit ended its first day on the open market on a tepid note, closing at its IPO price of US$0.88. The stock sale, also oversubscribed, raised US$833 million.While the first day of trading for these two stocks is merely a snapshot of how they could perform in time to come - with no immunity to swings both upwards or down - they do provide an indication of the widening gap between Hong Kong and Singapore[https://www.scmp.com/topics/singapore] when it comes to raising capital.Specifically, as Hong Kong retains its IPO crown, Singapore is trailing further behind in attracting growth-oriented companies.“Hong Kong has outshone Singapore in the global IPO race over the years, mainly driven by a strong pipeline of mainland companies seeking to list overseas,” said Singapore-based CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang. “Singapore is simply lacking an equivalent competitive edge.”A TALE OF TWO EXCHANGESAmid a host of global uncertainties, the HKEX attracted 161 IPOs and first-time listings (Mainboard and GEM) amounting to US$40.28 billion last year, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. Besides the mammoth Alibaba listing, the stock exchange was also home to Budweiser Brewing Co APAC's US$5.75 billion launch.The SGX, in comparison, drew 11 deals (Mainboard and Catalist) worth US$1.96 billion. After Prime US Reit, Lendlease Commercial Global Reit and Eagle Hospitality Reit took the top spots, raising proceeds of US$738.4 million and US$482.1 million respectively.The bourse has been grappling with a slew of delistings in recent years. It had 722 listed securities in the market as at December 2019, compared with a peak of 782 in 2010, going by data on the SGX. Notably, many of the delistings included Singapore companies that chose to list in Hong Kong over their home market.Among some of the high-profile ones were Singapore massage chair-maker Osim International, which left the SGX in 2016 and attempted to list on the HKEX as V3 Group, though unsuccessfully. Singapore-based gaming unicorn Razer also dealt the bourse a blow when it opted to go public in Hong Kong in 2017.In 2018, GIC-backed warehouse operator Global Logistic Properties quit the SGX, and, last June, dual-listed Fortune Reit also packed up and left, citing a decision to better reflect the Reit's asset profile (all of its properties are located in Hong Kong) and move out of thin trading volumes on the SGX. Engineering services provider CTR Holdings was the latest to get on the bandwagon.In a comparison of the two financial hubs, the biggest draw for such companies has been HKEX's liquidity.“The Hong Kong market offers better liquidity and a larger pool of investors from North Asia. This gives Singapore companies better access to the liquidity pool and perhaps higher valuations,” said Yang.HKEX's total market capitalisation, at HK$39.45 trillion, is more than six times that of the SGX, and its daily turnover around 13 times more, based on December's figures. It has seen 22 listings so far this year, of which seven took place on Thursday - its single busiest day since July 2018.She added that while Singapore boasts advantages such as its favourable tax scheme - “making it a perfect destination for Reit listings” - a stable political environment, and a reliable regulation and legal system, the problem was that it lacked liquidity and connectivity with the rest of the world.The HKEX is involved in a cross-border investment channel that links Hong Kong and the mainland, known as the Stock Connect, which allows international and mainland investors to trade securities in each other's markets through the trading and clearing facilities of their home exchange. The scheme, launched in 2014, covers more than 2,000 equities in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong today.“We are in an unparalleled moment in history for business and capital formation in China - as such we expect Hong Kong to continue to be an epicentre for new issuance and a focus for global investors. Alibaba's success is a good barometer of this trend,” said Udhay Furtado, the co-head of Equity Capital Markets at Citi Asia Pacific. That said, Singapore continued to have unique advantages in a global listing context, he added. “Citi has led a robust uptick in financing volume for S-Reits and we expect to see large regional Southeast Asia businesses list on SGX.”FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE?But making the shift from Singapore to Hong Kong has not been all smooth sailing.Many of the companies that moved have seen their share prices dip below the IPO prices - Razer today trades at about a third of its HK$3.88 IPO price, at HK$1.44 - while others, like V3, have not been successful in getting a listing off the ground.“The relatively smaller size of these companies [compared to other listings] means they may not be able to attract as much investor attention post-listing,” observed Tham Tuck Seng, Capital Markets Leader at PwC Singapore.Stefanie Yuen-Thio, joint managing partner of TSMP Law Corporation in Singapore, said: “You need to be a heavy hitter to make waves in Hong Kong, and companies that would be feted as home-grown stock market darlings in Singapore may get a more lukewarm reception in Hong Kong.“I wonder if these same companies would consider listing in Hong Kong today, given its unrest and the general market sentiment that the protests are an irreversible tectonic shift in the foundation of the Special Administrative Region.”The question remains: was leaving Singapore for Hong Kong the right call?“In terms of stock performance, it is driven by different factors, so it's really hard to say,” said Hong Kong-based Kenny Wen, who is wealth management strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai.“But in terms of trading volume and attracting global institutional investors and mutual funds, I think they have been better off.”Beyond market depth and higher daily trading volumes, Wen said that listing regulation reforms in 2018, such as new rules for biotechnology companies and those with weighted voting rights, had helped keep the HKEX in the lead.He pointed out that while the social unrest in Hong Kong[https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-protests] had put a dent in the city's reputation as a financial and business hub, pushing the economy into recession for the first time in a decade, it had had little impact on the IPO market so far.A more significant factor was the ongoing US-China trade war[https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war], which has led several Chinese companies listed in the US to move back to Hong Kong, including Alibaba. Nasdaq-listed Chinese search engine Baidu is said to be eyeing a secondary listing in Hong Kong as well. “Getting Alibaba to list successfully in Hong Kong was very important. It shows that even though there was social unrest, we were still able to handle this mega-deal smoothly,” he said. “It will become a model case for attracting other Chinese companies to be listed in Hong Kong.”That said, it is the lack of an end in sight to the months of unrest that poses a wild card for the HKEX.Yuen-Thio shared that she had heard it was business as usual in stock market fundraisings there, “even if some days the lawyers and bankers have to take a two-hour detour to get to the office because of transport disruptions from the protests”. “However, I believe that it is the future IPOs where the protests will have the most effect,” she said. “Companies planning to list in Hong Kong are looking for alternatives. Other stock exchanges and private equity funds are likely to be the big winners here.”SGX: A PLACE FOR NICHE LISTINGSTo be clear, the SGX has also taken big steps to stay relevant and competitive.It went from initially barring dual-class share structures to giving them the green light in 2018, among other measures. Just last week, it scrapped the quarterly reporting requirement for listed companies unless they are associated with higher risks.But analysts believe more still needs to be done to promote Singapore as an IPO destination.As it stands now, Yuen-Thio believes a comparison between the two cities is outdated.“Hong Kong's stock market is part of the Chinese financial ecosystem while Singapore stands independent. We do not have access to capital that China provides, but we are also an independent nation state. I believe that some IPO aspirants who had previously considered Hong Kong would naturally consider Singapore too, but it will be because of our reputation for being a reputable and independent financial centre; we are not for those looking for a stock market as a casino.”The key, PwC's Tham added, is to recognise Singapore not as a one-size-fits-all exchange, but one that attracts niche listings. The SGX continues to be well regarded in sectors such as Reits/business trusts, health care, and food and beverage.“If we look at the IPO track record in Singapore over the last 10 years, the number of listings ranged between 10 and 30, with proceeds raised between US$400 million and US$8 billion,” he said.“We expect 2020 to be a busier year for IPOs in Singapore. Should the number of listings and total proceeds reach the top end of [its IPO track record], it would be considered a good year.” ■Sign up now[https://surveys.scmp.com/survey/SCMP_Related?utm_source=chinatech_article&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=related_article] for our 50% early bird offer from SCMP Research: China AI Report.

8,Ant Group's plan is just the spark that is needed to revive Chinese companies' dual-listing ambitions,Zhang Shidong in Shanghai,1 August 2020,"* Door for easier dual-listings has been reopened after an overhaul of rules by the Hong Kong and mainland's stock exchanges* Tsingtao Brewery blazed trail for dual listings in July 1993The high-stake share-offering plan by Ant Group [https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3095567/how-chinas-ant-evolving-payments-app-technology-champion] is likely to revive a practice that was once popular among Chinese companies seeking to go public: dual-listings in the mainland and Hong Kong.Hong Kong has been a vital fundraising avenue for mainland companies over the past three decades, helping major state-owned enterprises to access global money, foster better corporate governance and achieve faster growth. A total of 125 Chinese companies have dual listings.The first company to opt for a dual-listing was Tsingtao Brewery, which started trading in Hong Kong in July 1993 after being revamped from a state-owned factory in the eastern city of Shandong. Since then, Tsingtao Brewery's market cap has grown more than 100 fold to US$14.3 billion, making it the biggest beer brewery in the Asia-Pacific region. The listing was followed by a slew of medium-sized SOEs, including Shanghai Petrochemical and Yizheng Petrochemical.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter [https://www.scmp.com/newsletter/scmp-global-impact] on the big stories originating in China.The mega dual-listings of the SOEs was extremely popular in the early 2000s, when the nation's five biggest banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China [https://www.scmp.com/topics/icbc] and China Construction Bank [https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-construction-bank], raised billions of dollars from the stock flotations.It was significant for both Hong Kong and Chinese companies. With the additions of the likes of ICBC and PetroChina [https://www.scmp.com/topics/petrochina], Hong Kong's market has grown to the world's fourth largest with a market cap of US$5.6 trillion. Meanwhile, the listings have elevated China's major SOEs to be ranked among the world's biggest companies now.The dual-listing process was interrupted after the global financial crisis deflated the bubbles on the mainland and Hong Kong markets in 2008 and a raft of Chinese hi-tech companies, including Alibaba Group Holding [https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1595877/alibaba-prices-ipo-shares-us68-each], the owner of this newspaper, and NetEase, [https://www.scmp.com/topics/netease] chose the US over the city because of hurdles over listing rules.The door for easier dual-listings has been reopened after an overhaul of listing rules [https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124503/hong-kong-overhauls-citys-stock-listing-rules-attract-biotech] by the Hong Kong and mainland's exchanges [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3042292/beijing-just-made-it-easier-listed-companies-ipo-spun-units]. Both bourses have now accept companies that have a dual-class share structure and are yet to report a profit.Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp [https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3091963/smic-track-float-chinas-largest-offering-10-years-national-pride], China's biggest chip maker, is the most recent case of dual-listings. After seven years of trading in Hong Kong, it raised US$7.5 billion from Shanghai's new technology board for the mainland's biggest offering in a decade last month.While Hong Kong listings enable Chinese companies to tap the base of overseas traders, selling shares on the mainland will give them higher valuations. Among the 125 dual-listed companies, all the onshore shares are more expensive than the offshore ones in Hong Kong, according to data provider Shanghai DZH. Smaller companies have the widest price gaps, while bigger ones have the least.Auto-part maker Zhejiang Shibao has the biggest price difference - its Shenzhen-traded shares are six times as expensive as its Hong Kong stock. Ping An Insurance Group is the least extreme - the difference between the stocks was less than 3 per cent on Friday.With fundraising in Hong Kong shifting from SOEs to China's hi-tech companies, there will be more dual-listings going forward, according to Wei Shanwei, deputy general manager at Huajing Securities.Purchase the 120+ page China Internet Report 2020 Pro Edition, brought to you by SCMP Research, and enjoy a 30% discount (original price US$400).

9,Cautious optimism as nascent Star Market proves to be a winner,SCMP Editorial,3 August 2020,"* Regulators need to be mindful of bubbles but if the bourse continues to turn out quality tech companies, it will stand China's capital markets in good steadThe Star Market has been on a roll having completed more initial public offerings (IPOs) and raised more capital than any other Chinese bourses, on the mainland or in Hong Kong, this year.The Nasdaq-style bourse has achieved all that during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, having been in operation for only a year. Now, people even fret a bubble is forming as many of its listed members enjoy sky-high valuations. It is time to be cautious, but also to recognise success.The new bourse is an experiment in market reforms, a clear indication of Beijing's awareness that the Chinese markets need to improve markedly to attract new capital and interest from professional and foreign investors and underwriters. Policymakers may now be encouraged to further loosen capital controls.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter[https://www.scmp.com/newsletter/scmp-global-impact] on the big stories originating in China.Designed to encourage China's home-grown technology champions to stay home, the Star - which officially stands for the Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board - has catered to institutional investors from day one, rather than retail punters who dominate the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.The idea is that Chinese pension funds and institutional investors should reap the capital gains of the nation's corporate champions. Why not? Two of the world's 10 most valuable companies are Chinese - Alibaba, owner of the Post, and Tencent.Neither is listed on the mainland. So the Star Market provides an arena for future champions to raise capital, and spread benefits of their growth.Opening up China's capital markets fits well with the overall macroeconomic model in switching from export-led growth to a consumption-oriented one.The Chinese economy is still dominated by many inefficient state-owned enterprises that make up most of the valuation on mainland stock exchanges. The Star Market can attract new capital and expertise from professional underwriting from investment banks and money from global investors.But they do not want to buy any old state-run firms. Tech companies with far greater growth prospects will whet their appetite.The rules for listing are much more streamlined and transparent to encourage efficiency. The Star Market allows companies with dual-class share structures, as well as those listed outside the country.This allows US-listed firms to come home. Already, the Star Market has helped China's largest semiconductor producer to raise more capital after delisting from New York.Also, many mainland unicorns are backed by foreign private-equity funds. With dual listings, those investors can exit through Hong Kong, while enjoying higher valuations on the mainland.The world has yet to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and regulators need to be mindful of bubbles. But if the Star Market continues to turn out quality tech companies, it will stand China's capital markets in good stead.China's healthcare sector was one of the best-performing equity classes globally in the first half of 2020.

Aguzin[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3134415/hkexs-new-ceo-nicolas-aguzin-will-be-hong-kongs-highest], 52, faces “quite a big challenge ahead, as Li did a great job in terms of communications and links with the mainland”, said Wang Chen, a partner at Xufunds Investment Management in Shanghai. “The arrival of the new CEO will create uncertainty over HKEX’s links with China. The other pressing task for him is to nail down a new driver for earnings growth for HKEX, to keep the momentum alive and digest its stretched valuation.”During Li’s decade-long stint, HKEX saw its market capitalisation almost triple; it claimed the title of the world’s biggest initial public offering (IPO) market in seven out of the past 12 years; and fostered unprecedented trading links with mainland Chinese peers. Under Li’s stewardship, Hong Kong was able to solidify its position as a global financial hub, even as the coronavirus pandemic and the anti-government protests before that plunged the city into its worst-ever economic recession.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Biden has kept alive an array of executive orders passed by the Trump administration, including sanctions against Chinese companies which it says are linked to the country’s military, and increased scrutiny of Chinese companies listed on US stock exchanges.This will fuel an IPO boom that has seen the likes of Chinese technology companies such as Baidu and Bilibili list in the city. The bourse operator is also deepening an overhaul[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3134200/hong-kong-lifts-listing-bar-first-time-nearly-three] of listing rules that started in 2018[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3131649/hong-kong-exchange-operator-hkex-expand-reforms-brought], aiming to make it easier for Chinese companies with shares traded on US exchanges to launch secondary flotations in Hong Kong.A total of 146 new economy companies have gone public in Hong Kong over the past three years, raising a combined HK$682.2 billion (US$87.9 billion). In the first quarter this year, the value of new listings has surged nine-fold to HK$136 billion, according to HKEX’s quarterly results[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3131375/hkex-reports-its-best-quarter-record-booming-stock-market].On the other hand, waning interest in stock trading will probably be the biggest headwind facing HKEX for the rest of the year, said Sharnie Wong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. She estimated that full-year earnings growth would slow to 31 per cent from 70 per cent in the first quarter, because the spike in stock transactions in the first three months of this year was difficult to repeat.The average daily value of shares that changed hands on the Hong Kong exchange surged 91 per cent from a year earlier to HK$198 billion in the first quarter, buoyed by a spurt in two-way trading through the Stock Connect programme. The daily turnover dropped to HK$151 billion this quarter, according to Bloomberg data.HKEX shares also slipped 0.9 per cent to HK$453.60 on Friday, extending to 25 per cent their decline from a record high set on February 19. The stock has been whipsawed over the past few weeks by jitters about shrinking trade volumes. Traders have been spooked by the prospect of the US Federal Reserve tapering its loose monetary policies and China’s crackdown on what it says are monopolistic practices among technology giants.China Merchants Securities has maintained a neutral rating on HKEX since February, citing its above-average valuation. The stock is trading at about 40 times its projected earnings this year and is 28 per cent more expensive that its five-year average, according to Felix Luo, a Hong Kong-based analyst at the brokerage. “Given its range of historical valuations, the current multiple isn’t that attractive,” he said.The company is valued at US$74.1 billion in market capitalisation, and is the world’s second-most valuable bourse operator, according to Bloomberg data. CME Group, which owns the Chicago and New York mercantile exchanges, is the biggest with a market capitalisation of US$78.2 billion.Click to view image.[https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/24/5dc97e04-ba1d-11eb-9461-e80e43f535ad_1320x770_101052.jpg]JPMorgan views the launch of derivative products linked with China’s onshore stocks as a future growth driver for HKEX. “Approval of A-share futures is a potential catalyst,” said Harsh Modi, an analyst at the US bank.Aguzin will be HKEX’s first non-Chinese CEO[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3123798/hong-kongs-sfc-approves-augzin-hkex-ceo] and his connections with China’s financial regulators might be a cause of concern among some investors.

Reuters’ rumour involving the management change at Didi is inaccurate information,” the Beijing-based tech giant said.Didi has been at the centre of a regulatory storm in China since the Cyberspace Administration of China initiated a cybersecurity probe[https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3139665/chinas-cyberspace-administration-launches-probe-ride-hailing-giant] into the company in early July, just days after its blockbuster US$4.4 billion initial public offering[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3139520/didi-chuxing-propels-chinese-ipos-record-capital-raising-us-first-half] in the US. A group of seven regulators, including the state security ministry and public security ministry, started an on-site investigation in mid-July.While the investigation remains ongoing, 25 apps associated with Didi[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3140593/chinese-regulators-order-25-more-didi-linked-apps-removed-stores] were removed from Chinese app stores and the ride-hailing firm was ordered to stop registering new users.Neither Beijing nor Didi have offered information on the progress of the investigation, fanning speculation about the company’s fate after it “forced its way” to an IPO overseas against the advice of the cybersecurity regulator. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Vice-Premier Liu He was forced to offer “self-criticism”, a practice once common under Mao Zedong, for failing to stop Didi from going public.Since the start of the investigation, Didi has denied a slew of reports regarding its future. The company said it is not seeking to go private, as reported by Bloomberg in June. It also denied that it would hand data over to a third party, seek large new shareholders, or that the local Beijing government would take a stake in the company, as Reuters has reported.Click to view image.[https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/09/21/cdd75752-1a99-11ec-897a-4119d31a6faa_972x_131940.jpg]In August, the South China Morning Post reported that the outcome of the investigation could lead to “changes in management”[https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3144671/chinas-probe-ride-hailing-giant-didi-chuxing-may-lead-management], which Didi denied as well.The latest denial on Monday was the first time that Didi called out a news outlet by name and threatened legal action.Liu joined Didi in 2014 as a co-founder and holds a 1.6 per cent stake in the company, which is currently worth around US$640 million. The dual-class share structure gives Liu 23 per cent voting rights. Liu, daughter of tech tycoon and Lenovo[https://www.scmp.com/topics/lenovo] founder Liu Chuanzhi, worked as a banker at Goldman Sachs before joining the ride-hailing firm.Didi’s daily active users have reportedly plunged by 30 per cent[https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3149020/didis-daily-active-users-plunge-30-pc-financial-times-reports] since its IPO, according to the Financial Times, citing data from a Shenzhen-based provider. Before its current troubles, Didi had 493 million annual active users globally and 13 million active drivers in China, with about 90 per cent of the country’s ride-hailing market.Earlier this month, the Post reported that Didi has set up a committee headed by its founder to oversee the overhaul of its data management[https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3147867/didis-founder-heads-committee-manage-data-security-yielding-chinas], as the ride-hailing giant accedes to regulators’ demands in a move described internally as “a matter of survival”.The company’s founder and CEO Cheng Wei will head the Information and Data Security committee established in July, according to an internal memo seen by the Post. Chief technology officer Zhang Bo will be the executive deputy director, giving the new committee a broader scope than the previous group in charge of information security that was established in 2016.The committee will comprise a number of units that oversee data security, cyberspace and information security, personal information protection, algorithm security, content security and overseas business privacy. A special secretariat was also created to handle emergency matters relating to data security, according to the memo.Every business division at Didi had to “fully cooperate with the state investigation”, Cheng said during an August 13 meeting, according to an attendee who declined to be named for discussing a confidential matter. Cheng said the company must study and implement the government’s policies and regulations, cooperate with the investigation and conduct rectifications, according to the attendee, and every Didi division has signed “a letter of commitment” to data security.",803,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,3,0.002518892,1,0.000839631,0,0,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0

China was the best performer, logging an average gain of 170 per cent, while Japan ranked second with a 62 per cent rise. South Korea and India took third and fourth places, respectively.That is a sharp reversal from a year earlier, when tech debutants in particular surged after demand for their IPOs far outstripped what was on offer. February proved to be a watershed, as increased signs that Beijing would tighten the screws on the tech industry spooked investors, causing the rally on the Hang Seng Index to falter.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

China’s biggest tech companies including Alibaba, NetEase and JD.com have completed secondary offerings in the city over the past two years, taking advantage of the new rules.Hong Kong’s worst-performing IPO issuer this year was Unity Enterprise Holdings, which tumbled 41 per cent from the offer price when it began trading on March 31. The Hong Kong-based company, which provides building repair and maintenance services, raised HK$140 million (US$18 million). It was followed by Sundy Service Group and Zhixin Group, which slumped 36 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, on debut.Some companies have seen hefty gains. Morimatsu International Holding is this year’s best performer, with the stock debuting with a 259 per cent jump on June 28. The most valuable flotation was Kuaishou Technology[https://www.scmp.com/topics/kuaishou], the Chinese short-video platform that raked in US$6.2 billion. While Kuaishou’s shares surged 161 per cent on the first day of trading on February 5, the stock is currently trading 29 per cent below the offer price amid poor sentiment sweeping the tech sector.Overall, 65 out of the 93 IPO issuers in Hong Kong this year currently trade below their offer price, underscoring investors’ caution on the outlook of the newly listed companies.This in contrast with the 140 per cent first-day gains on the mainland. The outsize gains in onshore IPOs are largely because of the rules that put a cap on prices to ensure there is no flop.Chinese exchange authorities are beginning to let market forces play a bigger role in the pricing of IPOs, allowing investors to bid higher prices for new shares of companies seeking to list on the boards for small-caps.Looking ahead, fund managers expect Hong Kong IPOs to deliver better returns next year on improving sentiment.HFT Investment Management, a Shanghai-based money manager with US$20 billion in asset under management, said that the fallout from the regulatory curbs will recede next year.CCB International, meanwhile, noted that the current multiple of 12 times projected earnings implied limited downside room for Hong Kong stocks.“The first half of next year is expected to open a window for re-ratings, with earnings possibly bottoming out in the middle of the year,” said Cliff Zhao, a strategist at the investment banking unit of China Construction Bank in Hong Kong.",750,1,0.000839631,1,0.000839631,5,0.004198153,4,0.003358522,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.000839631,0,0,0,0,0,0
13,How Hong Kong's stock exchange can become the leader of the pack,20 December 2021,* Our local bourse has been playing catch-up with its international peers for too long,"* A new set of listing rules to attract carbon-neutral companies or new energy vehicle manufacturers might be worth consideringWith various shocks and crises, whether man-made or natural, piling up against the local stock exchange, one wonders if the Hong Kong stock exchange is really up to the task of seizing opportunities in the midst of adversity.The Covid-19 pandemic has been ravaging the stock markets for nearly two years now, and on top of that the United States is looking to further tighten regulations[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3158245/us-moves-step-closer-delisting-chinese-companies] for US-listed Chinese companies.

Meanwhile, everybody else has been piling into “blank cheque” listings for two years.To be sure, the local bourse has always been rigorous in protecting local investors. Other stock exchanges such as New York prefer a lighter regulatory regime for listed firms, with investors being more responsible for their investment choices. There, if things go wrong, there is always the lawyer to consult.However, such a seemingly well-intentioned approach might be holding Hong Kong back when grasping opportunities in the face of crises such as US-China rivalry and climate change[https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change].Instead of following everybody else, couldn’t the Hong Kong stock exchange take the initiative and find ways to be a leader in innovation in the stock market while still protecting investors?

That translates to more investments for the index members, and capital leaving companies that are dropped from the gauge.“Big-capitalisation stocks from the new-economy sector, such as information technology and health care, will come to be included,” said Bruce Pang, head of research and macro strategy at China Renaissance in Hong Kong. “Furthermore, companies with secondary offerings or dual-class share structures will also have more weighting in the index.”The Hang Seng Indexes Company added JD.com, NetEase, ENN Energy and China Resources Beer to the index at the previous review in November 2021, raising the constituents to 64 stocks without removing anyone. The compiler aims to expand the key index to 80 stocks by mid-2022, and to 100 over time.No stocks are expected to be removed from the Hang Seng Index this time, according to the two investment banks, given the speed needed to enlarge the membership within the projected time-frame.The new additions are certain to swell the disproportionate representation and influence of mainland Chinese companies in the benchmark index, while exposing investors to wilder swings caused by the latest economic downturn and recent punitive regulatory crackdowns.More than half of the 2,571 companies listed in Hong Kong are China enterprises[https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Statistics/Consolidated-Reports/HKEX-Monthly-Market-Highlights?sc_lang=en], comprising H-share companies at the end of January, red chips and privately-owned entities, according to exchange data.
