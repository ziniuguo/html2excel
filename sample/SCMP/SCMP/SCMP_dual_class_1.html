<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) busies itself consulting on detailed trading rule changes, to pave the likely way for companies seeking dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, it's time to outline exactly what their inclusion in the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index would mean.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a proposal by HKEX, a one-month consultation period ends on March 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its plan is to attract three categories of new-economy companies to list here: large biotech companies without revenue, giant dual-class shareholding structured new economies companies, and US-listed mainland new-economy companies looking for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting right over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are popular among many tech firms such as US tech firm </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, and pointedly mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns South China Morning Post. The fact Hong Kong could not then offer Alibaba a dual-class structure was seen as a strong reason why the tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With several “unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion) expected to seek public funding in the not-too-distant future, such as Xiaomi, WeLab, Lufax, and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">, officials in Hong Kong are anxious not to have a repeat of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX expects to start accepting dual-class applications, soon after the end of the consultation's conclusion in late April, with the first dual-class share companies floating in the city as early as June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we still don't know whether or when successful dual-listed companies will eventually be allowed to be included in the benchmark Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's important, as many passive fund managers track the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index. If such companies were be added to these indexes, they could be accessed by a much larger pool of institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there are the Stock Connect share trading links between the Hong Kong exchange and its peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen to consider, which only allow the trading of stocks listed on the major Hang Seng Indexes (again, the Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index) to qualify, and in which mainlanders and mainland mutual funds have readily invested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong exchange's turnover comes via southbound trading over the Stock Connect links.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So if these stocks are not allowed to be included in the major indexes, mainlanders would unable to buy them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Indexes Company, which compiles the benchmark indices, completed its own public consultation on the issue, ending On February 28 - but it's still yet to publish its conclusions nearly a fortnight on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants themselves, say they still have mixed views on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers, supports the inclusion of dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index, giving a green light to mainlanders to plough into them via Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many passive fund managers, however, oppose the suggestion, as once dual-class shares are included in the leading Hang Seng indexes, they fear they would have no choice but to focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other fund managers express reservations on the dual-class structure as it violate the city's “one-share, one vote” rule - an important principle for listed companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, New York's S&amp;P and London's FTSE indexed have not included these companies in some of their indexes, as in some cases they add restrictions on calculating their weighting on a gauge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSCI, another major index complier, is also consulting the market on their inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland exchanges consider allowing them, we are going to see more of these companies listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any blanket ban on them appearing in major indexes would be unlikely - but we are likely to see some restrictions coming with such issuances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many sector the adage that “uncertainty breeds opportunity” rings true, but not in this case. Markets hate it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so it's now doubly important the Hang Seng Indexes Company and other compilers announce their final decision on dual-class shares, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's largest investment fund managers urged the Hong Kong stock exchange operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), to introduce more safeguards for protecting minority investors' interests when the bourse allows multiple class shareholding technology companies to list from June, in a seminar on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many fund managers who are also members of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> have opposed allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong as this is in breach of the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKIFA still believes that ‘one share, one vote' is best for investors. But with the listing reform a done deal, we will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list here,” said Sally Wong, the association's chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding companies are favoured by technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, as they allow founders and certain shareholders to retain more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies seeking to list dual-class shares may get green light to apply for Hong Kong listing by end June[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2128434/companies-seeking-list-dual-class-shares-may-get-green]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in 2014 as Hong Kong has banned dual-class shareholding companies from listing since the mid-1980s while the United States allows it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But after a lengthy debate, the Hong Kong government and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> now support the HKEX's listing reform plan allowing such companies to list, as the city wants to attract technology companies and compete with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, said on Tuesday the exchange will next month have a consultation on rule changes, including what investor protection measures should be introduced before dual-class shareholding companies can list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX has proposed that not all companies can be listed in such structures, and that it will allow only the very big technology companies to list with weighted voting rights. This will be conducted in a restricted fashion,” said Jonathan Lowe, the managing director of JPMorgan Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But I think some more additional safeguard measures will be needed.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronnie Lim Fook-yan, senior engagement specialist at Robeco Asia-Pacific, said the exchange should require dual-class shareholding companies to adopt equal voting rights for all types of shareholders in the situation of voting independent shareholders, so as to ensure these directors can represent minority shareholders' interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ‘one share, one vote' principle should also be adopted in approving related party transactions, he said. “There should be a clear disclosure about the special shareholding structure in the IPO prospectus. It is also important to educate investors to understand about their rights and risks in investing in these companies,” he said.We will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list hereSally Wong, chief executive, Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christine Chow Sheung-yi, the associate director of Hermes Investment Management, said all shareholders should be given the right to vote at the annual general shareholder meeting to decide if the dual-class shareholding structure should continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said a key reason for allowing such a structure is to allow founders to keep their corporate vision for the long term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, dual-class shareholding structures should not be a default but the founders and management have to work hard to earn them. It should allow all shareholders to judge if they have carried out the corporate vision well enough to achieve the benefit of the company, and to translate the founders' vision to become the corporate vision,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HSI Services, which compiles the Hang Seng Index, this week started a two-month consultation on whether dual-class shareholding companies should be included in the benchmark index, as passive investments will need to buy into these stocks if they are constituent stocks of the index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s Lowe said unless there was an extreme case, such as Snap, which allows its founders to have all voting rights while other shareholders have none, he believes other dual-class shareholding companies with reasonable governance could be included in the index.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong's stock market industry watchdog, will not be taking a front-row seat in new listing approvals, meaning the city can now push ahead with plans to launch a new market for dual-class shares in an effort top lure technology companies in particular to list here, according to brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The retreat by the SFC from taking a frontline role in approving new listings means HKEX (</span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">) and the listing committee can continue to share the task," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a local broker who is also the lawmaker representing the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is positive for the HKEX, allowing it to push ahead with another reform later, aimed at attracting more dual-class technology giants to list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class stock structure allows the issuing of various types of shares by a single company, where the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two share classes are typically issued: one share class is offered to the general public, and the other is offered to company founders, executives and family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to sources close to the matter, the SFC and HKEX are now set to unveil what commentators see as a watered-down conclusion to their five-month long consultation, with the SFC agreeing to back off from its desired front-line role in new listings approving, with the HKEX maintaining its primary role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is, however, to be represented on a new committee to formulate listing policies, but would not be able to appraise the performance of HKEX's listing staff, the sources told South China Morning Post on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC's retreat is obviously related to strong opposition from all sectors to its reform plans, with many worried that an upgraded role in approvals would have had a negative affect on the number of new listings," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the SFC now willing to compromise on listing reform, it is likely to be more open minded on allowing dual-class shares companies to list in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's two years since HKEX proposed allowing dual-class share listing in Hong Kong, which the SFC immediately opposed, fearing such a structure would be unfair to investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shares are still not allowed in Hong Kong, but the US does allow them, a factor which is largely credited with mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's opting for Wall Street instead of Hong Kong to list in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global equity strategist Christopher Wood said rejecting duel-listing in Hong Kong would be "stupid" and lead to lost future listing opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the key in future will be disclosure, and that as long as the dual-class shares companies were open about their shareholder structure, it would be up to investors to decide if they want to buy or walk away from an investment.The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpracticeJoseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed a two-month consultation into the launch of a new third board to allow dual-class share structure companies, and make it easier for start-ups to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform is expected to need a second consultation later this year. If it again gains strong support, the new board could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, however, maintains that dual-class shares could still be allowed to list on the main board instead of being forced to choose the new board. But he would not oppose market participants wanting to list on a new board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, believes the SFC will continue to use enforcement action to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpractice, if needed."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mike Wong Ming-wai, chief executive of the Chamber of Listed Companies of Hong Kong, said he was glad the SFC had retreated from its proposed plan to become directly involved in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We still worry, however, there may be over-regulation in the market if the SFC goes ahead with its proposal to set up a new committee involving its representatives in setting listing policies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC may still have an important influence on this committee and hence a tight curb on the new listing policies. We want to see Hong Kong remain a market that has listing rules friendly to all market players, instead of one which is regulatory led."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is Hong Kong's rival, and not Shanghai or Shenzhen, when it comes to attracting “unicorns”, according to Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Asian stock exchanges are vying with each other to change listing rules in a bid to attract new economy companies and dual-class shareholding structure firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen have never been competitors of Hong Kong as we always cooperate with each other. Tong said on the sidelines of a regulatory forum on Wednesday. “Rather, Singapore is a competitor of Hong Kong,” adding that if dual-class shareholding companies were to list in Hong Kong and in the mainland, it would be a win-win situation for both.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX, said last week that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong were planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a dual-class listing structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC's Tong said Hong Kong's stock market will not be affected by China's plans to attract new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong cooperates with mainland stock markets but we are very independent,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, owner of theSouth China Morning Post, chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structure allows shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian stock exchanges previously opposed such companies to list because it goes against the “one share one vote” principle. But now several exchanges are speeding up their reforms to explicitly allow dual-class shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of SFC, said at the same forum that the commission found shortcomings in the works of 31 financial firms that acted as listing sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some listing sponsors did not fulfil their duty with regards to due diligence on the companies they sponsored, falling short of the SFC requirements,” she said, adding the commission will issue a report on the matter soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also said the commission plans to study some brokers' demand to use WhatApp to take customer orders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Singapore maintained their high ranks in a report on corporate governance published on Wednesday, but a decision to allow listings by dual-class shareholding companies has eroded their edge over other jurisdictions in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report was presented by brokerage CLSA and non-profit organisation Asia Corporate Governance Association. The association ranked Hong Kong second in the region, with a score of 60 in its biennial survey, followed by 59 for Singapore in third position. CLSA, on the other hand, ranked Singapore second with 70.1 points, Japan third with 66.7 points and Hong Kong fourth with 66.3 points. Australia topped the rankings in both cases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2016, the non-profit ranked Singapore second and Hong Kong third, while CLSA ranked the Lion City third and the special administrative region fourth, behind Japan and Australia in second and first places, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threat to that fundamental driver [of better corporate governance],” the association and CLSA said in their joint report. While a belief "in the value of transparency and accountability remains largely intact, the third principle, fairness, has come under fire”, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shareholders with dual-class shares have different voting rights. Through this structure - popular among emerging companies and industries - founding shareholders or key management with minority ownership can still retain control over company board directors and major decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has allowed companies with dual-class shares to list since April this year; Singapore followed in June, in the face of competition from exchanges in the United States that have long allowed such listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only two mainland China companies with dual-class shareholding structures have listed in Hong Kong so far: Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone supplier; and food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Yonts, head of environment, social and governance and power research at CLSA, a joint sponsor of Xiaomi's US$4.72 billion initial public offering this year, said its analysts had "marked down” Xiaomi on "fairness” when giving it a score, which was "in line” with the average score given to mainland Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asia Corporate Governance Association, said Hong Kong and Singapore's lead over other Asian markets would have been three to four points higher, had they not allowed dual-class share listings.The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threatCLSA, Asia Corporate Governance Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he believed the two cities would be able to maintain their edge, as there was no sign yet that lower ranked but close rivals Malaysia and Taiwan would follow suit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the problem in Malaysia is, if they start losing some of their technology companies to Singapore, Hong Kong or the US, then clearly there will be pressure on them. It really depends on what happens in the next six to 12 months, in terms of where some of their companies choose to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said he was worried that a "contagion” had already started, and gave the example of South Korea signalling this year an interest in allowing small businesses and venture start-ups to issue dual-class shares, to encourage more small technology companies to list on the Kosdaq second board market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was ranked by the association on the basis of "original and independent research”, with no input from outside respondents to 121 questions it designed to assess a country's corporate governance. The questions cover government policies, regulatory rules and enforcement, investors' participation in corporate governance and corporate audit standards, besides society and media monitoring. The association also incorporated findings from an in-depth look at disclosure and governance practices of 25 large and mid-capitalisation stocks in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, meanwhile, used a "bottom-up” approach by examining 1,100 listed companies' governance in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said Hong Kong's move to set up an independent regulator for the audit industry next year is positive, but bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> had not gone far enough in its recent corporate governance code revamp, on issues including gender diversity and limits on the number of corporate boards individual directors are allowed to sit on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, the trial of so-called mixed ownership in state companies - private and state capital - had yielded mixed results, said Allen. The reform would fare better on the governance front if private funds were allowed to invest in units spun off from state-owned enterprises, and appoint representatives in their independent new boards, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class shares listing rules must reform to protect investors and prevent an erosion of corporate governance, the </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of people think that because dual-class shares structures work in other jurisdictions it will immediately, effortlessly translate into an APAC context,” said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1">. "We are trying to challenge some of those preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's listing rules changed in April to allow companies with dual-class shares to float on the bourse, giving founders and key management stronger voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Western countries, including the US, have had such rules in place for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, Tokyo implemented the change in 2015 and Singapore in June, but no companies have listed so far in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has traditionally been defined by a "one-share, one-vote” system, meaning all shareholders enjoy proportional representation in company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Hong Kong could not offer </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> a dual-class structure was thought to be a strong reason the Chinese tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014, and was indicative of the city losing out as an IPO destination. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms - aimed at attracting tech companies who want to maximise valuation and see their founders' vision through - have drawn two of the city's biggest tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi raised HK$54 billion (US$4.7 billion), while in September Beijing-based online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised HK$52.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in a survey carried out by </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> in March this year, 97 per cent of their members in Asia-Pacific believed safeguards were needed to protect investors from a few controlling stakeholders, according to a report published on Tuesday, named "Dual-class Shares: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong already offers an "event-based sunset”, where founders' stronger voting rights collapse if they leave the company or transfer shares. But more is needed, argued CFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global association of investment professionals recommended a mandatory "time-based sunset” where super voting rights will collapse to regular shareholder voting rights after no longer than five years post-IPO, to protect investors from a lack of control in their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insufficient investor protection was noted by 53 per cent of respondents as a key risk of dual-class shares, while 52 per cent highlighted the skewed proportionality between ownership and control, and 28 per cent identified an erosion of corporate governance standards.The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountableMary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountable,” said Leung. "No matter what public shareholders want, there is a limitation to what they can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the structure may make sense at the time of IPO, we don't believe it should carry on forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> of 157 dual-class structure IPOs in the US since the early 2000s found companies with ongoing weighted voting rights and those that allowed collapsed super voting rights, had similar valuations in the first two years after floating. From the third year, however, companies with collapsed voting rights began trading at a higher valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CFA respondents were also worried about their lack of education on how to invest in companies with dual-class share structures. The survey founds 60 per cent said they had no experience investing in such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some argue we don't need rules as we are all grown ups, in Asia because there is so much retail investment in the market when things go wrong, they look to the regulators,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Are we set up in the right way to look after these people? Investors must of course do due diligence on what they are buying, but a great deal of work can be done to raise awareness and education levels.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the SFC, say they will work together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for new economy companies, adding momentum to the proposed new stock market for dual class shares after regulators embraced a water down version of listing reforms on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform should not be seen as a power struggle between the SFC and HKEX. The two regulators and the government all want to work together to upgrade the quality of Hong Kong markets and to see that the market operates more efficiently,” said James Lau, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the listing reform package, the Securities and Futures Commission agreed to abandon its controversial proposal last year for a frontline role in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central listing approval process will remain in the hands of HKEX and its listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC also agreed to abandon a proposal to review the performance of listing division staff. The responsibility will instead remain part of the purview of HKEX executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not a climb down which is a wrong way to describe the conclusion. We are listening to comments and consider the current approach more effective,” said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The conclusion will clarify the roles of SFC and HKEX in vetting new listings. Many problems happen after companies get listed. This is why post-listing enforcement is important,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will retain its role in setting listing policies, while a 12 member advisory panel will support the listing committee in setting policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government and the SFC and the stock exchange are open minded to carefully study how to carry out reforms to make sure our market could attract new economies to list here while at the same time we protect the interest of investors,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The water downed listing reforms come after a five-month controversial consultation last year, which received 8,500 submissions from brokers, listed companies and financial professionals. Ninety-four per cent of respondents were against the proposed reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said the listing reform result was a blow to the SFC and a victory for the HKEX and would likely help pave way for the launch of a third board supporting dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 the HKEX pushed for a consultation process on whether to launch dual class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX completed a two month consultation on the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board was among the top agenda items at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in August, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are listed in the US under a dual class share structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange operator has scrapped a planned consultation to expand listing reforms that would allow corporate investors to own stakes in companies that have a so-called dual-class shares structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision is a further setback for the sweeping reforms, which have so far failed to generate the much hoped-for slew of applications from big technology firms eager to raise capital on the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange introduced new rules in April to allow companies with dual-class shareholding rights, or weighted voting rights, to list here. The reform allows individual founders or certain key executives of these companies to own shares that carry more voting rights than those of other shareholders. The move was aimed at attracting more technology companies, which tend to favour this structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) had said initially it would launch a separate consultation by July 31 on whether it should also allow companies to own the special voting-class shares. The bourse, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that this consultation would not be launched after all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said: “Given that the current weighted voting-rights regime has only recently been put in place, the exchange believes it should deliberate further the extended weighted voting-rights regime and should continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to develop a broader consensus on the subject matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the exchange has decided not to launch a corporate weighted voting-rights consultation at this time as initially planned. The exchange will update the market on the subject in due course.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief expects more IPOs under Hong Kong's new listing regime after summer break[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2146645/hkex-chief-expects-more-ipos-under-hong-kongs-new-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marks another setback for the biggest overhaul of the local bourse's listing rules in 25 years, which was carried out amid high hopes that it would attract technology giants with dual-class shares as well as biotech firms that are yet to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Almost three months on, only two companies with the dual-class shareholding structure - smartphone maker Xiaomi and online food-delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> - have applied for listing. Hangzhou-based </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in mainland China, is the only pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing, and is set to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is somewhat disappointing,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector. “We would like to see the HKEX continue its listing reform to accept diversified companies to list, including those with different shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it may be a good move to slow down the pace to allow more parties to discuss further on the reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiaomi's recent IPO not living up to its expectations of raising US$10 billion and some Chinese tech firms opting to float their shares in the US and Shanghai, Hong Kong could only maintain its No 3 global IPO ranking in the first half, unchanged from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong retail investors give Xiaomi's IPO the cold shoulder, put off by high financing cost and valuation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced earlier this month they would not allow dual-class shareholding companies listed in Hong Kong to be traded by mainlanders via the stock connect schemes, a further blow to the effectiveness of the listing reforms. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiao-jia flew to Beijing last week to negotiate, and the three bourses agreed to look at when dual-class companies might be allowed to trade via the stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, supported the HKEX decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The dual-class shareholding listing reform was only launched three months ago. The market participants and investors still need time to digest the reform. It would be too soon to launch another consultation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX would be better off focusing on working with the mainland regulators to sort out the issue of mainlanders being able to trade the dual-class shares via the stock connect. That would be more important than making further changes to the listing reform.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore's effort to score the 2018 listing of state oil giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> - expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering - is the latest show of its ambition to develop an elite global exchange, but analysts say a lack of liquidity in the Lion City should mean Hong Kong will hold firm as Asia's top bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fierce courtship of Aramco has brought into focus how the region's exchanges are dangling new carrots to attract multibillion-dollar listings that have dried up since the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba in 2014 - the largest to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One incentive being considered in Singapore and Hong Kong is an easing of the one-share, one-vote orthodoxy in order to accommodate technology companies that prefer dual-class share structures in which the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco, which is planning an initial listing of just five per cent of its equity in 2018, has so far not shown an interest in dual-class shares, but Singapore is offering other sweeteners. These include the possibility that GIC, one of the city state's two sovereign wealth funds, could become a cornerstone investor. On February 2, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom was considering concurrent listings of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With its estimated oil reserves of 265 billion barrels - or 15 per cent of the world's proven reserves - the company is expected to be valued at around US$2 trillion. A five per cent flotation would raise US$100 billion, four times the amount raised by Alibaba, the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco's share offer is the centrepiece of the influential Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's strategy to attract foreign investment and wean the country off its dependence on oil revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market observers said the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX), the city state's sole stock market operator, would be looking to differentiate itself from the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (NYSE) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) by touting the island nation's neutral stance in geopolitics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US President Donald Trump's erratic Middle East foreign policy, coupled with legislation passed last year that allows victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, are seen in some quarters as factors that could deter Aramco from listing on the NYSE. With Hong Kong, questions remain over the extent of the city's legal autonomy from Beijing, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The biggest case for Singapore to woo Aramco would be that it is a truly neutral ground compared to everywhere else,” said Song Seng Wun, a Singapore-based economist with CIMB Private Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On purely market-based factors, however, the Singapore exchange is unlikely to upstage its bigger counterpart in Hong Kong any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily value of shares traded in the Lion City in January was S$1.05 billion (HK$5.74 billion), about a 10th of the HK$57.2 billion worth of shares traded in Hong Kong over the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total market capitalisation of SGX in 2016 was S$926 billion (HK$5.06 trillion), compared with HK$24.8 trillion in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore is just a smaller, niche market with limited liquidity compared to Hong Kong,” said Song, the Singapore-based economist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eddie Wong, partner of capital markets services at PwC in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong had an advantage over its regional rivals because of its deep ties with the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People [on the mainland] like doing deals in a familiar place and with people they know,” Wong said. Apart from mainland Chinese firms, South Asian companies were also increasingly showing interest in being listed in Hong Kong, Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An endemic lack of liquidity and the difficulty in luring Chinese IPOs away from Hong Kong are just two of several obstacles the SGX is facing. Its ambition of being an “Asian Gateway” is increasingly under threat by the rising stature of other Southeast Asian bourses like the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the </span><span class="s3">Indonesia Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, and Malaysia's Bursa Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite falling global deal volumes, Asian exchanges are likely to see an uptick in flotations as “it is relatively early days for many of the equity markets in Asia including mainland China and many Southeast Asian markets,” said David Erickson, the former co-head of global equity markets at </span><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ace up Singaporean stock market regulators' sleeves could be the introduction of dual class shares before the city's rivals. Technology start-ups have shown a preference for such tiered stocks, but critics charge that they give founders outsized control cheaply and disadvantage minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on Alibaba's IPO because the Chinese e-commerce giant was adamant on a tiered share structure that the city's rules do not permit. SGX was edged out by the NYSE for the 2012 IPO of English football giant </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> for the same reason. The city state has not had a multibillion-dollar IPO since the 2011 listing of </span><span class="s3">Hutchison Port Holdings Trust</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye in January said the exchange would soon launch a public consultation on permitting dual class shares. HKEX chief Li Xiaojia, meanwhile, has said the exchange will launch a similar exercise. The Hong Kong had plans to relaunch dual class shares in 2015 (they have been banned in the city since 1989) but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> shot down the idea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If Singapore goes ahead with the plan, I am afraid it will be a race to the bottom. Hong Kong will not be able to resist the political pressure to [introduce dual-class shares] and both markets will hurt themselves,” said Jamie Allen, the Hong Kong-based secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. “It goes against the principle of fairness...dual-class structures are unfair to minority shareholders,” said Allen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuck Seng Tham, capital markets leader at PwC in Singapore, said risks associated with tiered share structures could be “properly managed instead of avoided, with the appropriate safeguards”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said Singapore and Hong Kong were unlikely to make a decision on dual-class shares by the end of this year. ■</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies chairman, Francis Leung Pak-to, also known as “father of red chips” said on Monday that the chamber supported the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed separate board to list dual class share companies here, but not new start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has just ended a consultation last Friday for the third board's establishment, whose listing requirements differ from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, essentially aimed at providing a listing venue for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two platforms: a premium market that is open to all investors and will host companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but have a dual-class share structure which the exchange currently disallows. The second is for start-ups where only professional investors can invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung was opposed to the start-up board for the high risks that entailed. “Many start-ups lack track records and have a high risk of failure. They are not suitable to be traded on the stock exchange,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He supported however, the launch of a separate board only for the dual class shares with a market capitalisation of HK$8 billion, which is similar to a so-called unicorn new economy firm valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list here,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are plenty of mainland “unicorns” which would be interested to list in Hong Kong, but our market needs to prepare itself for these companies. This is why we would need this new board that accept dual class share companies to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many big technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are dual class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than the others. Hong Kong bans such types of companies to list but US allows it, which has led mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to go for a listing in New York in 2014, instead of Hong Kong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list hereFrancis Leung Pak-to, Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Three years after losing Alibaba and our market still has done nothing to address the issue. We need to make sure our market can capture these companies to list. This is why we need to introduce the third board soon,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I introduced the red chips in Hong Kong in the 1990s, there were many criticisms that these companies are different from other H-shares. But then, we have many successful listings - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Citic, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> - and they are still heavily traded by investors,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A red chip is a company incorporated in Hong Kong but has a mainland parent, which is different from an H-share company which is established in the mainland but listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also against the HKEX's proposal to let US-listed mainland companies seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This rule will turn Hong Kong into a second-tier market as most big players will go list in the US and then seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. We oppose to this proposal,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> has opposed to dual class share listings as they reduce the ability for fund managers to exercise their voting rights to decide on the remuneration, director appointments and other important corporate affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund body said the development of dual class shares were “negative” to investor protection and urged the exchange to stick to “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange said it will explore ways to encourage start-ups and technology companies to raise capital in the city, conceding the need to tweak existing listing rules to compete with Singapore and New York to be the hub for initial stock offers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388%20&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], at a luncheon with more than 100 of the city's brokers and fund managers.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the listing advisory committee at rival </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> approved a plan to allow companies with dual-class shares to raise funds, in a move that makes the city more appealing to technology start-ups that often feature stocks with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class structure has been the subject of intense debate in Hong Kong since the bourse in 2014 missed out on a US$25 billion initial public offer by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has a dual-class structure that allows founding shareholders to nominate up to half the company's board of directors even as they own minority shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong hasn't allowed such a structure since the 1980s because the city's Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the market regulator, believes dual-class shares violate the “one share, one vote” principle and are unfair to other investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba eventually listed its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US stock market allows dual-class shares, favoured by technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">LinkedIn</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the world's largest destination for IPOs from 2009 to 2011, but lost that pole position to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2014, due to Alibaba's listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addressing the annual gathering of stockbrokers, Li neither specifically addressed the subject of allowing dual-class structure in Hong Kong, nor bring up competition with Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have our own plan and our own strategies and we will explore all possibilities,” he said. “Other stock exchanges do their own thing and we will not respond to what another exchange is doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake for Hong Kong could be another large stock offer by other startups including Alibaba's online payments unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, which investment bankers estimate could be valued as much as US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's founder Ma told the University of Macau students in June that he “very much hopes” to list </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which operates the Alipay electronic payments platform, in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With big Chinese technology and internet initial public offerings potentially in the pipeline, Hong Kong's decision to revamp its IPO rules could tip the balance in its favour as it battles for China listings with New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies are increasingly more positive on Hong Kong as a preferred listing destination,” said Mervyn Chow, the co-head of investment banking and capital markets, Asia-Pacific, and Greater China chief executive at Credit Suisse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said on Friday it would propose rule changes to allow dual-class shares on the main board, with a formal public consultation to be launched as early as the first quarter of 2018. The overhaul in listing regulations could be the city's most drastic in three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rule changes to allow dual-class shares will enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness vis-a- vis the US, especially for Chinese technology IPOs. It is the right timing for Hong Kong to make these changes. It will be a game changer,” Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a group of rapidly expanding Chinese technology and internet companies nears the stage of going public, the battle for big Chinese listings has intensified between Hong Kong and its fundraising rivals, such as New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the privately owned Chinese smartphone maker, has been in talks with investment banks for a possible IPO as soon as next year, which might value the company at more than US$50 billion, versus a valuation of US$46 billion at its most recent funding round in 2014, according to media reports. Either Hong Kong or New York could host the listing, the reports said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If valued at US$50 billion, Xiaomi's float will be the third-largest technology IPO in history, surpassing Snap's US$24 billion listing in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> , which owns the South China Morning Post, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> rank No. 1 and No. 2, with valuations of US$167 billion and US$104 billion, respectively, when they were listed in 2014 and 2012 in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> , has also invited investment banks to handle its planned listing next year, which could value the unit at US$10 billion, Bloomberg reported recently, citing unnamed sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has already seen a flurry of fundraising in 2017 by technology and internet companies, with five of its 10 largest IPOs by companies operating in the new economy, compared with none last year. Listings by banks and securities companies, staples of Hong Kong's capital market, have halved to 30 per cent of this year's top IPOs, from 60 per cent last year, in line with regulators' goals to draw more new economy companies to float here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, Tencent's China Literature debuted on the Hong Kong market, and its US$1.06 billion IPO attracted overwhelming investor demand, in what was the hottest listing in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other potential technology IPOs in the forthcoming year could include: </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Company of China's peer-to-peer online-lending platform Lufax, which could raise up to US$5 billion in a planned Hong Kong IPO as soon as the first half of 2018; its Chinese rival Dianrong.com, backed by Singapore's GIC, which is also considering a Hong Kong listing to raise least US$500 million; as well as Hong Kong's online finance lending platform WeLab, with a possible listing size of US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu's video streaming site </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is targeting an IPO as soon as next year, to value it at up to US$10 billion, with New York a possible listing destination, according to reports this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is Hong Kong's IPO fever over after Nissin and Shandong Trust fail to excite? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> , the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> fintech affiliate that operates Alipay, has delayed its IPO. Jack Ma Yun , the Alibaba chairman, said last month he would possibly consider an IPO for </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> in two years, but not in the next 12 to 18 months. The venue for this listing is also undecided. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> was valued at US$60 billion in its last funding round in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> 's Chow said Chinese issuers usually prefer a Hong Kong listing, as it is closer to their home market and enables access to a larger pool of international as well as mainland investors, who typically have a good understanding of the business models and the products that tend to be relevant locally. “This has been important for Chinese technology firms, which are largely ‘product companies' focused on building and selling products to consumers.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the proposed move to a dual-class share structure, more innovative companies might choose Hong Kong as a listing destination. Moreover, the changes might bring new opportunities for investors, which would boost the liquidity of the city's capital market, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These opportunities include new IPO products, such as potentially a trading link to enable mainland investors to buy into Hong Kong IPOs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital, said he had already seen a rising willingness among his clients in China to favour Hong Kong as an IPO destination. Wan said he expected the first dual-class share company to appear on the Hong Kong market as early as the second half of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year we've had several hot tech IPOs, such as ZhongAn Online, China Literature and Razer, which have ignited investors' enthusiasm towards new-economy stocks and raised expectations about more tech and internet listings coming to Hong Kong, such as the highly anticipated IPOs of Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> ,” said Kenny Shui, a senior researcher at Our Hong Kong Foundation, a Hong Kong-based think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a key issue would be how Hong Kong can protect retail investors at the same time, as dual-class shares give company founders much more power over their business even if they hold a small portion of the shares, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have had a number of pre-IPO enquiries relating to the new listing regime,” said an HKEX spokeswoman.“We expect potential issuers and their consultants will file formal applications in due course.The listing regime is a standing facility and potential issuers don't need to rush to file applications on the first day.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government has signalled that it intends to drop a plan to establish a new board on the city's stock exchange for start-ups and companies with multiple-class shareholding structures to raise capital, choosing instead to amend existing rules to allow these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is likely reach a consensus with the Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SEC) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) in the next few weeks, and publish a conclusion of the public consultations that have taken place over the proposed new board, said James Lau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have looked at both possibilities” of whether to introduce so-called weighted voting rights, or multiple-class structure, on the proposed board or the main board, Lau said. “The chance is higher on the main board.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The unexpected comment is the first sign that the Hong Kong government, years after agonising over how best to retain and attract so-called new economy companies to raise capital in Asia's largest destination for initial public offers, is now preparing to step away from the plan. What changed was the successful IPO last month by Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$1.5 billion on the city's stock exchange, even as its profit track record didn't meet the main board's requirement of a combined profit of HK$50 million in the three years before listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's market ranked third among global destinations for IPOs in the first three quarters of this year, with 106 companies raising a combined HK$85 billion in the city, according to Deloitte's data. That compares with the whole of last year, when 71 IPOs raised HK$134.3 billion (US$17.2 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's brokers, bankers and regulators had been divided over how best to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> -- the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post -- abandon the local bourse to stage its record US$25 billion IPO in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue was a voting structure among the company's founding shareholders that gave them veto power over the appointment of directors, a special right that contravenes Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle. Ever since, Hong Kong had been debating whether to allow companies with dual-class shares, a common feature among technology companies from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> to Snapchat, to list on the exchange, or establish a new board to cater for them. The New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> bourses allow these dual-class stocks to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/2aca847a-b7ed-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_image_hires_203112.JPG]In June, HKEX proposed to set up a new board, or so-called “Third Board”, as part of its broader market reform. The new board will permit dual-class shares, a structure designed to give specific shareholders more voting power than others. Shares in one class carry one vote, while shares in another carry multiple votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over these past few years, we have all observed a better trend in the development of this particular sector and do have a better grasp of the future direction,” Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said today during a taxation forum. “So under different sets of circumstances now, if we can have a proper safeguard design and have them put in place, allowing companies with weighted corporate structures to be listed is not impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move has been regarded as part of the exchange's efforts to woo more technology and emerging companies amid growing competition for initial public offerings among global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal's public consultations ended last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, media reports said HKEX plans to highlight four points in the conclusion of public consultations, which could pave the way for a potential next round of consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four points include supporting the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, making rule changes to the main board instead of setting up a new board, scrapping the establishment of a new listing segment targeting tech start-ups, and adding new rules to attract emerging companies such as biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, the HKEX proposed to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multiple classes of shares among their shareholders may be allowed to raise capital in Hong Kong by the middle of 2018, as the city's Securities&amp;Futures Commission (SFC) backs away from its position on the "One Share, One Vote" principle, which has been a pillar of the local capital market since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A pilot scheme will be launched next year, whereby certain start-up companies that have attained the so-called unicorn status - valuations exceeding US$1 billion - will be allowed to raise capital on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange through initial public offerings, if they put in place sufficient investor protection provisions, two sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The protection provisions may include a sunset clause that compels the companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stocks listed under this pilot programme will also need to be designated with a special code to distinguish them from other listed companies, for reminding investors to be aware of potential risks, the source said. The pilot plan could be widened if sufficient number of high-quality companies are attracted to Hong Kong without regulatory problems, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's about-turn is a major step forward in helping Hong Kong compete with global capital markets including New York, Singapore and Shanghai, especially in attracting technology and new economy companies to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for companies to raise funds this year, falling behind New York and Shanghai. Between January and June, the city's stock market raised US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, a drop of 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised in the same period in 2016, when it was ranked as the leader for new listings worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> pushed for a consultation to launch dual-class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections by the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the SFC in 2014 opposed exemption for </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, to list in Hong Kong. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source said the SFC was supporting Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who in August signalled the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC and the government also want to see dual-class shares listed on the main board instead of a proposed separate board, as they do not want to see a fragmented market structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange is likely to announce the pilot scheme in the coming weeks, the second source said. It will hold a second round of detailed rule changes for this pilot scheme before dual-class shares can be listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may amend its listing rules to accept companies with dual class shares and biotech companies with no revenue as early as late April, accelerating the timeline for the widely-expected listing regime change by several months, the bourse operator said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January predicted the listing rules could be amended from June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We bring the reform forward to late April as it would allow the listing of these companies in the summer period when June to August are active months,” Li said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have discussed this reform for a long time and a lot of issues have consensus already. We do not need the normal two months of consultation and could speed the process up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange on Friday issued a consultation paper detailing the proposed rule changes that will enable some companies with multiple-class share structures to list on the Hong Kong stock market, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation will last for one month, officially drawing to a close on March 23, while the consultation conclusion would be made in late April, officials said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Upon the issuance of the consultation conclusion and the implementation of the listing rules, the exchange will accept formal applications under the new regime,” the exchange said. Companies are welcome to make informal inquiries to the exchange ahead of the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few months we have collectively decided to take a big step forwards as a financial centre and welcome emerging and innovative companies. Now we are proposing a listing regime that will boost Hong Kong's attractiveness for a new generation of companies as well as investors, bringing more dynamism to our stock market,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said he supported the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The proposals are reasonable and can offer shareholder protection. It is particularly important that biotech companies must not change their principal business without prior approval by the exchange,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the HKEX, following an industry consultation, decided to proceed with reforms to allow dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, as long as the companies have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$10 billion (US$1.29 billion) and annual revenue of HK$1 billion. Companies that have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion would be exempt from the revenue requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our new secondary listing regime welcome both Chinese and international companies to apply,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies already listed under the dual-class share structure such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> or Baidu in the US, could apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong while maintaining their current structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If their share trading volume exceeds 55 per cent in Hong Kong, they could be classed as a dual primary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech companies taking advantage of the new listing regime would need to have a minimum market cap of HK$1.5 billion and be limited to sophisticated investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the exchange did not accept calls made by some fund managers for a sunset clause that would see the dual class structure expire after a period of years, or undergo a general vote by shareholders for renewal. The exchange said the rule would be too restrictive and prompt companies to look towards other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A sunset clause with an expiry date would create uncertainty for both companies and investors. It would be difficult for the companies to have long term development,” Li said. “It is also hard to determine what time frame would be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among safeguards to protect minority investors, some shareholder votes would be conducted on the basis of one share one vote. This would apply to issues involving the appointment and removal of independent directors and auditors, changes to constitutional documents, changes to the rights of any class of shares, and the winding up of the company, the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual class shares will have a “W” stock marker while biotech firms will have a “B” at the end of their share name to help investors identify their features.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is up for another round of market reform as the stock exchange will solicit views from the public at the end of the month for a new board to allow more technology firms like Alipay and Lufax, as well as foreign giant companies such as </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchange is at the final stage of preparation in the details of this new board. We hope to have the consultation about launching this new board by the end of May,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which runs the stock and futures exchanges in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the sideline of the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> Week Asia forum on Wednesday, Li said they were keen to have a bigger variety of companies to list here, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO that is expected to raise US$100 billion, in a 5 per cent stake sale of the oil giant valued at US$2 trillion. Hong Kong is in the running for the listing, but is facing competition from London and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new market which brokers call the third board, will be the third market in Hong Kong after the Main Board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said in January that the new board would have different listing rules from the other two markets to allow more foreign firms, infrastructure firms, overseas companies on the “Belt and Road Initiative”, technology or new-economy companies, and firms that want to be listed in a dual-class shareholding structure, to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX rekindles plans for dual-class share structure in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2063569/hkex-rekindles-plans-dual-class-share-structure-city]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be a good idea for the HKEX to launch a new board to attract more technology firms to list. Hong Kong has many big banks and financial giants to list, but we have too few technology companies listings here,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector, and is himself a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firms. This would be better than changing the rules for the main board and the GEM,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung however, said the consultation needed to also offer suggestions to safeguard the interests of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We also want the HKEX to have good communication with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, for the regulator to support the reform. We do not want to repeat the chaos two years ago when the stock exchange proposed rule change on dual shareholding structure, and the plan was rejected by the SFC immediately,” he said.A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firmsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many new-economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares with a dual-share structure as their founders tend to hold on to a minority stake but want to retain control. Dual-share structures allow certain shareholders to have more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York over Hong Kong in 2014, as the SFC considers its shareholding structure to be a dual-class shareholding that is banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US. Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called Hong Kong listing rules outdated, that they do not meet the needs of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pain of Alibaba loss prompts HKEX to examine new measures[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2012339/pain-alibaba-loss-prompts-hkex-examine-new-measures]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the plan a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time would be different as the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing last month said the commission had agreed to a consultation on the third board, including the dual-class share proposal. The change in attitude was because the type of listings would be limited to the new board, while the previous proposal applied to the entire market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, HKEX would face an uphill battle to convince all stakeholders to accept the dual-class shareholding structure. Many fund mangers such as </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> and Templeton Franklin are opposed to it as they consider the structure unfair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be good to have a new market in Hong Kong to attract different types of companies to list here. But as usual, devil is in the details. We need to see if the HKEX proposals are flexible enough to attract new technology companies to list here, while at the same time, that there is sufficient investor protection,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Stockbrokers Association chairman Benny Mau said if the HKEX would propose a third board, it would need to clearly define how the role and listing requirements are different from those for the main board and the GEM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The consultation paper should also consult the market if all investors could invest in this new board or if it should be for institutional investors to trade only,” Mau said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) expects to let the first company with a dual-class share structure list in the second half of this year as it looks to complement the Chinese onshore and Asian capital markets in allowing tech firms to raise funds, bourse officials told a media briefing in Hong Kong on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX said that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong are planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a have a dual-class listing structure that has operations in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Chinese companies make up 20 per cent of the market cap of companies listed in Singapore, according to Chew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We see ourselves playing an offshore complementary role to the emerging markets in Asia and that includes China and to a certain extent Hong Kong companies that are looking to expand overseas,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is expected to release its dual class share rules in the coming weeks and aims to be a lot more freer than other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, if you list an IPO in Hong Kong, the cornerstone investor is expected to be locked up for six months, but Singapore will not have that issue,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore may provide value when it come to the Chinese companies expanding their international business, and is likely to continue to attract consumer, tech, health care, REITs and infrastructure companies that want to extend their “overseas ambitions”, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly 40 per cent of all companies listed on SGX are international and account for more than 50 per cent of total market cap. Whereas only 6 per cent of all companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange are non-Chinese companies, according to data from the two exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's revamped IPO rules will take effect soon, allowing start-ups valued at US$1.5 billion to list shares under a dual-class shares scheme.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore is a more international market than Hong Kong in terms of investors and companies that raise capital, Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it is a Chinese focused technology business Hong Kong does better; we acknowledge that. But when it is pan-Asia business and Southeast Asia business then we a little bit better off,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese technology businesses developing international applications and looking to expand such as into South East Asia and South Asia under China's Belt and Road Initiative may choose Singapore to obtain better valuations and attention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International investors from the US, Japan and Korea that want to invest in emerging Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia but cannot get access to the markets directly could also use Singapore to invest into these companies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing reforms, due to kick-start later this month, are likely to attract more technology firms to list on its stock exchange - but only as long as the authorities can provide appropriate investor protection measures, the head of leading global fund manager Janus Henderson Investors has cautioned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, is now in a race with counterparts in mainland China, Singapore and the US to compete for new technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what's expected to be the largest listings shake-up in Hong Kong for three decades, dual-class shareholdings are likely to be included for tech and biotech companies without strict requirements on revenues and profit.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a structure will allow one class of shareholders to own more voting right than others, an arrangement favoured by many founders keen to maintain control while still holding minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move comes after more than two years of consultation, and remains controversial, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While HKEX and many tech firms want to change the rules to allow them to list here, many fund houses oppose the change as they would violate the city's long-held “one share, one vote” principle, and may hurt the interest of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major UK investor Aberdeen Standard Investments, for instance, does not favour these kinds of company listings, due to corporate governance concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1">, the fund industry's controlling body in the city, has also called on HKEX to require dual class shareholding companies to appoint more independent board directors, to safeguard the interests of fund companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Andrew Formica, Janus Henderson's co-chief executive, has now come out and said his company would invest in these companies, but only with the caveat they have good corporate governance standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will the introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong boost Chinese tech shares listed in US?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2131905/will-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong-kong-boost-chinese-tech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is on track to lose its much-coveted crown as the world's top initial public offering (IPO) market as the year draws to a close, with latest figures showing total funds raised here have dropped 48 per cent compared with 12 months ago, leaving the city ranked third behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPO funding raised by 67 companies on the main board of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) this year stood at US$12.29 billion as of Wednesday, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">, compared with US$23.72 billion at the same stage of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York's 67 IPOs raised US$28.93 billion and Shanghai saw 197 companies raise US$18.69 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The disappointing Hong Kong result comes even after a recent flurry of new listings in the past two months - but even those failed to turn the tide in its favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has been the top IPO market for the past two years, but a lack of real blockbuster new listings and its failure especially to attract tech firms, have been blamed for getting kicked it off its perch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan has already announced a consultation paper will be launched by HKEX in the first quarter of next year on plans to examine allowing dual class stock listings - a type favoured by many technology or new economy companies - which it hopes will help reverse its fortunes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/06/cdf36ba2-da44-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_161237.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual class stock is the issuing of normally two types of shares by a single company, possibly offering more voting rights or dividend per share than other classes of shareholdings. That is the type favoured by tech giants </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share class might be offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives or family. The class offered to the general public has limited voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides them majority control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is allowed in the US, but has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the world's largest IPO this year raised US$3.91 billion, adopted a dual class shareholding structure for its offering in New York. Its stock exchange had three IPO among the top 10 in the year-to-date, including two hi-tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market, in contrast, is still dominated by "old economy" financial firms, seven of which make up its top 10 largest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> was Hong Kong's largest IPO this year raising HK$16.5 billion (US$2.22 billion), which was also the only domestic listing to squeeze into the global top 10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other more-recent heavyweight HK floats have come from China's largest online car retailer </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (US$866), gaming device maker Razer (US$524m), China Literature (US$1.06b), China's largest online publishing and e-book site, a unit of Tencent, and ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance (US$1.52b), China's first online-only insurer backed by Alibaba affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> .[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs to fight for both old and new economy companies to list here," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for financial services sector who is also a broker, "so as such, we should allow companies with dual class shareholding structure to be listed".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we would need to add in a number of measures to safeguard the interest of investors," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested, for instance, having sunset clauses - regulations that can automatically be abolishing - and possible expiry dates on adopting such a structure. One sunset clause might be the company would have the option to delist, if the founder or key management members were to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norm Champ, a partner at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, and the former director of investment management at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it would be "smart" for</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong to change its listing regime to allow dual class share structures, given the fierce IPO market worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SEC and the </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> are also very keen on getting more companies to list in New York by easing the disclosure regulations," said Champ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the actual number of listed companies in the US has fallen by half over the past two decades as many companies stayed private, or delisted, to escape the expense and scrutiny of being public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SEC may also relax some regulations such as the disclosure of the pay ratio of the chief executive to other employees, Champ said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The IPO market has bounced back in the US this year, and that trend is likely to continue."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New economy companies seeking to list dual-class shares in Hong Kong could be eligible to apply by the end of June, according to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-stock-exchange] (HKEx) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a listing reform plan announced last month, HKEx will allow biotech firms without revenue and other large new economy companies with dual-class shares to list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said a six- to eight-week consultation on the rule change will begin in February after the Lunar New Year[https://www.scmp.com/topics/lunar-new-year] holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If all goes well, we hope all the rule changes would be ready in early June and we can start to accept applications for listing from new economy and biotech companies,” Li said on the sidelines of the Asian Financial Forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shareholding structure had been prohibited in Hong Kong since the mid-1980s. These share structures are favoured by technology companies such as Facebook[https://www.scmp.com/topics/facebook] or Alphabet as they enable founders to maintain control of the company even though they only hold a minority of the listed shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ban on the dual-share structure is believed to be one of the main reasons why the city lost out when mainland Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for New York in its record US$25 billion IPO in 2014[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1599023/alibaba-ipo-size-boosted-after-it-took-walk].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to identify which companies have contacted the exchange since the proposed rule change, although mainland handset maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] is rumoured to be among the candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said he also welcomed US-listed new economy companies seeking a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the HKEx proposal unveiled in December, “innovative” Chinese companies with a market capitalisation of more than HK$10 billion (US$1.27 billion) will be eligible to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong as long as they have a primary on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, or </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba, Baidu[https://www.scmp.com/topics/baidu], and JD.com[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jd] are all very large Chinese new economy companies listed in the US,” Li said. “Our reform would allow these companies to list here. I cannot say if an individual company would decide to list in Hong Kong, but we can have a regulatory framework ready for them to consider to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] executive chairman Jack Ma Yun[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] last week said he would consider listing in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange] upon a request by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[https://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said he hoped an ETF connect and a derivate connect would launch this year, but cautioned that more progress on technical issues was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that the existing stock connect scheme had helped to pump up daily market turnover. In the first three weeks of the year turnover has risen to HK$130 billion, compared to HK$88.25 billion in 2017 and HK$66.92 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, recognising the competitive pressures the city faces in attracting listings by new economy companies, has thrown its weight behind the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed listing reform that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list here, its chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This confirmed a South China Morning Post report on the regulator's support for a change that will hopefully attract big mainland players such as Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is a competition issue. It is not just the US - the UK and Singapore also want to attract technology and new economy companies to list. Hong Kong needs to play catch up,” Tong said in a media briefing on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hoped at least one giant tech company would list here under the new rules by October 2018, when he retires after a six-year stint with the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong, while the tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu would consider secondary listings here after the new rule changes for dual-class share companies are introduced next year,” said Tong.“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong.”Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman, Securities and Futures Commission</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This follows the rejection in 2014 of a plan by e-commerce giant Alibaba to adopt a structure that would allow its founder, Jack Ma Yun, and key executives to appoint more than half of the company's board. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange in 2015 proposed to allow these companies to list but the proposal was scrapped following objections by the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> unveiled a proposal to allow giant technology companies with at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) to list with multiple classes of shares, and biotech companies with no revenue to list in Hong Kong after a rule change by mid next year. This time, Tong indicated his support but stressed that proper investor protection measures must be in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Let us be clear, we still believe that ‘one-share, one-vote' is the gold standard since it has never been proven that companies with weighted voting rights perform better in the long run. We do accept, however, that to attract new economy companies to list in Hong Kong and to make our market more vibrant, we need to change,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The challenge that Hong Kong faces is one of competition, which is fully supported by market statistics, he said. About 50 per cent of the mainland technology companies listed in the United States have multiple-class shareholding structures, versus only 17 per cent for non-mainland technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, only 8 per cent of mainland non-technology companies listed in the US have multiple-class shareholding structures, about the same level as non-mainland non-technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This suggests that mainland technology companies prefer weighted voting rights structures and if Hong Kong wants to attract these companies to list in its market, we have to find a way to accommodate those that we consider to be of substance and quality,” he said, adding that the commission will work closely with HKEX on safeguards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong also said one of the reasons for the commission's objection in 2015 was that due to large fund houses worries about these companies would be added to the benchmark index and, as such, passive fund managers would be forced to invest in them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Recently, both FTSE Russell and S&amp;P have decided to place restrictions on the admission of companies with weighted voting rights in their indices, although MSCI has decided to carry out further consultation,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, some large fund houses such as Black Rock rejected the idea of index providers restricting weighted voting rights companies from their index as they believe the fund houses should have the right to choose what companies to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They would rather see protective measures such as sunset clauses. Clearly, there has been a slow shift of mindset … accepting some form of weighted voting rights companies.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regard to the commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption</span><span class="s1"> (ICAC) joining hands to raid the offices of financial company Convoy Global, Tong declined to comment on the case but confirmed the commission would, where necessary, continue to collaborate with other regulators and enforcement agencies such as ICAC, Hong Kong Police and mainland regulator </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> in combating financial crimes to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said investors should be aware of market uncertainties in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Going into 2018, the capital market may face many uncertainties, including Brexit, geopolitical risks in North Korea and the Middle East, and the US interest rate rises,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US stock market may adjust itself and if it happens, it will affect the rest of the world, including Hong Kong, which has recorded substantial gains over the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would therefore like to remind investors that they need to be very cautious and prudent in making their investment decisions and to not take excessive risks.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will find it hard to attract secondary listings by mainland technology companies such as e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which are already listed in the United States, because of competition from China, Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Beijing's plan to introduce China depository receipts will be a big threat to Hong Kong. When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong Kong,” Leung said during a forum of the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will led to more new economy companies that have not yet listed to opt for listing in the US instead of Hong Kong, as they will think they can issue China depository receipts at a later stage.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is known as the “father of red chips”. As a well-known investment banker in the 1990s, he brought many red chips - companies with a mainland parent incorporated overseas - to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Those listed in the US already have exposure to international investors. The reason for them to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong is to capture mainland investors who trade these stocks via the stock connects. If China were to invite these companies to issue China depository receipts on the mainland, there is no point in them having a secondary listing here,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the China depository receipt requirements are very high, and only the very large companies will be invited by authorities to issue these in China. As such, companies that do not qualify will still like to list in Hong Kong after the listing reform,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Father of red chips' backs new board to attract unicorns, but not new start-ups[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2107680/father-red-chips-backs-new-board-attract-unicorns-not-new]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung added that mainland companies too wanted to list in Hong Kong, because they wanted to capture international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that faced with such competition, the Hong Kong stock exchange would need to be more proactive in its fight for such companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the local bourse operator, announced its biggest reform in 25 years on Tuesday. It will from Monday allow dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotechnology companies with no revenue to apply for listings here. Dual-class shareholding companies allow founders, or key management of the companies, to hold a premium class of shares that has higher voting rights than normal shareholders, a structure favoured by many technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Leung said the reform had not gone far enough. He said it was not right for the HKEX to require that premium class shareholders have the same voting rights as ordinary shareholders when they elect independent non-executive directors, or change articles of association.When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong KongFrancis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of allowing dual-class shareholding structure companies to list here is to allow the founders and key management to keep control over major issues even though they hold minority stakes. Waiving their special rights to appoint independent directors to the board will not reduce their influence on the board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX introduced this requirement to meet a demand by fund managers for added protection for investors. Leung, however, said the bourse operator should achieve balance to make sure founders and management have control.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed regulations on variable interest entities (VIEs) in a new draft of China's foreign investment law may put more obstacles in the way of companies with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong while encouraging e-commerce firms to incorporate in the Shanghai free-trade zone, lawyers and accountants said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies have been using VIE structures to list overseas, allowing foreign capital to get around Beijing's foreign ownership restrictions on some sectors, such as the internet industry. </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Baidu all use such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In some cases where [China] has imposed shareholding restrictions on foreign investments in certain industries, the VIE structures may shield the shareholders in real control," said Roy Lo Wa-kei, a deputy managing partner of accounting firm Shinewing. "The proposed law would require more disclosure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government could gather more data from VIE firms through the new regulation. But the risks for the companies would be they might have to reveal any practice of non-compliance covered by the VIE structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The draft of the foreign investment law published by the Ministry of Commerce would legitimise VIE structures but also require companies using such structures to prove they were ultimately controlled by Chinese investors, otherwise they would be treated as foreign-invested enterprises and might fall foul of a "negative list" of industries with foreign investment restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law is now in a consultation period, with the deadline for submitting comments on February 17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Haiwen &amp; Partners, a Beijing-based law firm, said the regulations on VIEs could lead to obstacles for firms with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are not yet listed, the clauses on [Chinese] investors selling stakes in offshore companies to foreign investors could be subject to restrictions in the law on foreign investments, such as foreign ownership," Haiwen said in a note to clients. "In some cases, the clauses could not be implemented, thus there may be legal obstacles if they want to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"More disclosure would also be required when they list in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are already listed, restrictions on the transfer of [mainland] shareholders' shares in foreign investment would severely reduce the liquidity of their shares, and affect the valuation of such companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, said Alibaba, Baidu and other firms with dual-class share structures would benefit in the proposed regulatory change as dual-class share structures could help keep the company founders in control, which in turn would ensure their firms were not deemed foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, companies such as Tencent, with VIE structures but without dual-class shares, might be treated as foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed law encourages companies to set up using a dual-class share structure," Gillis said. "Hong Kong does not permit such companies to list, which will be a huge win for New York."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US exchange permits dual-class share structures, which was why Alibaba listed in New York instead of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The consultation paper points to a positive direction that VIE structures will be formally recognised by the [mainland] government and governed by the proposed new legislation," a Tencent spokesman said. "As this is in the early stage of consultation, we are monitoring the progress closely."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In order not to loose access to the Chinese market due to the regulatory change, e-commerce companies without ultimate mainland control might want to incorporate in or move their VIEs to the Shanghai free-trade zone, which had indicated it would allow wholly owned foreign investment in e-commerce, Gillis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Weiss, another law firm preparing to submit comments on the draft law, said more clarity was needed on whether a company would be deemed to have ultimate Chinese control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For example, what if the [Chinese] and foreign investors both satisfy the control definition? What if a founder of a VIE structure has de facto control over the business but only holds a small minority interest in the foreign parent entity controlling the VIE structure and does not have special board appointment rights?" it said in a note to clients.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scramble by mainland China's two stock markets to lure foreign-funded technology firms is firmly back on track, as its financial regulators revisit their plan to create a fast track mechanism for share offerings by what many consider will be the profitmaking stars of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this time, their on-off-on-again plan - first revealed way back in 2001 - is set to have greater substance, say commentators, since the leadership is more determined than ever to inject some entrepreneurial vigour into the economy to drive long-term growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will ratchet up the pressure on Hong Kong, as a tug of war over listing resources gradually takes the strain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend it has prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting “unicorns” - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and has already visited to a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invited them to Shanghai, so they can gain first-hand experience (of our facilities and systems),” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are also reaching out to help them overcome difficulties in accessing the capital markets,” it added, without casting a light on any actual names.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's top securities regulators, including chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, confirmed last week too that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's own securities regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), and its stock exchange are also conducting the city's largest listing reforms in decades, aimed at enhancing the bourse's attractiveness to technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June, large biotech companies, for instance, without strong revenue track records as well as more mainstream technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures will be allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That dual-class share structure, will allow shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends, and is favoured by many tech founders as the majority hold minority stakes but still want to maintain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> (which owns the South China Morning Post) chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC quickly recognised the competitive pressures this put the city under in attracting listings by new-economy companies, and threw its weight last December behind its own proposed listing reforms, that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology firms being courted by both exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland have chosen to list A-shares only - yuan-denominated shares bought and traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges - because of the domestic market's higher valuations and the convenience,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expect to this see-saw game between the two markets[Hong Kong and the mainland] intensifying in coming years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, a would-be, fast track listing mechanism proposed to be launched in 2015 was seen as a winning formula which underlined its efforts to set up a dedicated board for emerging industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was put on ice after a summer stock market rout exacerbated regulator worries about a further slide in key economic indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That board was particularly designed to welcome relistings by privatised Chinese tech firms, which had previously traded in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Foxconn Industrial Internet - a unit of the world's largest contract manufacturer whose products include Apple's iPhones - received the go-ahead from the CSRC to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai, just five short weeks after it filed an application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The green light granted to the 27 billion yuan (US$4.27 billion) fundraising was the clearest sign yet that the CSRC is now prioritising technology IPOs as a way of bolstering the country's levels of technical innovation - a key component of the Chinese leadership's attempt to create an economy reliant on slower, but more sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the country's promising start-ups have been backed in the past by foreign private equity and venture capital funds, under the so-called VIE (variable interest entity) structure, and could only list in markets such as Hong Kong and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A VIE structure allows founders and investment funds to set up offshore vehicles which can sign contracts with Chinese firms, giving the latter effective control of the resultant offshore vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To woo VIE firms into an A-share listing, regulators now need to amend securities and corporate laws and revise domestic listing rules, as direct investment in China's A-share market is off-limits to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange says it has already started putting together a blueprint to attract IPOs by foreign companies, particularly “red chips”, or mainland companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, but with controlling Chinese shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Shanghai exchange officials said its fresh initiative to attract technology-leading IPOs has the solid backing of the Chinese leadership, further north in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of their agenda is clearly creating the next generation of tech behemoths on a par with established leaders such as Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, with the full backing of the domestic capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the Shanghai exchange beating its Hong Kong counterpart in terms of value for IPOs for the first time last year, the signs are strong that more investors could well take the bait.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should only allow exceptionally big technology firms with multiple class share structure to list in the city to prevent poor quality ones from abusing the system, say bankers and lawmakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing rule reform is exciting as it would allow more technology companies to consider the prospect of a Hong Kong listing and allow investors to be able to participate in these new economy companies,” Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive of China Renaissance, a Chinese investment bank that has helped many start-ups and biotech firms to list, told the South China Morning Post in an interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it is very important for HKEX [Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing] to keep the bar high to maintain high standards while accepting a broader range of listing candidates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is in the midst of its largest listing reform in decades aimed at lifting the exchange's attractiveness to compete for more technology firms to list here instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June large biotech firms without revenue and giant technology firms with dual class shareholding structure would be allowed to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class share companies allow one class of shareholders to have more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders. These are favoured by many tech firm founders as many of them hold minority stakes but want to have control. Meanwhile, biotech firms usually have no revenue in the research period. The current Hong Kong listing rules do not allow them to list here but they can list in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at the US, there are in fact not many technology companies listed in the dual class share structure, but only the very large and successful ones such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abused.”The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abusedFan Bao, chairman and CEO of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX next month will issue a detailed consultation on the listing reform, but Bao wants to see more investor protection measures in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The view is echoed by fund mangers and lawmakers, with many calling for a “sunset clause” - a provision that requires these dual class share companies, after certain years of listing, to seek shareholders' approval to continue with the structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Struggling Chinese tech start-ups given US$800m lifeline from new China Renaissance fund[http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/1844762/struggling-chinese-tech-start-ups-given-us800m-lifeline-new-china]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing, however, told lawmakers during the financial affairs panel meeting last week that the exchange would not go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we were to introduce such a sunset clause, some tech companies might consider Hong Kong to be too restrictive and they may not come here to list,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenneth Leung, lawmaker for accountancy, said the exchange could consider setting a longer period such as 20 years for the sunset clause.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of letting the founders have special voting rights is to allow them to have control for a longer time to implement their vision. If they are doing well for 20 years, the investors would support and approve them to continue to have special voting rights. If they do not do a good job, investors should also have the right to say no,” Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A proposal by Hong Kong and mainland China's stock exchanges to let investors partake in initial public offerings in each other's markets has been given an added impetus by the prospect of attracting the US$2 trillion </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is one of several global equity bourses including New York, London, Tokyo, Toronto and Singapore contending to be the staging ground for Aramco's IPO, estimated to be US$100 billion in size. The proposal, known as the “Primary Equity Connect,” would let investors from China's US$7.6 trillion capital market gain access to the Aramco IPO through Hong Kong, increasing the city's attractiveness as a place for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From China's side, Aramco listing in Hong Kong can also provide a “natural hedge” for domestic investors against the oil price volatility, said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the exchange operator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The “primary equity connect” and the Aramco listing in Hong Kong can be a successful combination, as both sides are able to benefit from it, Li said during a conference in the city. “It's a win-win situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li didn't specify on the timetable of the launch of primary equity connect, but said the exchange has been in talks with relevant parties. “We never stop (the talks),” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Li said in his blog that the “Primary Equity Connect” is feasible from a technical perspective, but important work remains for regulators to iron out the right regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The connect plan is the latest piece of a process of fostering closer integration between Hong Kong's equity market with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has launched three of the so-called connect schemes since 2014 with Chinese markets to facilitate cross-border trading. These comprised the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016, and the Bond Connect in July.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco, owned and run by the government of Saudi Arabia, plans to sell up to 5 per cent of the oil company in a 2018 IPO in one or more international markets beyond the stock exchange in Riyadh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even listing only 5 per cent of the US$2 trillion company would lead to a US$100 billion IPO, the biggest ever in world history, and leagues ahead of Alibaba's record US$25 billion flotation in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, Li also said the HKEX has finished the consultation on a new trading board and the conclusion could “hopefully” come out in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX started a public consultation in June for establishing a so-called “third board”, after the current board and Growth Enterprise Market, aiming to lure more new economy listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board could allow companies ranging from internet start-ups to biotech firms with dual-class share structures to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX has received positive feedbacks about establishing the “third board”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange might launch a second round of consultation on details about listing rules, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to find new ways to lure new economy companies to stay competitive,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX proposed in 2015 to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February, Singapore's stock exchange started a public consultation on introducing a dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted to list in New York as its corporate governance structure was refused in Hong Kong. It triggered a hot debate in Hong Kong on dual-class shares and how to balance the interests of founding shareholders and executives with investors'.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has failed to secure a spot in the top 10 league table for funds raised from IPOs of technology companies worldwide, which surged three times to US$18.87 billion in the first eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong's main board only ranked at the world's 12th largest market in terms of IPO funds raised by technology companies, while the second board Growth Enterprise Market ranked 19th.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This marks a contrast to the ranking for the world's largest IPO market, where Hong Kong's main board is placed fourth as its strength lies in drawing financial firms to list, but not technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Hong Kong has seen improvement this year. So far, three technology firm IPOs have raised a combined US$424.1 million this year, which is 30 times higher than the same period last year when one firm raised US$14.8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increase is largely attributed to the IPO of FIT Hon Teng, a subsidiary of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and maker of connectors for Apple's iPhones that raised US$393.58 million in June. It was also the world's eighth largest technology firm IPO this year.</span></p>

The volume is substantially lower than the New York Stock Exchange, the top technology IPO centre, where four technology firm IPOs to date have raised US$4.56 billion, accounting for 24.2 per cent of global funds raised, the Thomson Reuters data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Swiss Stock Exchange ranked second and South Korean ranked third, while Shenzhen ChiNext ranked fourth, and Singapore was fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other markets,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the city's financial services sector.Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other marketsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has been a worldwide trend that there are more and more new economy and technology companies seeking for listings. They are the future driving force of the worldwide economy. If our market could not capture these companies to list, we would lag behind,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has just completed a consultation to set up a third board to attract more technology companies to list, but it would still need a second round of consultation for the detailed rules. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wants the new board to be launched in the first half of 2018, but he will have to convince all stakeholders to accept the proposals that have received very mixed reactions during the two-month consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have different regulations from the existing main board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has proposed the third board to have two markets: a premium market for companies eligible to list on the main board but with dual-class shareholding structures and open to all investors, and a second market for start-ups and open only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong currently bans dual class shares which are allowed in the US. Dual class shareholding allows founders or key management of the companies to own shares with more voting rights than the others, which large technology firms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> preferred.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the largest technology IPO this year which raised US$3.9 billion on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in March, also has a dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, Francis Leung Pak-to on Monday showed support for a new market for dual class share companies with a market cap of HK$8 billion (US$1 billion) to list, but opposed to a start-up board market as he said the risks of failures of these newly set up companies were too high.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A contentious proposal to allow dual share listings on Hong Kong's bourse emerged top of the agenda at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by the chief executive, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forum, championed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] and chaired by the finance chief, held its first meeting on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po[http://www.scmp.com/topics/paul-chan] confirmed the attendees had discussed whether to allow dual-class share companies to list in the city after receiving separate briefings from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We had a very good discussion with some very good opinions raised,” Chan told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He revealed the two market bodies would do “follow-up work” on what had been discussed and that the forum would meet again next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A government statement quoted Chan as saying at the closed-door meeting: “The Government attaches great importance to enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. While we endeavour to uphold market quality, we should also actively seek to further develop and broaden our capital markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the meeting, HKEX, operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, set out its proposal for the establishment of a third board to give companies with dual-share structures a way to list as well as those with no track record of profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The public consultation ended earlier this month, with financial industry professionals still divided over the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia, who is not a member of the forum, presented on Wednesday.Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit?Dr David Wong Yau-kar, MPF Schemes Authority</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's support reflects a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it deemed the proposal at the time lacking sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As recently as last month, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder, also a forum member, said there was a need to reposition Hong Kong's listed market amid the shrinking size of initial public offerings in the past decade and trading volume in newly listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there was a need to strike a balance between “a healthier supply of interesting companies” at the top end of the stock market and greater demand by investors for more diverse companies at the lower end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source at the meeting revealed that the consultation showed consensus on broadening markets and allowing dual-class shares but opinion was split on how to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carrie Lam, who met the forum members before they had their pow-wow, was quoted in the government press release as saying that the financial services sector, as a pillar industry contributing 18 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, should seize opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area proposal to “better serve our real economy”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many major technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> offer dual-class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. Unlike the US, Hong Kong bars such shares, favouring the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forum member Dr David Wong Yau-kar, chairman of the Mandatory Provident Fund[http://www.scmp.com/topics/mpf] Schemes Authority, noted the attendees on Wednesday had raised their views on the proposed third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most people agree Hong Kong should attract new-economy companies to list here, but the question is how to do it. Do we need a new board?” he asked. “Do we accept dual-class share companies? Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit? There are many different ways to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong added he could not detail individual views or the government's stance, citing confidentiality.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other forum members include Hong Kong Monetary Authority[http://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-monetary-authority] Chief Executive Norman Chan Tak-lam, Securities and Futures Commission CEO Ashley Alder, and Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Executive councillors Bernard Chan, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, Chow Chung-kong and Joseph Yam Chi-kwong are also members, as are Carlson Tong Ka-shing and Moses Cheng Mo-chi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 30 government reports on financial matters were distributed to the 10 forum members to keep track of proposals and their implementation and they agreed to meet again in the next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong described the forum as not a decision-making body but a high-ranking consultation group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Carrie Lam is very concerned about the group, as she initiated it in her manifesto,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chief executive announced the forum during her election campaign earlier this year, saying the government should play a more active and leading role in policymaking and matters of monetary stability, financial safety and regulation. The idea was to reinforce Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam believed the forum could offer a platform to discuss strategic and forward-looking proposals and keep track of the implementation of such proposals by government departments and other relevant parties.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States will not be an easy option for the potential US$15 billion listing of Alibaba, which has been stuck in a war of words with the Hong Kong stock exchange and regulator over its listing plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government and financial industry sources familiar with the situation told the South China Morning Post that the e-commerce giant would face similar problems regarding its shareholding structure as it did with Hong Kong authorities if it decided to list on the New York Stock Exchange or its smaller rival Nasdaq.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike the stock markets in the US, Hong Kong's listing policy does not allow companies to issue two classes of shares. What Alibaba has been seeking goes even beyond dual class - an arrangement that would help founder Jack Ma Yun and his management team retain control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the partnership structure that Alibaba has been pushing for, the average shareholder would be even more disadvantaged than the dual-class listing model the US permits, and this is why it would encounter the same resistance there as well, lawyers say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the system allowed in the US, equity shareholders have the power to nominate or dispose of directors. Under Alibaba's preferred structure, they would not enjoy these rights, leaving them with no effective monitoring role, said lawyers specialising in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class voting structure is common in the US markets as many technology firms, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, adopted it to go public. It allowed the senior management, including the founders, of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> to retain control of the companies even as they tapped the market for funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, if Alibaba wants to restructure the company's current partnership model into a dual-class voting model, it will take a long time to go through the internal processes and garner the approval of its existing shareholders. Besides, the partnership Ma prefers is not common for a company of Alibaba's size seeking a listing in the US, say lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong regulators want absolute transparency in disclosure as well as suitability for listing, which includes corporate governance, while the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> [of the US] is not a prudential regulator and focuses on whether a company's disclosure includes all information that investors would regard as material to their investment decision, including whether the company meets the corporate governance standards of the relevant stock exchange," said Steven Winegar, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong stock exchange operator have made it clear to Alibaba that there is no room for exemption for any company as listing rules do not allow preferential treatment of one set of shareholders over another. Alibaba may find itself similarly hamstrung in persuading the US regulators, given its history of a public spat with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> over a secret transfer of Alipay's ownership to Jack Ma's private company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has more than 20 partners, including Ma, his co-founders and other senior executives. Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, which together own more than 60 per cent, are not included in the partnership structure that was established internally in 2009. </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> have both said they support Alibaba's partnership structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma's problems with a US listing for Alibaba goes beyond the partnership structure. The bigger concern would be rebuilding his credibility on Wall Street after a 2011 dispute with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, one of Alibaba's early investors and major shareholders, on secretly transferring one of the most valuable assets of the group to a third party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma shocked Wall Street in May 2011 when investors realised he had transferred Alipay, a leading online payment system created and owned by Alibaba, to a private company held by Ma outside the group. </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> was outraged and some US fund managers even threatened to sue Ma in the US. </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba later resolved their differences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The case, which came to be commonly known as the "VIE problem" on Wall Street - referring to an investment vehicle called a "variable interest entity" that allows mainland firms to access capital from foreign investors through offshore platforms rather than through their mainland entities to avoid China's tight and complicated foreign exchange controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incident triggered a round of sell-offs in US-listed mainland firms, including Sina.com China's No2 web portal, as US investors became suspicious of mainland companies imitating the Alibaba case.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is still permissible for Chinese companies to list with VIEs in their corporate structure, but investors are mindful of </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">'s months-long battle over the ownership of Alipay," Winegar said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a Xinhua piece in 2009, Ma said: "Let all Wall Street investors scold us. We insist that clients are No1, employees are No2 and shareholders should be No3."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked about Ma's 2009 comments, an Alibaba spokesman told the Post: "Shareholders are important and we respect them, but they come at No3 because they are the beneficiaries of doing No1 and No2 right."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to elaborate on its persistance in a partnership structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission has unveiled key conditions for companies seeking to list in the city with dual-share structures, marking a major step forward in reform of the listing rules designed to help Hong Kong compete with the US in attracting listings by technology firms and other innovative enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conditions have high thresholds as the regulator does not plan to open the door too wide and allow too many companies to apply for such a shareholding structure, because the city does not allow class-action lawsuits to protect shareholders??interests, unlike the United States.The SFC still supports one share, one voteCarlson Tong, SFC chairman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC only wants to allow certain types of newly listed, innovative companies to be eligible for dual-share structures, and only as long as they meet conditions the SFC considers important for shareholder protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said companies applying for dual-share structures would have to be restricted to firms whose founders held only small stakes but whose contributions or innovations were vital to the business, such as in technology firms. Companies with majority shareholders should not be allowed to have such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other conditions designed to ensure investor protection should include sunset provisions, so that the special shareholding structure would end in a certain number of years or when the founders sold their stakes or left the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would support the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) carrying out a second phase of detailed consultation on dual-share structure reform if the exchange could address those issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC still supports one share, one vote,??Tong said. We do not plan to allow all companies to do it. However, we are not turning a deaf ear to market demand to enhance our market to compete with the US for new listings.??/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the first time the SFC had made its position clear on controversial listing reform proposals. HKEx is pushing for reforms to enable Hong Kong to maintain its position as a listing hub for mainland firms after the city lost some heavyweight technology firm listings to the US in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is the city's ultimate market regulator and the HKEx reform proposal would need its approval. Its position appears to clear a major obstacle for the reform, with some market watchers saying it could be introduced in six months to a year. That could help attract many technology firms such as mobile phone maker Xiaomi to list in Hong Kong instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx consulted the market last year on whether it should change listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure which it banned in 1989, after refusing to give Alibaba an exemption from the ban. The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only held a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong. The SFC still believes no exemption should be given but supports rules with clear conditions for companies seeking to apply for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba took its listing to New York, where dual-class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them were information technology companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structures allow one class of shareholder to have more rights than others. Many technology firms??founders sell stakes early on as they seek funding, resulting in them holding small stakes. They argue that dual-share structures protect their interests but many fund managers believe such structures are unfair because they would damage investor protection for small shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York took the lead in IPO funds raised, with US$29 billion in 2017, up 139.2 per cent from 2016.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figures show that Hong Kong is failing to attract new technology companies.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A high-powered financial forum initiated by new Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and chaired by Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has discussed reforms to attract more new-economy companies to list on our stock market. It is a clear signal of the key part the direction of economic development is expected to play in Lam's first policy address next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new economy has already galvanised the traditional business rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore, which are both now playing catch-up to avoid being left behind. The island state may become the first Asian bourse to allow dual-class-share initial public offers - a reform also at the top of the agenda of the Hong Kong forum - in a bid to become a tech hub and a regional magnet for IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has also so far not allowed such listings, which enable founding shareholders to retain control with minority holdings by giving some shares more weight, because of worries about sidelining ordinary shareholders. But they have been on the city's mind ever since e-commerce giant Alibaba - owner of the Post - took its dual-class-share listing to New York after it was rejected by Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time for Hong Kong to define the ‘new economy' amid talk of third board at stock exchange[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2105149/time-hong-kong-define-new-economy-amid-talk-third-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent public consultation on the controversial idea is reported to have revealed consensus among finance industry professionals on broadening the market and allowing dual-class shares on a third trading board that would also host start-ups with no profit record, but division on how to go about it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> both presented briefings and will do follow-up work before the forum reconvenes in the last quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, but we face regional competitors who are prepared to undertake aggressive structural reforms in a bid to capture the opportunities offered by China's rise. If Hong Kong does not push forward and clings to old ways of doing business, it stands to miss out. In that respect it is good that in Lam's consultations ahead of her policy address, a recurring theme of her remarks has been the need to strike a balance between regulation to protect investors and development, in order to meet the needs of the new economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the development of the new economy, share structures can be quite different from traditional companies. As a result regulations are prone to become outdated. It is good to see the government set up this forum headed by the financial secretary to look into the issue. We trust economic policy will be a centrepiece of the policy address, and that the government will set some landmark direction on where Hong Kong is headed over the next five years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is garnering support towards creating a third board to attract technology start-ups and new economy firms. But safeguards on corporate governance, investor education and transparency in the downside risks are needed to ensure the success of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) has just completed a consultation over the proposed third board, but a second round of consultation on the detailed rules is still needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new third board will offer two markets, one for listing big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, which would open to all investors. The second board is for start-ups which would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main and GEM boards have adopted the one-share one-vote principle in the belief that a dual-class share structure can lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders. Venture capitalists and fund managers also tend to oppose to weighted voting rights as they reduce the price at which they can sell their shares relative to international peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But attitudes of Hong Kong regulators and some market participants are starting to shift, with focus turning to the development of the city's future competitiveness and the appropriate measures to safeguard investors' interests and mitigate governance risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX's proposals strive to address the market quality and risk profile concerns," said Nelson Tang, a partner in the corporate department of </span><span class="s3">Hogan Lovells</span><span class="s1">. "Clearer guidance however from the regulators is needed and a ‘one size fits all' approach should be avoided."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the suggested accelerated delisting regime may allow for quicker enforcement by the stock regulator, which is key to enhancing profitability and corporate governance if listed companies want to maintain their listed status while removing poor performers from the board, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board PRO will restrict access to professional investors only in trading start-ups lacking a financial track record. While this may address concerns that retail investors are perceived to be more vulnerable and less sophisticated, some may argue that a complete ban is an unfair deprivation of an opportunity to invest in these high growth companies. A more flexible approach could be explored by allowing retail investors to participate with additional safeguards in place, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators are also looking at the "primary equity connect" concept, an extended model of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes as an avenue to help with the liquidity of the new and current boards, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marketing and investor education will help make investors savvier when investing in the tech industry, and therefore enhance the appeal for those companies to list in Hong Kong, improving stock liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's proposed third board consultation comes amid the government's promotion on Hong Kong's role in the Lok Ma Chau loop project with Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area integration, which appears to be an effort in developing an innovative culture for education and investment of new economy companies in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Luke Waddington, chief executive of Hong Kong-based fintech Bluepool, says Hong Kong requires a more coherent regulatory framework and bigger government grants to create an innovation technology ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These companies [in Singapore] are on the path towards growing into a large company quickly that eventually aim to IPO. But I don't get the sense that is what has been happening in Hong Kong," Waddington said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He praised Singapore's model as making things much easier for start-ups, citing the ease with which funding can be raised, as well as the ability to exit an investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington added that Singapore has a more coherent regulatory framework designed to get different organisations to come together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore said earlier this year it was seeking public feedback on a suitable regulatory framework to allow the listing of dual-class structures. HKEX invited the public to submit their feedback on the proposed board under a deadline that ended earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore has also announced that it is replicating the UK model, linking the stock regulator with the central bank and businesses so that they can create funding and sandbox mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong has allocated resources to business incubators in Science Park and Cyberport overseen by bureaucrats with little entrepreneurial experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington said a better approach would be to give cash grants directly to entrepreneurs as small companies often struggle to cover the fees to meet licensing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the overall ecosystem can support innovative and new economy companies, then investors will understand why we need a third board and dual-share voting structure," Edward Au, co-leader National Public Offering Group at Deloitte said. "This spirit seems to be starting to develop in Hong Kong now."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has been the world's second largest initial public offering (IPO) market by value over the past two decades, driven mainly by the listing here of a swathe of mainland companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is one sector in particular that the market has largely failed to attract strong applicant interest from, technology and new economy companies, which continues to be dominated by New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong was the world's largest IPO market by value last year, raising US$24.53 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 1997, the city languished in eighth place, when new listings were worth just US$5.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past two decades it has topped the global IPO list in 2015, and from 2009 to 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a running total, over those 20 years, some US$388 billion has been raised in Hong Kong up to the first quarter of 2017, ranking it second over that timescale to New York, which remains well ahead at US$675.8 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/7c3dfdcc-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arguably the missed listing that hurt officials in Hong Kong the most was that of mainland China e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which chose the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> to host the world's largest IPO to date, for US$25 billion in 2014. Alibaba now owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But on the flipside, Hong Kong has also scored notable victories over its Manhattan rival, hosting the world's second and third biggest floats: </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1"> of China's US$22.1 billion listing in 2010 and </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$21.96 billion offering in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Prior to 1997, the Hong Kong stock market was dominated by traditional Hong Kong-based companies, such as British conglomerates or local companies in the utilities, finance, real estate or trading sectors," said Johnson Chui, the managing director and head of Asia-Pacific equity capital markets at Credit Suisse.Prior to 1997, the Hong Kong stock market was dominated by traditional Hong Kong-based companies, such as British conglomerates or local companies in the utilities, finance, real estate or trading sectorsJohnson Chui, managing director and head of Asia-Pacific equity capital markets, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Today, it is an international hub, playing an important role of being the gateway to China."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese companies have dominated Hong Kong's IPO market, last year raising HK$156.6 billion in the city, representing 82 per cent of all listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of 2016, 1,002 mainland Chinese firms were listed in Hong Kong, representing half the bourse's total 2,009 companies. They represented 63 per cent of the total market capitalisation and 69 per cent of turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong will continue to play a leading role as an important gateway for Chinese companies to access international markets - but Hong Kong will need to adapt to the rapid changes taking place in the markets," Chui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, on June 16 issued a public consultation on the proposal to launch a New Board, or the so-called Third Board - on top of the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (for growth companies that do not fulfil the requirements of profitability or track record) - with more flexible rules to attract tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/83dad30c-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Board will have two markets - one for mega companies that match all the main board requirements but who cannot list here because they have dual-class stock structures, while the other will be for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class structure refers to when a company issues various types of shares with different voting rights - favoured by many technology firms as their founders usually hold minority stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bans companies with such a structure while the US allows them to list, which is one reason why Hong Kong has previously lost out to some technology offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation process for the New Board will last for two months. If it gains enough support, the HKEX will issue a second consultation on detailed rules of the New Board which may then be launched sometime next year.Hong Kong's well-oiled IPO process and stable regulatory regimes are also key reasons why investors and Chinese companies favour the Hong Kong marketChristopher Laskowski, managing director and head of corporate and investment banking, Citi Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial firms still dominate the Hong Kong market with 69 per cent of the funds raised last year, while tech firms accounted for a mere 3 per cent, according to consulting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui, the managing director of Hantec Pacific, has no doubt Hong Kong's role as a platform for raising funds for mainland companies will continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we have a biased profile for our IPO market. We focus very much on attracting Chinese companies - particularly mainland banks and brokers. We haven't done well in attracting international firms to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, the chief executive at Capital Link International, said the ability of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares companies and attract technology firms are the key issues for Hong Kong's IPO market in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The exchange needs to be innovative and prove it can adapt and evolve as fast and efficiently as the companies they wish to attract to list. There is no upside to cutting-edge technology companies listing on outdated exchanges that have not recognised the times are changing," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/8826e5e0-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Laskowski, the managing director and head of corporate and investment banking at Citi Hong Kong, says Chinese companies like to list in Hong Kong as they can gain access to international markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their numbers are increasing all the time via the two Stock Connect cross-border share-trading schemes, which allow mainlanders to buy stocks in listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through the schemes, the so-called Southbound investment represented 9 per cent of all Hong Kong turnover in the first quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong's well-oiled IPO process and stable regulatory regimes are also key reasons why investors and Chinese companies favour the Hong Kong market," Laskowski said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Depending as strongly as the Hong Kong market does on mainland business, and being linked so inextricably with it, the city will naturally be affected by any slowdown of the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A number of corporate governance issues have arisen involving China companies although we believe they remain company specific, rather than market wide," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But as projects eventually become reality within the Chinese government's flagship "Belt and Road Initiative", which is dominated by the building and financing of infrastructure projects in some 65 countries, Laskowski is hopeful too that many of the companies involved will be looking to Hong Kong for their funding choices, ensuring its strong IPO traffic levels will continue unabated, and become even more diversified.</span></p>

As the IPO market is the lifeblood of the Hong Kong stock exchange, it's understandable its bosses want listing rules to be as competitive as those of premier investment hubs like New York and London to attract newcomers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stumbling block has been the long-standing "one share, one vote" rule, from which Alibaba had wanted to be exempted to retain control of its board membership. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> made the right decision not to bend the rule for Alibaba. But it does not mean the rule itself should not be reviewed and changed in future. This is why the exchange is now seeking public views on whether to allow potential listing companies to have special shareholding structures that would have allowed Alibaba to list in Hong Kong rather than New York. The exchange says it is keeping an open mind and does not have a fixed position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation followed proposals made by the Financial Services Development Council, which included changing the rule for the main board or creating new boards for companies, especially hi-tech ones that tend to favour so-called dual-class share structures to retain management control. On the surface, "one share, one vote" seems fair and sensible. In reality, it does not really affect ordinary retail investors, who rarely accumulate a big enough stake in a company to make a difference. Such fights are usually between significant minority shareholders like fund managers and company management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The jury is still out on whether a dual-class structure is good or bad for shareholder returns. </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, Warren Buffett's </span><span class="s3">Berkshire Hathaway</span><span class="s1"> and London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> all have similar such share structures, and their returns speak for themselves. On the other hand, a joint </span><span class="s3">Wharton School</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Harvard Business School</span><span class="s1"> study found that while large ownership stakes in managers' hands tend to strengthen corporate performance, heavy voting control by insiders weakens it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It appears management quality is the key. If investors are buying into such companies, they are placing their trust in their managers for superior returns. Otherwise, they should avoid investing in them. But there is no reason why Hong Kong investors should not have this choice.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji recruited then Hong Kong securities regulator Laura Cha Shih May-lung to help bring order to the mainland's unruly emerging stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seventeen years later, she is now responsible for overseeing implementation of reforms to ensure the local bourse is the No 1 destination for mainland company listings, ahead of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore and New York. Cha, 68, nominated enhancement of the city's competitiveness as her greatest challenge after the board of directors of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> elected her as its chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This reflected the greatest regret of retiring chairman Chow Chung-kong - the failure of the bourse to land the US$25 billion initial public offering of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, now owner of the South China Morning Post, in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba listed in New York because its dual-class share structure was not then accepted in Hong Kong under the principle of one share, one vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This prompted debate culminating in the introduction this week of the biggest listing reforms in 25 years, including the acceptance of applications from companies with dual-class shares, and from biotechnology firms that have no record of generating revenue and therefore would not meet the financial eligibility tests of the main board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a perfect world, the one-share, one-vote principle served Hong Kong well as the exchange developed sound regulatory practices and built a reputation for investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the real world of the new economy, innovation and risk-taking, however, dual-class shares are more attractive to company founders and key executives who want to retain control with minority shareholdings as a company grows and attracts more investor capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, a career financial regulator and an executive councillor, left the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> to join the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> as vice-chairman between 2001 to 2004.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland stock markets were plagued by insider trading and illicit deals. Cha struggled against vested interests to establish sound regulatory practices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She returned home to serve on the board of HKEX before becoming chairman of the Financial Services Development Council for the past few years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While looking forward to a liberalised listing regime, let us not forget the penny stocks and their ilk - including the notorious Enigma Network - that have thrived in the city's laissez-faire regulatory environment to filch many illiterate minority investors of their life savings.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun[http://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] on Monday promised to consider listing the company in Hong Kong and increasing investment in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma was responding to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam]'s invitation at the inauguration ceremony of the Hong Kong Association of Zhejiang Entrepreneurs on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The executive chairman of the e-commerce giant, who is also the chairman of the General Association of Zhejiang Entrepreneurs, engaged in a fireside discussion with Lam during the ceremony, where Ma praised Lam for possessing great leadership for offering the invitation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A mere politician will never dare to say so,” Ma said. “Alibaba will take this message. We will definitely consider Hong Kong's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope we can further invest in Hong Kong and enhance our participation in the city's economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam's invitation came after the passing of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposal to allow companies offering different classes of shares with different voting power to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now I hope Alibaba can come back to list in Hong Kong,” Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the stock exchange had decided to start allowing the dual-class share system in midyear, and described allowing the system as a form of economic innovation.I have never been as confident in Hong Kong as todayJack Ma</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the move would encourage more companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The passing of the system follows local authorities' rejection of a plan by Alibaba in 2014 to adopt a structure that would allow Ma to appoint more than half of the company's board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures, while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the ceremony, Ma said he first met Lam in the chief executive's office and talked with her for about 20 minutes, during which time they discussed the rejection, as well as how to encourage young start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I believe the passing of the dual-class share system will bring great changes and will help Hong Kong greatly in its future reforms,” he said. “I have never been as confident in Hong Kong as today.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma said there were many young talented people in Hong Kong and he urged them to find more opportunities on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said she believed the city could nurture entrepreneurs like Ma and invited Ma to share his innovation experiences with local young people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and Lam have met each other more than once before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Ma met Lam at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province. During the meeting, Ma offered to play a bigger role in helping Hong Kong develop a “more fashionable”, cashless society, by taking advantage of Alibaba's growing data clouding and e-payment systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November in Hong Kong, at the grand finale of Alibaba's start-up competition, Jumpstarter 2017, the pair chatted about how Hong Kong could attract technology talents from the outside and how local talent can take advantage of opportunities elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In her first policy address in October, Lam said she would lead a new high-level interdepartmental steering committee on innovation and technology, and emphasised the importance of Hong Kong becoming a “smart city” to maintain its global competitiveness.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange reclaimed its crown as the No 1 IPO market in the world in 2018, beating last year's winner New York, as listing reforms led to the highest fundraising in eight years, according to Refinitiv data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main board had a 17.6 per cent share of the global IPO market this year as of December 21, with 125 companies raising US$36.5 billion. This was the highest since 2010 and up 175.5 per cent from last year, according to the data provider formerly known as </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on the other hand saw 64 IPOs raising US$28.9 billion, accounting for 13.9 per cent of the global IPO market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong was the No 1 IPO market in 2015 and 2016, the city mainly attracted traditional manufacturing firms and financial companies, with few tech companies listing here as they preferred New York and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In terms of TMT (telecommunications, media and technology) listings, Hong Kong came second after Tokyo in its highest ranking ever in this category.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest reforms in 25 years allowing dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list proved to be a major driving force in boosting tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class or weighted voting rights shareholding companies allow founders and key management greater say than other shareholders. These are favoured by many technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> and others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms launched by the bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April attracted two dual-class shareholding companies: the world's fourth largest smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in its July listing, and food delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> with its US$4.9 billion IPO in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobile tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion IPO - the largest IPO in Hong Kong this year - was also tech related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overall TMT IPOs raised US$15.7 billion, up 605.5 per cent from 2017 while the number grew 94.4 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tokyo's rise to third place in the IPO league table this year was also due to its ability to draw tech plays with US$24.5 billion in proceeds. This was mainly due to Softbank mobile unit's US$23.3 billion jumbo IPO this month - Japan's largest ever IPO and the world's second largest after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion fundraising in New York in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Japanese conglomerate owns stakes in e-commerce giant Alibaba and ride-sharing companies Uber and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, among others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Telecommunications and hi-tech were the two biggest fundraising sectors in Hong Kong this year, representing 39 per cent of funds raised, compared to 10 per cent in 2017. The financial sector, traditionally the largest sector in Hong Kong, this year represented just 9.5 per cent of all fundraising, compared to 32 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised from Hong Kong's equity capital markets - share placements, rights issues and IPOs - stood at US$64.2 billion in 2018, up 80 per cent year on year. It was also the highest after US$91.7 billion raised in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The listing reform has attracted many big players to list in Hong Kong but it was at the expense of lowering our corporate governance standards,” said Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner of </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1">. "The HKEX will need to introduce more measures to enhance investor protection.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said Hong Kong's IPO market will face pressure from Shanghai when it launches its new tech board in 2019, as China's financial capital will be competing for the same group of unicorns as Hong Kong and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accounting and consulting firm </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> said that it expects IPOs to decline by HK$100 billion (US$12.7 billion) next year amid market uncertainties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at global law firm Dechert, said that unless issues surrounding the global markets - the US-China trade war, Brexit and political unrest in certain parts of Europe - are resolved, Hong Kong will see a noticeable slowdown in IPO activity next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, the first unprofitable early-stage biotechnology company to list in Hong Kong under revised rules, rose on debut on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the Chinese maker of HIV, cancer and liver disease drugs, gained as much as 6.4 per cent from the initial public offering price to HK$14.90 in morning trading. The Hangzhou-drug maker posted a net loss of 86.9 million yuan (US$12.8 million) last year, according to its prospectus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Given it is the first biotech stock under the new listing regime to debut, some retail investors would find it an attractive speculative bet,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director of VC Asset Management, noting the stock had traded as high as HK$15.6 in the grey market earlier. “This is despite the recent product quality scandals in the pharmaceutical sector … stock investors tend to have short memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the listing reform has attracted biotechnology and other technology firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Biotechnology firms and other innovative industry have a lot of room of development,” Li said after attending the listing ceremony of Ascletis on Wednesday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX would continue to work with the mainland regulator to allow the dual class shareholding companies to be able to be traded by the mainlanders via the stock connects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1"> is the latest company to draw the attention of investors after the low profile debut of smartphone maker Xiaomi, after the city's stock exchange loosened the listing rules to entice more hi-tech companies by allowing unprofitable companies and those with dual-class structures to float shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi dropped 1.2 per cent on its first day of trading on July 9 before traders boosted buying of the stock on bets that the shares were undervalued. The stock was trading at HK$17.58 on Wednesday morning, 4.6 per cent above its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong, which is struggling to defend its title as a financial hub in Asia, is facing increasing competition from the Chinese mainland and even Singapore in wooing the listings of companies with the fastest earnings growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China's securities regulator has introduced Chinese depositary receipts to attract companies like </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has also started to accept companies with dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/01/6364db8c-953c-11e8-acb0-2eccab85240c_image_hires_115622.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a wider listing rules revamp that took effect on April 30, biotechnology firms without profit or even revenue are allowed to apply for a listing on Hong Kong's stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, seven biotech firms have so far submitted applications to list under the new rules, including Nasdaq-listed Chinese cancer treatments developer </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, which is the first to apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> currently has 38 listed biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The level of interest - eight having submitted formal application - has been higher than my expectation,” said Charles Chau Chi-chung, a partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Jones Day</span><span class="s1">, who is helping biotech clients prepare listings in Hong Kong. “Earlier I expected five to be listed by the end of this year, now I would not be surprised if eight to 10 will make their market debut by then. So far, the listing candidates that have submitted applications tend to be relatively more established companies within the sector ... they are also careful in their choice of sponsors to ensure success.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The international tranche - accounting for 90 per cent - of Ascletis' HK$2.98 billion shares offer was only 1.17 times subscribed, while its Hong Kong public offer - 10 per cent of the total - was eight times oversubscribed. It priced its shares at HK$14, the middle of an indicative range of HK$12 to HK$16.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures that list on the Hong Kong bourse under its new listing rules will join the Hang Seng Composite Index so that they can be traded by mainland Chinese and international investors through the Stock Connect schemes, the index compiler, Hang Seng Indexes Company, said on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first such company is likely to be Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which filed for a listing in Hong Kong last week that could be the world's biggest flotation since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion debut in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such companies would not join the benchmark Hang Seng Index for now, the compiler said, meaning passive fund investors that track the Hang Seng Index would not be able to trade in them as they only buy companies in the benchmark index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision, which comes just after the bourse operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), unveiled reforms to allow companies with dual-shareholding structures to list on the exchange for the first time, will be subject to a review at an unspecified time in the future, according to the index compiler.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform aims to attract more technology firms to list, but we also need to achieve a balance of market concerns … there are fund mangers who have expressed concern that they would be forced to buy into these stocks if they are included in the benchmark,” said Vincent Kwan, director and general manager of Hang Seng Indexes Company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We would need to wait for more companies with dual shareholding structures to list here and monitor their trading patterns before we can decide on what conditions we should impose for them to be qualify to be included in Hang Seng Index,” Kwan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huge number of Chinese tech unicorns likely to IPO in Hong Kong in 2018, says JPMorgan Asia-Pacific chief[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144880/huge-number-chinese-tech-unicorns-likely-ipo-hong-kong-2018-says]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting rights over other shareholders.Such structures are popular among tech firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, but the Hong Kong bourse's previous refusal to allow such structures had seen it lose out as a choice of IPO destination.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some local fund managers have expressed concern that companies with such structures do not follow the one-share one-vote principle that previously defined Hong Kong's listing rules. This has led some of them, particularly passive fund managers that track the major indices, to urge the index compiler not to add these firms into the Hang Seng Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index covers the top 50 largest blue chips, while Hang Seng Composite Index has 483 constituent stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is good to see dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index so as to allow mainland Chinese to invest via the Stock Connect schemes,” saidChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers. The Stock Connect schemes link the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, allowing both onshore and offshore investors to trade in all three markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he urged the index compiler to consider quickly including such firms in the Hang Seng Index, as they are taking important roles in the local economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Excluding them would mean less fund managers would invest in them and hence the liquidity of stock trading would be affected, as would the competitiveness of Hong Kong in trying to attract these companies to list here,” Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another pillar of the listing reform was to allow biotechnology firms that have yet to generate any revenue to list in Hong Kong, an effort to capture part of a growing industry. However the compiler will not consider including such firms in any major index for now, Kwan said, after some investors raised concerns over risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These biotech companies are new to Hong Kong investors. We need time to study their trading patterns before including them in major indices,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One week after the launch of the new listing rules, only Xiaomi has submitted an application, in contrast to market expectations of about a dozen firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to support the new economy and tech companies after missing out on opportunities such as the listing of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and the development of leading Chinese drone maker DJI, chief executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Tuesday in an interview at the RISE conference in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We learned the lesson when we lost the Hong Kong listing of Alibaba in 2014 to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, as back then our listing rules didn't allow dual class shareholdings,” said Lam, referring to the market debut of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, which this week became the first dual-class stock listed on the Hong Kong bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government's new listing rules, which took effect in April, accept formal applications under a system that permits dual-class shares - a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders. “We are making listing rules more in step with the new economy … because the world is changing and to stay competitive and on top, we need to continuously revisit our rules and regulations to adapt to the new changes,” said Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the city hopes to bring tech companies to Hong Kong's capital markets, Lam also stressed the government's efforts to retain talent and nurture its own tech start-ups, after the city missed out on the opportunity to nurture further growth of the world's largest maker of recreational drones, DJI, whose founder Wang Tao, an alumnus of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">, moved to Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sellers' remorse? Xiaomi's shares soar on second day[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2154566/xiaomi-surges-9pc-after-fastest-ever-inclusion-hang-seng]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The case of DJI reflects Hong Kong's strength in basic research and good universities,” Lam said. “Of course to translate research into practical technology applications, we need more support, whether it's incubation support, venture capital or lab space.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its most recent budget, the Hong Kong government pledged to set aside an additional HK$50 billion to support innovation and technology development this financial year, especially in the areas of biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI), smart cities and fintech, in addition to a HK$10 billion commitment to support the industries from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam stressed that Hong Kong's involvement in the Greater Bay Area, China's scheme for more economic integration between the city, Macau and southern Chinese cities in Guangdong province, would put tech companies like DJI in a place more accessible to research and development capability and venture capital in Hong Kong, as well as the huge manufacturing base of neighbouring cities in Guangdong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Greater Bay Area[https://www.scmp.com/infographics/article/2088829/chinas-greater-bay-area-integration-scheme], which encompasses 65 million people, is currently home to some of China's biggest technology companies, including Tencent, </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> and DJI in Shenzhen. With a combined economy about three times the size of the San Francisco Bay Area, it is expected to surpass the Greater Tokyo and New York areas by 2030 with a GDP of US$4.62 trillion and become a world-class centre for advanced manufacturing, innovation, international shipping, finance and trade, according to the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a government think tank.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To fit into this plan to create a world-class technology hub, Hong Kong has pledged to foster exchanges on innovation and technology with other cities in the area. In early May, Hong Kong announced a talent programme to attract skilled technology workers to the city. More than 700 firms at the city's science parks, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Cyberport, are expected to benefit from the three-year pilot Technology ­Talent Admission Scheme, which starts next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first year a maximum of 1,000 people will be admitted to work in Hong Kong in the fields of biotechnology, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, robotics, data analytics, financial technologies and materials science.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out to Singapore in a survey of regional corporate governance standards because it still does not have an independent audit regulator, according to a joint report by CLSA and the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Corporate Governance Watch 2016 is a biannual study that tracks the corporate governance of more than 1,000 companies across 12 Asia-Pacific markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia, which was included in the survey for the first time, was ranked top with a total score of 78.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore grabbed the second spot with a score of 67, nudging ahead of Hong Kong on 65. Mainland China ranked tenth in the report on 45, ahead of the Philippines on 38 and Indonesia on 36.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong topped the last survey, in 2014, and was also placed first in 2007. Singapore has come out on top in five of the last seven surveys, before Australia was included.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results are based on a survey of fund managers and institutional investors to give scores that evaluate accounting and auditing, corporate governance culture, enforcement and regulatory environment, and corporate governance rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the launch of the report on Thursday, Jamie Allen, secretary general of ACGA, said Hong Kong lost out mainly due to the lack of an independent body to handle the regulation of auditors. The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">, an industry body, currently acts as the regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government wants to shift regulatory responsibility to the independent Financial Reporting Council, but this is unlikely to happen until 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore's accounting and auditing standards are of a high quality and policed by an effective regulator in the </span><span class="s3">Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority</span><span class="s1">,” according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said: “Hong Kong, India and Philippines are the three last markets not yet to have independent audit regulators.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore's recent decision to consider allowing companies with dual-class shares to raise funds on the stock exchange may lead to a decline in its corporate governance standing, he said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong got a high corporate governance rating as its securities regulator says a firm ‘no' to dual class shares, which violate the ‘one share, one vote' principle. Many institutional investors will discount a market if there is dual-share structure,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on the world's largest IPO two years ago when mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list on the New York stock exchange which allows dual-share structures. Hong Kong banned dual-class shares in the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, was denied an exemption in Hong Kong that would have allowed senior executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only owned minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a different legal system and regulation to the US. We cannot allow dual-share structure here just because the US is doing it,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he supports the listing reforms proposed jointly by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, which suggest setting up two new committees with equal representation from both sides. One committee would set listing policies while the other would approve complicated new listing applications.We cannot allow dual-share structure here [in Hong Kong] just because the US is doing itJamie Allen, secretary general, ACGA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen disagrees with opponents of the reform who say it would hand too much power to the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said: “There are many new listings that have corporate governance problems, and the listing reform would help address the problem and enhance market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be better to let the SFC be the sole regulator for listing matters, but it would take a long-term debate for that to happen. The proposed reform would at least be the first step to allow the SFC to work closely with the HKEX to handle listing regulation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another corporate governance weakness in Hong Kong, he said, is the fact there are too few women on company boards. Only 11 per cent of directors are female in Hong Kong, well below the 17 per cent to 43 per cent seen in overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a lot of smart women. It is a question of why so few women are on the board,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global head of thematic research, Shaun Cochran, said the firm's survey of 1,047 companies showed that those with good corporate governance tend to outperform the others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our analysis shows that better governance is associated with better fundamentals,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, accounting firm PwC on Thursday released their own corporate governance report onOur analysis shows that better governance is associated with better fundamentalsShaun Cochran, CLSA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed companies. It showed that Hang Seng Index (HSI) constituents stocks - the largest 50 blue chips in Hong Kong - on average had adopted better disclosure practices and new corporate governance rules than H-share companies, which are constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Chinese Enterprise Index (HSCEI).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The PwC Hong Kong's Risk Assurance division collected and analysed the data of 230 listed companies in the HSI and HSCEI, across sectors including financial services, real estate, retail and technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The study found 86 per cent of HSI-listed companies were early adopters of new disclosure requirements relating to internal control and risk management systems, compared to 60 per cent of HSCEI-listed entities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the reasons that HSI constituents perform better is because substantial emphasis and resources are put into risk management and internal control areas to respond to market expectations and regulatory changes,” said Kanus Yue, PwC Hong Kong Risk Assurance Partner. “The majority of HSI constituents have made an effort to increase their voluntary disclosure beyond the level of mere compliance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This greater transparency and the additional information disclosed helps investors to analyse the overall risk profiles of the companies and facilitates more informed investment decisions.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To cement Hong Kong's position as a financial hub, there is consensus that its stock market could do with reforms to its listing and fundraising regime to enhance both its appeal to start-ups and new economy companies, and protection for investors. But it is now confirmed that reforms will not include the bigger role sought by the market watchdog, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC). This comes after 94 per cent of about 8,500 respondents representing companies, brokers and finance professionals opposed involving the SFC in the early stages of the listing process. In watered down listing reforms announced after a market consultation, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) retains its primary role in approving company listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It remains important, however, to strike a balance between the SFC's concern with investor protection issues such as financial discipline and the quality of companies, and HKEX's need to make the market more attractive for listings by start-ups and new economy companies. In the face of aggressive competition from rival bourses, it was good to hear the secretary for financial services and the treasury, James Lau, say all three parties are open minded about this.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New market for dual-class shares garners momentum after watered down listing reforms[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2111438/new-market-dual-class-shares-garners-momentum-after-watered]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stakes are high. Hong Kong may have been the world's top initial public offering market last year, but financial industry companies were responsible for 59 per cent of funds raised, while technology plays raised the equivalent of 0.8 per cent. In the first half of this year, a lack of new technology offerings saw the city slide to third place for IPOs behind New York and Shanghai. New share sales fell nearly 20 per cent in the six-month period to US$5.6 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This cannot continue if Hong Kong is to avoid losing its status as an international hub. The need to attract more start-ups and new economy firms is paramount. That said, the watered down reforms may clear the way for progress towards this goal by allowing firms with dual-class shares to list on a third board with more relaxed rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market. Dual-class shares enable founders and managers to exercise control at the cost of minority shareholder rights, raising accountability concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There remains the problem of a conflict of interest between HKEX, as a for-profit company listed on its own main board, and its quasi-regulatory role, given that IPOs account for a large part of its revenue. However, the SFC's retention of its role in setting listing policies, plus representation on a panel to support the listing committee, should enable it to stand up for a more effective role in investor protection. It also could go some way towards finding a balance that would counter the perception of conflict of interest without burdening the market with more regulation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's equity capital markets have put in a strong performance for the first nine months of the year, raising almost 45 per cent more than in the period last year. However, many in the market are still focused on what could have been.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s record-breaking initial public offering in the US this month has added impetus to a push for the city to re-examine whether the stock exchange operator should change its listing rules to enable the kind of dual-class share structure that the e-commerce giant had sought for a Hong Kong listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, companies raised US$40.9 billion in Hong Kong's equity markets in the year to September, including IPOs, follow-on deals and convertible bond offerings, a 44.4 increase from the year-earlier period, according to preliminary data by Thomson Reuters. The nine-month haul represents 88 per cent of the capital raised for all of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Follow-on deals, in which listed companies issue new shares to the public and block trades, dropped 26.5 per cent year on year to US$21.2 billion for the period, despite Citic Pacific raising US$6.9 billion in August for its asset injection deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is undergoing a transitional period in which the Chinese city needs to recover quickly from the loss of Alibaba's flotation, the most important event in recent listing history," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY in Hong Kong. He is keen to see more private-sector listings after most state-owned enterprises - a one-timer pillar of the city's IPO market - have gone public over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised US$25 billion in its New York listing, making it the world's biggest IPO, valuing the firm at about US$250 billion based on the first day's trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate over the way Hong Kong handled Alibaba's proposed listing structure has continued to simmer. On one side are those who argue the city should have shown flexibility in accommodating Alibaba's wish for a dual-class share arrangement. Countering that view are defenders of the status quo who say the exchange was right to not bend its rules for the sake of one company, fearing the consequences for investor protection in the absence of US-style class-action lawsuits. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> began consultations on a rule change at the end of last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong lost Alibaba, it did welcome an influx of mainland private companies listing their shares. These firms are drawn to the city to avoid a cumbersome regulatory approval process at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, a number of these small share sales sparked concerns over the quality of the mainland companies coming to the market. Ding Hui, the chairman of retailer Fujian Nuoqi, went missing after transferring HK$291 million in cash out of the company's accounts, soon after Nuoqi's January IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also suffered the embarrassment of missing out on a wave of Chinese internet companies that bypassed the city for listings in the US. JD.com China's second-largest e-commerce firm, raised US$2 billion in New York, and social network platform Weibo raised US$286 million in a US public offering, partly due again to the dual-class issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation now under way over a change to the listing rules comes as the city's exchange tries to play catch-up with its US counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some market professionals are prepared to look beyond the Alibaba setback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mathias Helleu, chairman of 8 Securities, said: "We do not think sentiment in Hong Kong has been dented after the Alibaba IPO listing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, chief executive of Cathay Conning Asset Management, said: "Missing out on Alibaba IPO only had a very temporary impact on the HK stock market sentiment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">, said economic concerns in China and the US Federal Reserve's plan to end its bond-buying programme could affect the listing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first nine months, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> remained the top performer in the Hong Kong equity capital markets, followed by </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said he supports proposals to launch a new board for start-ups on the stock exchange, as he turns his attention to helping students to carry out research in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, whose 10-year career as a minister comes to an end on Friday, will return to where he came from - </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">. He told the Post he has no title yet but the job would involve research and teaching related to fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government a decade ago, he was dean of business management at the university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I first joined the government, I planned to work for a term of five years only, but eventually I served two terms and have worked for 10 years. It is time to make a change in my career," said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 60, now plans to focus on fintech related research and study in an effort to encourage more youngsters to innovate and develop technologies that will help banks, brokers and insurance companies to do business and provide better services more securely and at a cheaper cost.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes this kind of research will encourage more young people to establish their own start-ups. Chan's move comes at a time when proposals by the stock exchange to establish a new board to help start-ups raise funds are under consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would support the stock exchange in introducing a new board to attract start-ups and dual-share structure companies to list in Hong Kong as long as they could introduce investor protection measures to safeguard the interests of the investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) issued a consultation paper two weeks ago proposing a third board - in addition to the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market - which would have more flexible rules to attract ‘new economy' companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board would offer two markets - one for mega listings of big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, the other for start-ups. Both would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter case, Chan said the reason for this restriction on the type of investor is because "the start-up markets are risky."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the board designed for dual-class structure companies, he said if it allowed retail investors to trade, measures should be put in place to protect the investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding structures are favoured by technology giants such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> as their founders own a minority stake but want to maintain control. They issuance of two classes of shares allows the founders more voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Singapore and some other markets have this sunset clause for the dual-class shares structure to protect the interests of investors," said Chan.Hong Kong is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbiChan Ka-keung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government, Chan had spent his entire career in academia. After winning a scholarship in Hong Kong at the age of 18, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from </span><span class="s3">Wesleyan University</span><span class="s1">, and both his MBA and PhD in finance from the </span><span class="s3">University of Chicago</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He taught for nine years at </span><span class="s3">Ohio State University</span><span class="s1">, before taking up a role at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1"> in 1993, eventually becoming dean of business management. He joined the government as secretary for financial services and the treasury in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back over his past decade as a minister, he is most proud of promoting the yuan business in Hong Kong and overseeing the launch of the two stock connect schemes linking HKEX with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a leading offshore yuan centre. It is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbi. The two stock connects have promoted cross-border trading and enhanced Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">James Lau, former undersecretary for financial services and the treasury, will succeed Chan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposed third board to draw technology and new economy firms to list in the city has received a general welcome from market players, but it is too soon to tell how big a draw it will become.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board announced by the exchange in a consultation paper on Friday limits listings to technology and new economy companies, and is intended to plug the gap that the bourse's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market have not been able to fill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The board will consist of two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target large companies that match requirements for the main board but have a dual shareholding structure. US-listed firms with dual share structures can apply for a secondary listing, and retail investors will be allowed to trade in this market.</span></p>

It will have a low entry threshold and light regulatory touch. To segregate the good and poor quality companies, a delisting mechanism will be in place. Firms will be delisted if they failed to meet certain operation requirement, if their share prices fell to a certain threshold, or if they had been suspended from trading for 90 days. This market will only be opened to institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX said that overseas-listed Chinese companies with dual class structure currently banned from listing in Hong Kong, could now opt for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For the longer term, there is no reason why Hong Kong could not attract some big US technology and new economy companies to consider a secondary listing," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he acknowledged that it will be an uphill task as the US is already the largest technology market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the new board will adopt an "easy in, easy out" approach, Li stressed that "the new board will not become a farm of shell companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/6affea34-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]The new board's limitation to tech firms and start-ups aim to achieve what the Growth Enterprise Market was originally intended for when it launched in 1999, targeting the very same types of firms. Eventually, only 18 per cent of GEM firms have links to information technology, while 29 per cent operate in the consumer and services sector and 26 per cent are construction companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the top IPO market worldwide last year but only 3 per cent of funds raised were for technology companies. Five technology firms listed in Hong Kong last year, raising HK$5.7 billion (US$730 million), while the nine GEM technology companies raised only HK$800 million, far below </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">'s HK$15.9 billion, New York's HK$8.7 billion and Shenzhen ChiNext's HK$7.9 billion, according to PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's what different market players say about the third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third new board for new economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">START-UPS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-ups welcome the board but are uncertain if they would list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s internet lending and wealth management provider, Lufax is planning a listing, but is undecided on which market to IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are open-minded about the listing of Lufax. There is no concrete timetable and listing venue about the listing yet," said a spokeswoman of Ping An.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast Education</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alex Lee, a former banker who co-founded online education platform Mast Education with his mother and partners in late 2015, said he relied on his personal savings for start-up funding. While he welcomed the idea of the third board as a new fund-raising channel, his company may not opt for an offering soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Overall, it would be a good move for Hong Kong to have a new third board with the purpose to help start-ups and other new economy companies to raise funds. This would hopefully encourage more Hong Kong young people to set up their own businesses," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast, which aims to provide high school students with university-level courses to boost their learning and be prepared for examinations, has been in operation for nearly two years. It has attracted more than 1,000 users globally, with a large proportion of them from the US, Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said he would wait out till his business was bigger before considering a listing on the third board or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xero</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rod Drury, chief executive and founder of Xero in New Zealand, said unlike Xero which floated in its first year, it was rare for a start-up to go public within a year of being founded. The firm uses cloud technology to help small and medium-sized enterprises better manage their accounting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We did everything backwards. Listed first, then brought in funding from hedge funds and venture funds including </span><span class="s3">Accel</span><span class="s1">, Matrix and TVC," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He recalled that there were few options in New Zealand to secure private capital for a technology start-up when the company was set up in 2006. He and other co-founders funded the firm out of their own pockets, and then listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (</span><span class="s3">NZX</span><span class="s1">) in the first year, followed by the </span><span class="s3">Australian Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">ASX</span><span class="s1">) in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As a technology start-up that went public within our first year, we encourage exchanges and others who offer capital raising options to consider how best they can support high growth businesses like ours with options for capital to support growth," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drury is supportive of the idea of a third board as Xero's own listing has helped the company expand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JabJabX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Yue, who founded JabJabX, an app that stores and analyses data to help users hone their technique in Chinese martial arts, said he and his co-founders tapped on their personal savings of about HK$400,000 to set up the company earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would wait for the details of the third board before deciding if it would seek a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not need to rush to go public because we could find some angel investors or funds who share our mission to become our investors. We would like investors who can provide guidance to us to develop our business and to allow us to access to their network of contacts," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Listing on the stock exchange would help us to raise funds but it could not help us to expand our network. At present, the cost of bank interest rate remains low, so it is not hard to find low cost of funding," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BROKERS AND FUND MANAGERS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - the payment arm of a unit of the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which are considering listings could be potential candidates for the third board's premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange had two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but was quickly rejected by the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC). This time around, the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said they had agreed to the consultation as the listings would be limited to the new board, compared with the previous proposal that applied to the entire market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/60a5aa7e-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]Still, the dual shareholding structure will remain an issue of contention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Investments Funds Association, the industry body of fund houses in Hong Kong, is opposed to such a structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In principle, investment managers believe that "one share one vote" is a cornerstone of investor protection," said Sally Wong, chief executive of HKIFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As for the discussion about the proposed third board, we should not view this in silos, but take a holistic approach and consider the relationships between the different boards. For example, will a third board listed company be "upgraded" to the main board? Or from the start-ups to the "premium" class? If yes, what are the exit or entry mechanisms," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International said the attempt to draw sought-after technology companies to list in Hong Kong had two audiences to placate including the companies and public investor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the balance between the two was not easy to strike, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Voting control through a dual class listing system does not translate into risk nor impropriety. However, the exchange needs to make sure the individual investor's interests are both aligned and protected. The old expression buyer beware cannot be the basis of a regulatory protection campaign because nothing is more paramount in the list of priorities," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Mobius, executive chairman for Templeton Emerging Markets Group, who manages US$26 billion for clients in emerging markets including Hong Kong and mainland China, said he fully supported the HKEX consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A third listing board will give an opportunity for fintech and innovative companies to compete in Hong Kong and share in the success of Shenzhen's ChiNext which has been successful in raising capital for this rapid growing sector of our industry," Mobius said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe dual class shares if structured appropriately, that is where all the rights to the shareholders are commonly shared, will be beneficial to the market as it should allow enterprising companies listed overseas to dually list in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Defining technology firms and the corporate governance that entails would be the issues to address, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The third board concept would be a good idea to attract more technology companies to list but how to define a firm as a technology or new economy firm may be controversial. If a company is conducting online lending services, is it considered as a traditional financial firm or a new technology company?" said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner of EY, said Hong Kong needed to diversify its IPO portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many challenges to the Hong Kong market," Pogson said. "We need to be responsive to the changing financing needs of the market. However this needs to be done in an investor friendly and robust way, as at the bedrock of Hong Kong's success is the quality of process and governance that Hong Kong can bring," Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We need to ensure that are market is ready for changing business models, that we understand markets such as technology, fintech, infrastructure and other evolving financing needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of AIA Group, said international exchanges were competing to attract new listings as the capital markets and the finance industry integrate globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Creating new boards to attract companies under reduced levels of governance and less onerous listing requirements is a hot topic and one that needs to balance the commercial opportunity for the bourse itself and access opportunities for local investors with investor protection and oversight," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology driven businesses have access to many funding sources and international stock exchanges are keen not miss out on what is widely expected to continue to be a dominant sector for growing market capitalisation."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing reforms that would increase the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s power in listing matters are likely to join the list of failed reforms, after they were resoundingly rejected by most of the respondents to a consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals in a joint consultation paper by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the SFC centred on establishing two committees - one for policy and one for regulatory issues - on top of the existing listing committee, with equal representation by the SFC and HKEX, to approve complicated new listings and set listing policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This would upend the current structure whereby HKEX's listing division staff give preliminary approval to a listing and can suggest listing rule changes, which are then submitted to the 28-member listing committee of accountants, lawyers, executives of listed firms and fund managers for final approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposals</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">for fear that the change would allow the SFC to overregulate. As they have in past reforms, the listed companies again led the opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the stiff opposition, the reforms would be difficult to proceed without any modification, and the current deadlock is not a first. Previous failures in the past 15 years have ranged from delisting, quarterly reporting and restrictions on cornerstone investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are the reforms that were proposed and why they failed:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Companies to report results every three months instead of every six months, in line with international practice</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Plan was abandoned one year later after public consultation drew strong opposition from companies, including blue chips such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">. They argued that it would increase costs and prompt the management to chase short-term profits</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Move to delist companies trading below 50 HK cents for a full month</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: HK$10 billion in value was wiped off the market a day after the consultation paper was released as investors rushed to dump penny stocks. HKEX scrapped the public consultation exercise four days later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government accepted an expert group's report on the penny-stock fiasco and decided to shift the listing division and regulatory powers from HKEX to the SFC and remove the conflict of interest of HKEX as a listed company and regulator</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Stiff opposition from companies, brokers and those who feared the change would enable the SFC to become too powerful. The government backtracked and abandoned the plan one month later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government wanted to add part of the listing rules into the law; companies and directors that failed to disclose price-sensitive information could face a maximum 10-year jail term and a fine of HK$10 million</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: With strong opposition from companies and fears of the SFC becoming too powerful, the plan was dropped. In 2010, the government proposed that breaches could be a civil offence with a maximum fine of HK$8 million. The law was supported and enacted in 2013</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce quarterly results reporting in two phases: bigger firms with a market capitalisation of at least HK$10 billion would start in September 2008 while smaller ones would do it in September</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan was dropped after stiff opposition from companies, including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX attempted to restrict tycoons or certain investors from becoming cornerstone investors in initial public offerings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan received stiff opposition from tycoons and investment banks. The regulation has not been tightened and cornerstone investors still have a place in numerous listings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce the British style of quarterly reporting in 2009 where companies give only broad performance outlines. In 2011, it wanted companies to follow the US style of quarterly reporting with more detailed numbers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The proposals were dropped after stiff opposition from the companies including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought to extend the period banning directors from trading shares from two months in a year to up to seven months</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: More than 200 listed companies voiced their opposition with an open letter published in newspapers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought views on whether dual-class share structures should be introduced after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for a listing in New York over Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Mixed views were received. HKEX in June 2015 launched a second round of consultation to allow big companies to have dual-class structures, but SFC banned it a week later. HKEX said it would launch a consultation in the second quarter of 2017 to introduce a third board to attract technology firms and other new economy firms, which would allow dual-class share structure firms to list</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX and the SFC jointly issue a consultation paper to allow SFC to take more front-line role in listing regulation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposal as listed companies, brokers and lawyers generally feared the change would lead the SFC to overregulate and hence hurt the listing market. The SFC and HKEX said they would review the comments before making any consultation</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has edged closer to allowing companies with a dual-class share structure to list on the stock exchange after the regulator backed plans for a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) said on Thursday it supported the local bourse's proposed consultation exercise this quarter to gauge opinion on creating a third board aimed at technology start-ups and ‘new economy' firms.There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board would for the first time permit dual-share listings, which afford one class of shareholder more rights than others. Their long-standing ban in Hong Kong is widely seen as a barrier to potentially lucrative initial public offerings, particularly by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's decision to back the move represents a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it considered the proposal at the time did not carry sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January suggested launching a new third board with more relaxed listing rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board aims to attract three types of entity - infrastructure companies, start-ups and dual-shareholding firms. Li said on Wednesday the consultation paper would be ready soon for SFC approval before it is launched this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC supports the consultation to allow the public to share their views on the dual-shareholding structure," said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC at a media lunch on Thursday. "The SFC will be open minded to listen to the market comments. However, the regulator will only agree with any listing rule changes if it would develop the market and provide sufficient investor protection measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC took a different attitude to the consultation this time around because the dual shareholding companies would only be listed on the third board. Two years ago, the proposed changes would have applied to companies listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also need to consider the worldwide trend," he said. Singapore's stock exchange last October said it planned to consult the market on allowing dual shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using a dual-class structure, which is permitted in the United States. It is favoured by many start-ups because their founders often hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to allow such listings on the grounds that they would violate the long-held principle of "one share, one vote".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request to allow what it considered a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has since said that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs of new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players have mixed views on the issue, with listed firms and investment bankers preferring a dual-share structure while fund managers generally oppose it as they believe it is not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needs," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, who support the dual-share proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the third board consultation should be accompanied by a review of the role of the GEM, Hong Kong's second board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999 with the intention to attract technology firms to list, but it has failed to do so, now acting only as a stepping stone for smaller firms while they wait to grow big enough to move to the main board. Many new listings on the GEM have seen their share prices fluctuate wildly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After setting up the third board, we need to find a new role for GEM. Many companies only take GEM as a short cut to list on the main board. We need to make changes to address the problems of this market," Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's benchmark stock index rose 1.8 per cent to close at a historical high, on optimism the city's stock exchange will see a flurry of initial public offerings from June that will help it regain its crown as the world's favourite destination for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose to close at 31,904.75, surpassing the record previously set on October 30, 2007. Advances were led by banks, property stocks, and a 19.8 per cent increase this year in the stock price of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited</span><span class="s1">, the bourse operator. The HSI is now also only 53 points from reaching an intraday record high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The record close came after HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia unveiled a reform to listing rules that will allow large biotechnology companies without revenue and other new-economy firms to apply to list their dual-class shares in Hong Kong from the end of June.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law of unintended consequences is a curious thing as HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia recently discovered to his cost. Li got himself into hot water with the government which, we understand, was deeply upset by one aspect of his recent blog. As a result, he has had to eat humble pie and issue a "clarification" in which he is reduced to blaming the press for "some confusion" about the purpose of the blog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Readers will recall that we reported on Tuesday that Li had revived the issue of the Alibaba listing and the vast opportunities Hong Kong would lose if mainland technology and new economy companies were not allowed to adopt dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He argued that this had come about as a result of a mistaken view that one share, one vote was "a core principle of the Hong Kong market". To demonstrate this, he cited the example of HKEx. "HKEx itself is not subject to this principle, as the Hong Kong government gets to appoint six out of the 12 non-executive directors and name the chairman, regardless of how many HKEx shares it owns (currently 5.8 per cent)."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This, he says, can be justified on grounds of public interest, and "shareholders' interests are subordinate to public interest".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li possibly didn't couch this in sufficiently reverential terms, but the government appears to have been annoyed with him for subjecting this example of shoddy corporate governance under the spotlight. As Li put it, "On further reflection, it may not have been the best of examples."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The upshot has been that the focus has shifted from the discussion of dual-class shares to his row with the government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not so transparent</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Real estate broker Midland somewhat grudgingly held a press conference this week to discuss its lamentable results. But it was only after pressure from its second-largest shareholder Apex Benchmark, whose senior executives include a number of former Midland honchos. It would have been the first time in about 10 years that Midland would not have held a press conference to discuss its results.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked why the company had originally opted not to have a press conference, chairman Freddie Wong Kin-yip said there was no rule requiring a listed company to do so. "I am very shy and like to keep low-profile. In any case, we are a very transparent company, and you can see everything on our website."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the criticisms levelled at Wong was that Midland was leasing properties from him for its own use at, shall we say, rather full values.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Midland yesterday issued a stock exchange notice reporting lease renewals for two such connected transactions. One shop in Taikoo Shing was rented for HK$102,000 per month, a drop of 6.3 per cent from the previous rent. Another, in Tsim Sha Tsui, saw the rent increase 12 per cent to HK$162,000 per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The price per square foot was not given, which seems a pity given the "transparency" Wong was boasting about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whisky galore</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now for something that every self-proclaimed world city should have - a whisky festival. Hong Kong's first whisky festival - Malt Master HK - takes place this weekend at Crown Wine Cellars at Shouson Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The event is being organised by Ian McKerrow, who comes from a family steeped in whisky, so to speak. His father Neil was chief executive of Glenmorangie and will be speaking at the preview dinner. His mother is a Mackinlay, whose family at one time made their own blended whiskies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a four-course dinner tomorrow accompanied by seven whiskies not normally found in retail outlets in Hong Kong. The seven are Balbair 1983, Bowmore 23-year-old Port finish, Auchentoshan Virgin Oak, Peneryn Original - Madeira finish, Glenlossie 1992, Blue Hanger - malt blend, and The Last Drop, of which there are only 388 bottles and, according to Jim Murray's Whisky Bible, is among the world's top 20 whiskies. The dinner also includes talks from whisky experts. All this for HK$2,500.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are two whisky tasting sessions on Saturday, from 12pm to 3pm and 3.30pm to 6.30pm, where for HK$800 there will be more than 50 malt whiskies from 18 major brands that are available for tasting. For an additional HK$200, one gets to attend a master class. For tickets and more details, go to http://maltmastershk.com/[http://maltmastershk.com/] Enjoy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just five years ago, if someone said Shanghai would overtake Hong Kong as a market for initial public offerings, most people would have laughed. But last year, it beat us for the first time, while New York took the top spot as the world's premier IPO market. That should set off alarm bells if the city wants to maintain its status as a global financial hub. We must make sure this doesn't become a declining trend. Our financial services firms and regulators must be flexible and adapt quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, many market players believe this year will see much improvement, both in the overall stock market and IPO listings in particular. For one, the stock market is anticipating a big boost from the so-called full circulation of H shares. The mainland is expected to lift the ban on major owners selling the shares of state-owned enterprises. This is expected to be a big boost to the H shares market in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's Shanghai and not New York that Hong Kong has to worry about in the 2018 IPO stakes[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125873/hong-kong-falling-behind-ny-ipo-rankings-are-investors-ready]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A second major catalyst is the Hong Kong stock exchange's overhaul of IPO rules, which will allow dual-class shares for listing companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The loss of Alibaba's IPO to New York - which offers dual class-listing - in 2014 had been a painful lesson. The rule change will be especially congenial to hi-tech firms in Hong Kong, more of which are being listed at a rapid rate in recent years. In 2016, technology broke into the top five sectors for IPOs in fourth place, and rose to second behind finance last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Finance IPOs last year took up 36 per cent of share valuation, compared with almost 70 per cent in 2016. But during the same period, technology jumped to 20 per cent from just 3.4 per cent in one year. For the nine technology and internet IPOs on the main board, the average public oversubscription rate was 367 times, in contrast with the average of just 2.2 times for the eight finance IPOs on the main board. The enthusiasm of Hong Kong investors for tech IPOs is set to continue.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the more optimistic forecasts for 2018 is one by Deloitte China, which predicts a jump in the value of IPOs in Hong Kong by 25 per cent to 48 per cent. These translate to between US$20.65 billion and US$24.5 billion, compared with US$16.3 billion last year, the lowest since 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It used to be that New York and London were seen as our biggest competitors. Now, Shanghai and Singapore are posing even bigger challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To stay on top of the game, Hong Kong must learn to attract talent and enhance the overall credibility of the listing market to attract high-quality companies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government yesterday came out in support of the Securities and Futures Commission's stance in the controversy over Alibaba's listing plans and rejected calls to strip the stock exchange of its power to approve listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock exchange has no plans to consult the market about any change in listing rules. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine," Chan Ka-keung, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, said at a Legislative Council meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the law, the chief executive can issue directives to the SFC, meaning the government has the final say on any listing issue, but it has never exercised this power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant lobbied the SFC and the stock exchange last month to be allowed to have a partnership structure that would have let its top executives nominate the majority of board members. The regulators refused to budge, saying there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another. Alibaba has since reportedly been looking at listing in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Legislator Charles Mok, who represents the information technology sector, asked the government if new policies were being considered to attract technology firms to list in the city. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine CHAN KA-KEUNG</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an attack on regulators following the rebuff, Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai said last month: "Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes" and "look forward as the rest of the world passes it by".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan rejected allegations that Hong Kong was lagging behind and said that a number of "high quality" technology firms had listed in the city. "Hong Kong is not the only market worldwide to ban dual-class share structures … Most markets ban such structures," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US is the only market that allows the dual-class share structure. The US regulator, the SEC, in the 1980s appealed to the courts to ban such structures. The court ruled the issue would have to be determined by state law. The US has a different system from Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the legislator representing the financial services sector, asked Chan to consider stripping </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> of its power to approve listings, saying there was a conflict of interest between its obligation to shareholders and its role as a regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have seen many mainland companies facing problems shortly after listing here. The government should consider taking away the HKEx's regulatory role," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said that was unnecessary because the SFC had been monitoring the exchange's approval of listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the stock exchange had officially said "no" to Alibaba's proposal, Cheung said there was concern that it had worked with Alibaba behind the scenes to find a way out of the impasse before it had finally agreed to the SFC's stance against any relaxation of the rules.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The introduction of dual-class technology stock listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely to</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">narrow the valuation gap between Chinese and US technology stocks listed in the United States, says the chief executive of exchange-traded fund manager Enhanced Investment Products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tobias Bland said that thanks to the impending launch of the weighted voting right governance structure by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, he expected several Chinese technology “marquee players” - smartphone giant Xiaomi as well as leading fintech players Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> - and Ping An Good Doctor to list with Hong Kong as their primary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights will also lead to dual listings in Hong Kong by technology companies that are already listed in the US as American depositary receipts, he said. Together, the growing number of technology stocks in Hong Kong will mean that the price-to-earnings multiples of Chinese technology American depositary receipts - and their respective share prices - would be due for an upgrade, said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weighted voting rights structure, which is still not allowed by Chinese regulators, will also incentivise more Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, industry players have long said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we look at Chinese American depositary receipts that make up our exchange-traded funds portfolio, last year they had a 70 per cent run on average in their share prices based purely on their revenue growth, which is about 40-50 per cent on average per year. Yet, they are trading at an average 28-29 times the 2018 expected earnings, which is a big gap compared with the 35 times average of US internet stocks,” said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American depositary receipts are the US dollar-denominated shares of a non-US company. Created by depositary banks, these represent one or several underlying shares from the company's local stock market, and are interchangeable with the underlying stocks.Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuationsJerry Peng, China equity strategist, Citi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors seeking to profit from price level differences between underlying stocks and their US-listed counterparts often create or cancel American depositary receipts through depositary banks. In such arbitrage trading strategies, investors target to profit by selling American depositary receipts trading at a premium to the underlying stock, and buying the underlying stock, or vice versa. Hence, arbitrageurs help to narrow out the price differentials that could exist across the two markets, enabling their prices to often track each other closely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Bland said, the good news for holders of American depositary receipts - such as those of </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, NetEase, Ctrip, Baidu, Alibaba - is that they can expect to see their price-to-earnings multiples getting re-rated by investors in the US market. Tencent, for example, is trading at forward multiples of more than 40 times, and that could be a level that the earnings multiples of other American depositary receipts could match as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the moment, their American depositary receipts performance is often hurt by a general scepticism among US investors about Chinese names,” he said. Contrarily, investors in China and Hong Kong have better understanding of their businesses as frequent users of their services, and such understanding will support Hong Kong-listed technology stocks' performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jerry Peng, China equity strategist at Citi, however, said that while he did not rule out that American depositary receipts might be boosted by strong investor sentiment around more Chinese technology stocks listing in Hong Kong, any such benefits are likely to be short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Offshore investors still look at fundamentals. Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuations,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peng said investors who trade American depositary receipts and Hong Kong stocks will still look at the American depositary receipt levels as reference for valuations, as many leading technology focused investors are still based in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of these American depositary receipt investors trade global technology stocks, including those listed in Korea, Taiwan and China … they already know a lot about these companies. Hence, in terms of knowledge of the issuers they are not significantly disadvantaged to Hong Kong investors,” said Peng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX is expected to launch a formal consultation on the proposed amendments to listing rules that will pave the way for the launch of weighted voting rights during the first quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange is making its biggest push in decades to attract Chinese tech companies. But Wall Street is not fazed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the city fell from the top and slid behind New York and Shanghai in overall dollar volume raised through initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an effort to regain supremacy, the bourse said in December it would relax rules to allow controversial dual-class share listings and let young biotech firms list before they turn profitable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital markets professionals on Wall Street agree that the proposed changes, once they take effect, are likely to make Hong Kong more competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these are not earth-shattering alterations, given their availability on bourses globally for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is largely matching what other Exchanges currently permit,” said Gregg Noel, head of the West Coast capital markets practice at law firm </span><span class="s3">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom LLP</span><span class="s1">, which has advised hundreds of IPOs globally, including Chinese online retailer </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">'s 2014 IPO on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes “will be immensely helpful for Hong Kong to try to take the cream of the crop,” he said, indicating that the rule-easing aims to attract a particular group of fast-growing Chinese tech and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not going to suddenly shift the rest of the global listers' attention entirely to Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma to consider listing Alibaba on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also a less-than-adequate challenge to the US IPO market, which remains the most liquid and mature in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You have the deepest pockets in the US,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management. “The demand is high for Chinese IPOs because the returns are great.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funtleyder's fund, for example, saw its investment in Chinese biopharma company </span><span class="s3">BeiGene Limited</span><span class="s1"> quadruple as the firm's stock rose to US$136 (HK$1,063) after its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> IPO in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US market is also among the most flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong requires every offering to have a retail tranche, US banks can decide whether to sell shares to individual investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, while Hong Kong has a one-week gap between pricing and trading, US shares begin trading the day after they are priced. Both measures help reduce the exposure of companies to US market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class share listing that Hong Kong is expected to introduce has already been offered by many bourses globally for years, including those in the US, Canada, Brazil, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Russia and Finland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1"> opted for a dual-class share structure in its 2004 IPO. Social media company </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1"> took it to an extreme with its US$3.4 billion deal in March 2017 as the first listed company to only issue stock with zero voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such listings, which allow founders of public companies to maintain control of their firms even with minority ownership, have become a favoured tool of tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's unwillingness to provide </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd</span><span class="s1"> with that option largely forced the Chinese e-commerce company to bypass the city for its gigantic US$25.7 billion listing in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bitter loss of Alibaba was a catalyst in a years-long debate over the need for Hong Kong to loosen its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle between Hong Kong and New York for Chinese tech companies' IPOs has intensified as more start-ups have matured and become ready to seek financing through a public offering. The race became more urgent after a number of high-profile companies bypassed Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Ctrip.com</span><span class="s1"> are among the mega Chinese tech companies that have opted for a </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2008, China has been the top source of IPOs by non-American companies in the US; the trend is not expected to slow this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tech has been the biggest sector for Chinese companies listing in the US since at least 2009, according to Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track such data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The country has great tech companies and a strong entrepreneurial culture,” said Bob McCooey, senior vice president of Nasdaq's Listing Services unit. “These founders will be recognised globally when they are listed here [in the US].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early this month, MCooey told the Post that the number of China listings in the US this year was expected to be “materially higher” than a year ago, rising 25 to 30 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hottest American sectors for Chinese IPOs in the year to come will be data centres, streaming businesses, education, life science, wearables and enterprise technology providers, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One high-profile company, Huami, a Chinese maker of wearable devices that has partnered with Xiaomi, went public on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Hong Kong has been losing ground. While US IPOs surged 55 per cent to 174 deals in 2017, Hong Kong saw just a 28 per cent increase, to 149 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">'s December Global IPO Trends report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO growth last year also lagged the 49 per cent average global increase in IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's endeavour to regain IPO market share could hit more bumps as the administration of US President Donald Trump pushes to pare financial regulations to spur economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A top priority for Jay Clayton, the new chief of the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">, the agency responsible for enforcing American securities laws, is to further streamline the IPO process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clayton, a former capital markets lawyer with the New York firm </span><span class="s3">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</span><span class="s1">, advised on Alibaba's IPO. Since taking the SEC's helm in May, Clayton has been actively looking for ways to encourage more companies to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In prepared testimony, Clayton said in June that “fewer companies are choosing to enter the public capital markets than in the past”. The SEC's aim, he said, was “promoting firms' access to capital markets”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July he expanded a programme that allowed all companies seeking to go public to keep their financials private longer, increasing their flexibility in the listing process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street bankers and lawyers have told the Post they believe a further easing of restrictions is on the way. One area being explored is finding ways to shield public companies from potential shareholder litigation, according to people familiar with the discussions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial communities of both Hong Kong and New York are watching closely as a slew of blockbuster IPOs from Chinese technology firms are in line to go public in the next two years, with an estimated total market capitalisation of US$500 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, is talking to banks for its planned listing next year, which could be valued at US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, a financial unit of Alibaba that delayed its 2017 IPO plan, was valued at US$60 billion in its latest funding round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, a Chinese online platform for ordering food and booking movies, and Toutiao, a Chinese news aggregator, are other mega IPOs coming in the next 24 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, when Hong Kong announced its proposed marketplace changes, the move was touted as “the biggest change of the exchange rules since 1993”, when it opened its door for Chinese enterprises to go public there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The emergence of the new economy, particularly in mainland China, is a fantastic catalyst for us to take a closer look at our business and see if we're as competitive and attractive as we can be,” Hong Kong Stock Exchange CEO Charles Li wrote in a blog post last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect companies from the new economy to begin applying for listing under the new rules by the end of June this year,” Li wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early responses have been encouraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This month, smartphone maker Xiaomi was said to favour Hong Kong over New York as the location for its initial stock listing that would be, arguably, this year's most-coveted Chinese tech IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If that happened, Xiaomi, said to be valued at about US$100 billion, would be the first company to take advantage of Hong Kong's newly revamped listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc, a biotech company owned by </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Co, also was reported to be planning a Hong Kong IPO. The offering, expected to occur in the second half of this year, could raise at least US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, Alibaba founder Jack Ma said in January that he would consider listing the company in Hong Kong, during a meeting with city chief Carrie Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong “has made strong progress in attracting more small- and medium-sized companies, a trend that is set to continue,” Terence Ho, Greater China IPO Leader at E&amp;Y wrote in the firm's December report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In particular, it is showing success in turning itself into a listing hub for technology and other ‘new economy' firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's wooing will probably make people think twice about getting listed in New York,E Squared's Funtleyder said,“but the bottom line is, the US continues to have a much deeper market and a really sophisticated investor base.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, the former Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has joined online lender WeLab as a senior adviser, the second top minister to join the budding fintech sector in as many months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining WeLab is Chan's first major private sector commitment since he left the government in July last year after serving in the post for 10 years. He has since returned to academics as an adjunct professor of finance with the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 61, has taken a path similar to former financial secretary, John Tsang Chun-wah, who was defeated last year in his bid to become the city's chief executive, and in June joined fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific as vice-chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan declined to reveal his salary for his role in WeLab, which he took up on July 6 but was only made public on July 16.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said this was not a full-time job and that he could advise other fintech companies as well while continuing to teach at the university. At WeLab he will only help with setting out strategy and will not be involved in the day to day operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I taught at the university in the first part of my career. Then I joined the government for 10 years as a minister. Now I think it is right time for me to open a new chapter in my career in fintech,”Chan said WeLab's office in Sheung Wan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I always promoted fintech when I was in the government. During the past 12 months at the university, my focus has also been on financial technology and start-ups. By joining WeLab, it gives me a chance to put academic theory about financial technology into use,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's decision to join WeLab has a lot to do with his faith in co-founder Simon Loong.The home-grown unicorn - which has a valuation of US$1 billion - will be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), Loong told the Post in an exclusive interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority is now accepting application from new players to set up virtual banks which purely offer services online without any physical branches.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The online lender last week filed an application to list on the main board of Hong Kong stock exchange.Brokers speculate it may raise US$500 million, although the company has not made any comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a start-up which uses big data and other new technology to approve and handle loan approval. It is full of young staff below 30 years old. I like to work with young colleagues to try something new,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said fintech development in Hong Kong has taken huge strides since the HKMA brought in a range of measures last September to promote banks to use new technology to cut costs and enhance their services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chan was in government, e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014 opted for listing in New York instead of Hong Kong as the city at the time did not accept dual-class shareholding companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April implemented massive listing reforms to attract dual-class shareholding companies and biotech tech firms without revenue to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We did all want Alibaba to list here but our regulations would not let that happen. There was no regret as we had to follow the regulations at the time. We do hope after the listing reform of HKEX, we can now attract many of the unicorns to list in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's successful listing marks the beginning of an era for multiple class shareholding companies to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, said it was a positive move for a former minister to join the fintech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fintech is a hot topic in town and has a lot of room for development,” Cheung said. “It will be good to have these experienced government officials join the fintech industry as this will help forge closer ties between the public and private sector and promote Hong Kong as a smart city.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's decision to list in New York has dealt a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange as the highly anticipated listing of China's e-commerce giant is critical for Asia's vibrant capitalist hub to reclaim the global crown for initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a genuine loss for Hong Kong after Alibaba picked the US market to host its long-awaited [listing], which could be the swing factor for global bourses to attain the status of the world's largest listing hub for the year," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY, a professional services firm. "With an expected sizeable share sale, Alibaba's listing can easily be a game changer for Hong Kong, where fast-growing technology firms remain a minority group in the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s US$16 billion flotation in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital raised in Hong Kong's listing market rose 88 per cent year on year to HK$169 billion last year, making it one of the top three listing hubs globally. But the city has struggled to win prominent deals, partly due to a slowdown in listings of international companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Lee, a lawyer at </span><span class="s3">Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft</span><span class="s1">, said Hong Kong still could not get rid of its image as the "listing venue" for mainland-based companies. In one notable example, the Glazer family, owner of Manchester United, had once considered listing the English football club in Hong Kong or Singapore in 2011 before it picked New York as it insisted on adopting a dual-class structure to retain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants agreed that it was time for Hong Kong to review its listing regime but it needed to strike a balance with good corporate governance and investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fund manager with a British fund house said the city should defend the "one share, one vote" system since the overall corporate governance in most Asian countries remained largely behind international standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers said it was natural for Alibaba to list in the United States since the infrastructure, valuations and liquidity there gave it a leg up on Hong Kong, but they argued that the mainland internet giant might still consider a secondary listing in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A total of US$3.8 billion was raised in the US equity markets by mainland technology firms since 2013, compared with US$2.7 billion in Hong Kong, according to Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said: "Theoretically, it is still possible for Alibaba to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange since the firm has not filed any official document to the US regulators, or the firm may choose to do a secondary listing in Hong Kong if the rules permit."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee concurred, saying there was no absolute guarantee that Alibaba would not seek a secondary listing since it had just started working on the US application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital market is getting more sophisticated as well-established companies are offered to list their shares in different jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft, a mainland software firm, is looking to raise about US$300 million through a spin-off of its security software business in the US. The company is also proposing a dual-class structure that would allow it to retain control after the offering.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than a dozen technology and biotech companies could be part of the first batch to apply for a Hong Kong listing under new rules being introduced from next week, according to Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange said on Tuesday[https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/News-Release/2018/180424news?sc_lang=en] that new rules to broaden the listing regime will take effect on Monday, when the exchange will begin accepting formal applications under a system that permits dual-class shares - a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new regime also opens the door to pre-revenue biotech companies, as well as dual-class shareholding companies already listed in the US, such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not know if companies will submit applications on Monday but I believe they will apply very soon after the new listing rules are effective,” said Li, as he announced the conclusions of a one-month consultation process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many companies indicate they are ready to file a listing application. What they are waiting for is the introduction of the new listing regime.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will not be in the single digits, more than a dozen companies will apply,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li believes the first batch of listings under the new rules will take place in June and July, while a second round will happen in the autumn, after the exchange's summer break.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would not confirm if mobile phone maker Xiaomi, as many expect, will be at the front of the listing queue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I have some idea. I cannot talk, as we are the regulator,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-month consultation on the proposed rule changes ended in late March, after receiving 283 responses. A majority were in support of the reform, but some institutional investors and fund houses called for greater protections for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Upon consideration, HKEX said it would require companies with multiple classes of shares to set up a corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent non-executive directors. Its election will be on a one-share-one-vote principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has decided not to adopt a measure that would cap the holders of premium-class shares to less than 50 per cent of the total issued shares in the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The founders or key management who own the premium class of shares could be in the form of limited partnerships, trusts, private companies or other vehicles. But the shares of these entities cannot be transferred to other people or entities not entitled to own premium shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another requirement stipulates that the special voting rights attached to premium shares will be invalid if an individual ceases to act as a director of the company or if they die.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans to have another consultation before July 31, on whether corporations should be allowed to own premium shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange also provided guidelines for the definition of sophisticated investors who can invest in biotech companies, as well as guidelines on cornerstone investors who invest in the companies ahead of an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with mainland exchanges for global fundraising crown[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is launching the reforms to capture more tech listings, in the face of intense competition from mainland China, as Beijing has also launched a scheme to attract tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, however, said he believes companies could opt to list both in Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Lau, a partner and head of capital markets at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China, said there has been strong interest from both Chinese and international companies in emerging sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect there will be at least 10 to 15 new-economy companies listed under the new regime by the end of 2018. The actual number could be higher depending on market sentiment and how fast the listing applicants can move through the vetting process,” said Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While it is possible that some of those companies may opt to list in China, considering the potential deal size, it is also possible that these companies could also have a secondary listing in Hong Kong to take advantage of liquidity in both markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner with US-based law firm Dechert in Hong Kong, also said foreign companies had expressed strong interest in the reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have some US-based clients who have expressed interest to list their China operations in Hong Kong,” he said. “Our clients would like to be among the first batch to list under the new rules. Some may set a listing target in Hong Kong by the end of this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan added that technology valuations may be higher in the US, but that Hong Kong is considered a home market for many Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“International investors can trade shares in these Chinese companies in Hong Kong, while mainland investors can also trade shares of these companies via the Stock Connect,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may be set to its listing rules and introduce the a dual-class share structure in the city, after </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it plans to consult the market on the launch of a third board in an effort to attract more technology and new-economy firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of the agenda is the controversial issue of whether dual shareholding structure should be allowed, said HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Thursday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX consulted the market on a dual shareholding structure two years ago, which would have allowed one class of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eventually the idea foundered, after the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> opposed the proposal due to what is claimed was a lack of sufficient investor protection - a subject which is likely again to dominate discussions this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow poor performers to exit from the new board," Li told a media briefing on Thursday.Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should be [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade. There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow the poor performers to exit from the new boardCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange would be involving the SFC in the consultation process, in an effort to ease their fears last time, and investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will have discussions with the SFC and hope to work out a future direction," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using duel shareholding structures, which are banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request for a shareholder structure, which the commission considered as dual structured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has told the Post that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs or requirements of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse is also planning to launch gold and iron ore contracts this year and a primary connect system aimed at attracting international companies to list in Hong Kong, which could then be offered to mainland investors via the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect links, Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Major international players such as Apple or </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1"> might consider listing in Hong Kong and offering their shares to mainlanders subscribed to a new primary connect system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This will strengthen Hong Kong's listing market and offer more choice for mainland investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in his briefing, Li said the exchange continues to work on reforming the poorly performing Growth Enterprise Market, and is working on a bond connect and one for exchange-traded funds, which again could both be linked to mainland markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> ranked the top tech listing venue worldwide last year with 21 firms raising HK$15.9 billion, followed by the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> with four tech firm new listings worth HK$8.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen's ChiNext ranked third with 23 tech firms listing raising HK$7.9 billion.</span></p>

It should also accept companies that have little revenue or have dual class shareholding structuresBenson Wong, PwC partner</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is despite Hong Kong remaining the largest IPO market worldwide last year after raising HK$19.4 billion, beating both New York and Shanghai. But 69 per cent of that funding was raised from financial firms with only 3 per cent from tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PwC also conducted a 20-year review of the Hong Kong IPO market which showed Tencent is the biggest tech firm to have listed here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM launched in 1999 was initially aimed at attracting technology firms, but it has only really attracted financial and retail company listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benson Wong, a partner with PwC, said the GEM does not meet the needs of technology firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> ranked the top tech listing venue worldwide last year with 21 firms raising HK$15.9 billion, followed by the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> with four tech firm new listings worth HK$8.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen's ChiNext ranked third with 23 tech firms listing raising HK$7.9 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> attracted just five tech firms to its main board raising HK$5.7 billion and nine Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) companies raising HK$800 million last year according to PwC.The HKEX should launch a third board which will only allow professional investors to trade, so the listing rules should be more relaxed. It should also accept companies that have little revenue or have dual class shareholding structuresBenson Wong, PwC partner</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is despite Hong Kong remaining the largest IPO market worldwide last year after raising HK$19.4 billion, beating both New York and Shanghai. But 69 per cent of that funding was raised from financial firms with only 3 per cent from tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PwC also conducted a 20-year review of the Hong Kong IPO market which showed Tencent is the biggest tech firm to have listed here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM launched in 1999 was initially aimed at attracting technology firms, but it has only really attracted financial and retail company listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benson Wong, a partner with PwC, said the GEM does not meet the needs of technology firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrail Group, one of China's largest dental services providers, faces a dilemma on whether to list shares in Hong Kong or New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the eyes of founder and chairman Robert Zou Qifang, Hong Kong's geographical and cultural proximity to the mainland is a clear advantage, but the ban on dual-class shares structure for non-technology firms listed in the city is a major stumbling block.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong's biggest advantage is its proximity and good investor understanding of the mainland market,” he told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The United States' financial market is more mature where investors have a better understanding of growth industries.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After raising US$200 million via four rounds of private share placements since 2010, Zou believes the company is almost ready to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company operates 10 dental clinics in Beijing, and 91 in total across the country, employing 645 dentists. About 30 additional dental clinics are planned to open this year. Zou says he has a target of 1,000 clinics nationwide within the next eight years. The expansion will require 5 billion yuan (US$774.04 million) over seven years to 2025.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be partly funded by partnering with senior dentists working at its clinics, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> last month said it plans to allow technology and “new economy” firms with over HK$10 billion of market value to list with multiple classes of shares carrying different voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change was aimed at attracting more jumbo listings to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zou said given its high-growth nature in an emerging industry, Arrail would try to convince HKEx to let it list while keeping its dual-share structure, adding it was already close to the HK$10 billion threshold after last year's private share sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As high growth firms typically require multiple share placements that severely dilute the original owners' holdings, a dual class shares structure is essential for maintaining our vision and direction,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrail has yet to engaged in talks with HKEx on the matter. Should an agreement fail to materialise, Zou said he would bypass Hong Kong in favour of New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zou expects China's dental service market to grow to 1 trillion yuan by 2030, reflecting an annual growth rate of 19 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's direct oral health care spending per capita was US$9 in 2016, compared to the global average of US$43.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will keep up the drive to attract new technology companies to list shares in the city, even as the benchmark share index stands at the threshold of a bear market, having tumbled nearly 20 per cent from its high earlier this year, according to the head of the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Usually when the stock market is not good, there would be a decrease in IPO activity because many listing candidates will delay their listing plans to wait for the market sentiment to improve. However, we have not seen any decline of our IPO pipeline during the recent market volatility. The number of IPOs in the pipeline remains strong,” said CEO of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This showed the listing candidates still have confidence in the Hong Kong market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, speaking on the sidelines of a conference at the </span><span class="s3">American Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> on Friday, attributed the downtrending stock market to concerns over the widening trade war between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Globally, the economic foundation remains strong. There is no panic selling. The volatility of the market is mainly due to the anxiety of the trade war. I could not comment if this will be a short term phenomena or if it will last for a while,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that while IPO pricing was a factor in any decision to list shares, other considerations also played a role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies want to raise funds to meet their expansion plan and to enhance their competitiveness,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are 240 outstanding IPO applications still active and pending for approval, as at the end of August this year, compared with 198 outstanding applications a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX reclaimed its crown as the world's largest IPO market, surpassing New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the exchange carried out the biggest reform to its IPO rules in more than two decades, enabling the listing of technology companies with dual-class shares, as well as pre-revenue biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms helped attracted three dual-class shareholding companies so far this year, including July's listing of mobile phone maker Xiaomi. Seven biotech companies have applied for a listing, while two have already been completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is good to see the listing reforms have removed the regulatory barriers to allow these companies to list here. Hong Kong will be a listing hub for these technology and biotech companies, so they do not need to go to the US,” Li said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected 20 per cent jump in its net profit during the third-quarter, after its largest listing reform in decades sparked an increase in market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, the local bourse operator and owner of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1">, said that its July-to-September quarter net profit stood at HK$2.44 billion (US$312 million), or HK$1.96 per share, up from HK$2.03 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The earnings beat consensus market estimates of a 4.8 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit to HK$2.13 billion for the third quarter, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first nine months of this year, the HKEX reported net profit of HK$7.48 billion, or HK$6.03 per share, up 34 per cent from a net profit of HK$5.5 billion during the same period a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange operator is on track to achieve a full-year net profit increase of 25 per cent to HK$9.27 billion, according to consensus market estimates by Bloomberg.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Despite the market volatilities this year, the market turnover is still higher than a year earlier, which has brought in higher trading-fee income for the exchange,” said Ben Kwong Man-bun, a director of brokerage firm KGI Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In addition, the HKEX in April carried out the listing reform to allow dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list here. This has boosted up the number of IPOs and helped add in listing-fee income,” Kwong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kwong, however, warned of challenging times ahead because the US-China trade war and interest-rate increases in the US and Hong Kong will continue to haunt the market in the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading fee income stood at HK$4.85 billion, up 40 per cent annually. The average daily turnover in the first nine month was HK$114.7 billion, up 40 per cent over the HK$82 billion in the same period in 2017, according to the HKEX data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing-fee income also increased 38 per cent to HK$1.31 billion in the first nine months this year, up from HK$947 million a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising listing fees resulted from a 46 per cent year-on-year increase in the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) to 166 companies during the first nine months of the year. Total funds raised by these firms rose even higher, by 177 per cent to HK$242.67 billion in the first nine months, the exchange data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong beat New York to reclaim the crown as the No. 1 market worldwide for IPOs in the first nine months of this year, according to data from Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The driving force was the listing reform in April, which attracted three big technology blockbusters in the third quarter. They included China Tower's US$6.9 billion IPOs in August, which is the largest worldwide this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other two IPOs were of dual-class shareholdings companies: smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in July, and China's food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">, which attracted US$4.2 billion in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 47 per cent of IPO funds raised during the third quarter were by either telecommunications or hi-tech firms. In contrast, 61 per cent of IPO funds were raised by financial firms in the same quarter a year earlier, Refinitiv data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are more than 250 companies in the IPO pipeline for next year, including many in the technology sector, Charles Li Xiaojia said during an interview with </span><span class="s3">Bloomberg Television</span><span class="s1"> in Singapore yesterday. At least a dozen biotech companies are expected go public under new rules designed to attract that sector, he said. Hong Kong first-time share sales have raised $32.6 billion this year, the most of any listing venue globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This year is so difficult and yet we have had a record year, and it looks like we're going to end the year No. 1 globally,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two stock connects linking Hong Kong to the mainland brought in revenue of HK$521 million in the first nine months of this year, up 88 per cent from HK$277 million a year earlier. The two connects have linked up HKEX with </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> since November 2014 and with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in December 2016 for cross-border stock trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Revenue and other income surged 27 per cent in the first nine months to HK$12.296 billion, up from HK$9.66 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its expenditure stood at HK$2.94 in the nine month period, up 13 per cent from HK$2.59 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> commodity trading income was down 4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of HKEX were up 1.3 per cent at HK$224.60 at midday close on Wednesday morning before the results were released during the lunch break.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six months after pushing through the biggest change in Hong Kong's listing rules in three decades, what has the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) gained?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its stock price has plunged nearly 19 per cent since April 30 when the reform kicked off, losing HK$60.53 billion (US$7.72 billion) in value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia touted the success of the listing reforms that the exchange operator had pushed through with the city's securities watchdog agency, he described it as the biggest game-changer since 1993, when Chinese companies were able to raised capital in Hong Kong through H shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will not be in the single digits - more than a dozen companies will apply” to raise capital in Hong Kong, Li said at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform opened the way for tech companies with weighted voting rights - commonly known as dual-class shares - and pre-revenue biotech firms to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six months later, Hong Kong's key stock index is in bear market territory, interest rates are up, and the appetite for raising capital has shrunk. As many as 19 so-called Chinese new-economy companies raised HK$115.8 billion in Hong Kong in the first nine months, more than double the HK$53.8 billion raised by 17 Chinese new-economy companies in New York, according to the HKEX data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While that was enough to help Hong Kong reclaim its crown as the world's favourite market for IPOs, it could not have come at a worse time. The market is down, which means most of the companies are trading below their IPO prices, and that has scared other companies away from raising funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four of the five companies that did list under the new rules, including the world's fourth-biggest smartphone maker Xiaomi, either had a flat trading debut, or fell on their first trading day. Online food delivery </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> was the only company to debut at a premium, according to Bloomberg data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even long-term investors had their fingers burnt, as these five stocks had fallen by between 20 to 56 per cent below their IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is definitely a disappointing set of results for the listing reform,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a veteran stockbroker who is also Hong Kong's lawmaker representing the financial services constituency. "The number of new listings under the new regime is far fewer than expected. These stocks are not performing well, and investors have lost money. The benefit of the listing reform is far less than anticipated.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New listing rules likely to attract a dozen applicants in first round, says HKEX chief executive[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2143158/new-listing-rules-likely-attract-dozen-applicants-first]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The failure with Hong Kong's listing reforms wasn't merely the plunging stock prices, but the fact that the city remains the go-to market for Chinese companies, but not anyone else, said Kenneth Leung Kai-cheong, a lawmaker who represents accountants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many tech companies in the US, Israel, Singapore that need to raise funds,” Leung said. "The HKEX should encourage these companies to list here, to diversify our source of listing beyond just mainland China.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li could not be reached to comment. An HKEX spokesman said the exchange is "very encouraged” by the interest in Hong Kong's new listing regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since HKEX's listing reform, Hong Kong has overtaken the US to become the listing venue of choice for China's new economy companies,” the spokesman said, adding that there are nine biotech firms and another two dual-class companies that are in the queue to raise money in Hong Kong. "It is early days but the progress so far is good.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outgoing chairman of the Hong Kong stock market operator said his biggest regret during his six-year tenure was the failure to land the initial public share offering in 2014 of Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow Chung-kong, who stepped down as chairman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, said he hoped that reforms to listing rules announced this week would bring big tech firms like Alibaba to the city's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba is a good company. It was a regret during my term to see HKEX lose Alibaba. I hope the listing reform announced on Tuesday will bring eight or 10 companies like Alibaba to list in Hong Kong,” Chow said at his last media briefing after the AGM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to list in the US rather than Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted under rules at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was met with disappointment in Hong Kong and was the spark for the debate over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what it billed as the biggest listing reform to the exchange in 25 years, HKEX said on Tuesday that from next week it would allow companies with dual-class share structures to list. Such structures are favoured by many tech firms because they allow founders and key managers to keep control even if they hold only minority stakes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said that he would count the listing reform as among his three major achievements, alongside HKEX's takeover of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012 and the setting up of the two Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges that allowed cross-border trading of Hong Kong and mainland China equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX has developed from a local stock market to a global exchange with multiple asset classes,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed on Wednesday at 30,328.15, up more than 30 per cent from the 20,677.16 when Chow took office on April 24, 2012. Its market capitalisation has also risen more than 70 per cent in the period to over HK$34 trillion (US$4.3 trillion). Market turnover in the first quarter of this year stood at HK$146.1 billion, compared with average daily turnover of HK$53.9 billion in 2012.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's new board of directors will elect a new chairman at their first meeting on Thursday. The Financial Services Development Council's chairwoman, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, a former vice-chair of market regulator the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, is widely expected to succeed Chow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What I can say is the overall outlook is positive for the new chairman. As China is going to become the world's largest economy, it will need a world class financial centre and Hong Kong has the conditions to play such a role,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expected blockbuster listing of smartphone maker Xiaomi in Hong Kong looks set to revive the city's fortunes in the global initial public offering (IPO) market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is exactly the kind of poster-boy IPO that the local stock exchange needs to vindicate its most significant changes to listing conditions in decades.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among those changes is the introduction of dual-class share listings, which enable company founders, usually of riskier hi-tech and innovative companies, to retain control after going public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If successful, the IPO of the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker will be a much-needed shot in the arm for our long-standing reputation, now under challenge, as the region's premier finance hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city, overtaken by Shanghai last year for the first time in the global IPO stakes, was still smarting over the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba, the parent of the SCMP Group, in New York in 2014, which holds the record as the world's biggest stock sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Scam alert: Xiaomi's Lei Jun wants to give you US$10 billion[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2144542/latest-china-scam-xiaomis-lei-jun-wants-give-you-us10-billion]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yunfeng Capital Management, the private equity fund of Alibaba's co-founder Jack Ma Yun, is also an investor in Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overhaul in listing rules comes as Hong Kong is eager to retake the IPO crown. Beijing-based Xiaomi is seeking to raise US$10 billion, in a sale that values the firm at US$100 billion. This will make the IPO the 15th biggest in the world and the fourth largest in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About a dozen mainland and overseas start-ups have expressed interest in listing in Hong Kong under the new rules. At least two Chinese biotech companies are expected to switch their New York IPOs to Hong Kong to raise a total of around US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which is expected to list in July, is no doubt a real catch for the stock exchange. But authorities should not let it go to their heads. Dual-class share structures deny holders of ordinary shares the same voting rights.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While informed investors may be willing to take the risk, authorities must make sure such ownership structures do not become a back door for dodgy or low-quality companies seeking a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vigilance must be kept up to make sure such companies are innovative and deserving. Otherwise, our international standing will suffer in the long run.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi staged a dramatic turnaround on its second day of trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's market capitalisation surged to HK$425 billion (US$54.2 billion), breaking into Hong Kong's top 10 companies, after the stock was added to widely tracked the FTSE China A50 Index, and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect schemes as soon as this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure quickly rebounded on Tuesday to as much as HK$19.34. It closed at HK$19. On its debut on Monday, it fell 1.2 per cent below the offer price of HK$17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The turnaround was quite surprising as it was just the second day of trading and the fundamental has not changed at all,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “It's mainly due to short-term capital inflows, after it was added to FTSE and HSCI indexes, prompting some funds to chase it before the additions take effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yip said the FTSE China A50 Index is tracked by many passive ETFs, which means they will have to rebalance their portfolios to accommodate the change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share surge has helped Xiaomi break into Hong Kong's top 10 most valuable listed companies, a league that includes </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, AIA, and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">. Xiaomi ranks No 9 at its current market cap, ahead of </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading volumes also soared, with more than HK$9.8 billion worth of shares changing hands on Tuesday, 27 per cent higher than the HK$7.7 billion on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change in fortunes came after index compiler FTSE Russell announced that it would include Xiaomi in a number of its indexes with effect from July 16, including FTSE China A50 Index, which is tracked by nearly US$7 billion worth of funds globally. Consequently, it will remove US sanctions-hit ZTE from the FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday afternoon, the Hang Seng Indexes Company also said that it would add Xiaomi to the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) with effect from July 23. The HSCI family has more than 400 constituents, covering over 90 per cent of Hong Kong stock exchange's market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a constituent of the HSCI, mainland investors will be able to buy Xiaomi shares via the Stock Connect programme, provided Chinese authorities grant approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macquarie, which issued a research report on Monday, set Xiaomi's target price at HK$30, as it expects the company's earnings per share to post a compound annual growth rate of 40 per cent between 2018 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank's analysts said Xiaomi can monetise its large number of active users via various internet services, such as online games, apps, ads, which could be its biggest strength compared to its peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company can benefit from rising profit margins in internet services business for the next three years and its continued smartphone sales growth in India, Europe, and Chinese markets, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi has 190 million monthly active users for its mobile operating platform, according to the company's founder and CEO Lei Jun.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi fell below its offer price on Monday, after its much-anticipated IPO received a lukewarm response amid a weak market, as the company's categorisation of “internet firm” and valuation sparked a close examination by investors and regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Index compiler MSCI said last week it will not add Xiaomi to its benchmark index because the company does not meet the criteria due to its weighted voting rights (WVR) structure. WVR, also called dual-class shares, allows a company's founders or executives to have control even if they have minority shareholding.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When a long-held principle no longer reflects the investment reality of new-economy companies, regulators may be forgiven to want to loosen the rules. Companies with different classes of shares may be allowed to list on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange by the middle of next year under a new pilot scheme. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> has had a change of heart about the sacred principle of "one share, one vote", established as a cardinal rule of share ownership in Hong Kong since at least the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A consensus has also emerged among the commission, the government and the stock exchange that it is not necessary to create a new board for listing such companies. Hong Kong has been facing intense competition from rival bourses in such places as New York, Singapore and Shanghai, which have long allowed listed companies to hold dual-class share ownerships. Such share structures enable company founders and/or the management to exercise strategic control even if they don't own a majority stake. Many new-economy and bio-tech companies favour such arrangements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Hong Kong still insists on "one share, one vote", it will be in danger of losing out on the highly lucrative market for initial public offerings. It has lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for IPOs this year, having fallen behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first half of the year, the city's stock market raised just US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, down 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised during the same period last year, when it was ranked as the world's top market for new listings. Indeed, it is still smarting over the IPO of Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] Group Holding, the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post, which skipped the Hong Kong bourse in favour of staging its record US$25 billion flotation in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the new scheme, some start-ups that have reached valuations of over US$1 billion will be allowed to raise capital on the main board. But there will be protection provisions that may include a sunset clause forcing such companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They will also list with a special code to distinguish them from more traditional companies, to help investors identify potential risks. The scheme may expand if enough high-quality companies are attracted to list in Hong Kong without regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The commission's U-turn is welcome. People ought to be able to invest in promising companies with dual shares, provided they know what they are getting into. Transparency is key.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global institutional investors are urging Hong Kong not to change its listing rules even after losing the mega listing of e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to a survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those surveyed, 54 global institutional investors managing a combined US$14 trillion of assets, warned they would on average give a 19 per cent price discount to Alibaba's valuation if it lists with its special shareholders structure intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They also said they would on average put a 13 per cent discount on the Hong Kong market valuation if the city allows a non-standard shareholder structure to accommodate Alibaba-like listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong government and regulators should do nothing with the existing listing rules. The one-share-one-vote principle in Hong Kong has worked well for many years, providing all shareholders with fair treatment," said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the association, which has 100 global institutional investor members including some of the world's largest fund houses, pension funds and insurers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey, conducted on association members early this year, came after Alibaba was reported in October to be in talks with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange refused to grant the exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle. Alibaba last month said it planned to list in the US, which allows the dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba lists with the structure, 71 per cent of respondents said they would not buy the stock or buy it at a discount ranging from 5 to 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia has written several times on his blog since September on the need to relook at listing rules for "innovative" companies, but institutional investors are opposed to any change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Twenty-eight per cent of the respondents gave a "bad" rating to HKEx in its manner of handling Alibaba, compared with 2 per cent "bad" each for the SFC and the government. In comparison, 41 per cent ranked the SFC "good" in its handling of the Alibaba issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Cheng, the association's research director of mainland China and Hong Kong, said some years ago London had allowed the dual class structure but that did not lead to more listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Chan, finance partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Berwin Leighton Paisner</span><span class="s1">, said: "In the US, there is a more disclosure-oriented approach as well as a culture of litigation. Investors don't need the exchanges to protect them as much as they do in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the operator of the city's stock exchange, has signed an agreement with Beijing's over-the-counter exchange, the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), marking the latest effort in its bid to land more mainland technology start-up listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NEEQ, also known as the “new third board”, was created in 2012 to help fund innovative start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of last year, 11,600 firms had signed up to trade on it, raising 400 billion yuan (US$63.53 billion) since inception.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed on Saturday between the two, comes just days ahead of HKEX announcing the conclusions of a public consultation (on Tuesday) on what's likely to be its biggest listing reforms in three decades, including the green light for dual-class listings in Hong Kong for technology and biotech firms, even those without revenues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Friday that firms will be allowed to apply for listings from April 30, while issuing an invitation to tech companies already listed on NEEQ to apply to float shares in Hong Kong too.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong exchange to accept listing applications under new rules from April 30, chief says[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142536/hong-kong-exchange-accept-listing-applications-under-new-rules]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The MOU outlines the creation of a long-term cooperation mechanism by HKEX and NEEQ which will allow a strengthening in their information sharing, regulatory collaboration, and joint efforts in investor education.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The agreement was rubber stamped by HKEX's head of mainland development Mao Zhirong and NEEQ's general manager Li Ming, in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The signing shows both the mainland and Hong Kong are determined to establish a more open and multi-layered capital market,” Charles Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is an open market with clear and transparent listing rules and procedures. We welcome all NEEQ companies that meet our requirements to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We look forward to strengthening our information sharing and collaboration on regulatory matters. We also aim to cooperate on investor education initiatives.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hong Kong-based brokerage Hantec Pacific, welcomed the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology companies now listed on the new third board in Beijing have already approached Hong Kong brokers to arrange listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The MOU and the listing reforms [to be announced on Tuesday] will help attract more of these technology companies to list in Hong Kong this year,” Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While new third board start-ups can also opt to list in Shanghai or Shenzhen, Tsui added he was confident HKEX offers a more attractive proposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to mainland regulations, these new third board companies would need to delist from there before they could list in Shanghai or Shenzhen,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong exchange eyes new role to keep its edge over rival bourses[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2102710/hong-kong-exchange-eyes-new-role-keep-its-edge-over-rival-bourses]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX, however, would allow them to list while continuing to trade on the new third board. Hong Kong listing rules are more flexible than those in the mainland.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite many of the likely candidates being small in size, Tsui said they will qualify to list on what is effectively Hong Kong's own ‘second board', the Growth Enterprise Market, which does not require companies to be in profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main board requires applicants to have registered over HK$50 million (US$6.37 million) in profits for the three years before listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“New third board technology firms can be a new source for the GEM. When they grow bigger, they could then move up to the main board. This will help Hong Kong achieve goal of becoming a hub for tech listings,” Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li has vowed to overtake New York's tech-led </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> exchange in size within five years. It faces stiff competition for the accolade, however, with Singapore, Shanghai and Shenzhen already jostling hard to win more tech listings.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government has kicked off the city's biggest auditing regulatory reform in a decade, with the aim of positioning Hong Kong as a hub for technology initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the Financial Reporting Council (Amendment) Bill 2018, which the government gazetted on Friday and is to be presented before lawmakers on Wednesday, the Financial Reporting Council will be empowered to inspect, investigate, as well as discipline auditors in more than 2,000 listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council will take over these additional powers from the industry body, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">. When the council was set up by the government in 2007 it only handled investigations, while other regulatory functions were carried out by the institute. Under the reform, the institute loses all regulatory powers over auditors of listed companies to the council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Bill will enhance the existing regulatory regime for auditors of listed entities, allowing them to be independent from the audit profession, thereby providing better protection to investors. This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and capital market,” said James Lau, the secretary for financial services and the treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies seeking to list dual-class shares may get green light to apply for Hong Kong listing by end June[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2128434/companies-seeking-list-dual-class-shares-may-get-green]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Benchmarking against international standards and practice, the new regime will also enable Hong Kong to be eligible for joining the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators, which is an important forum for international cooperation on the regulation of auditors,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The auditor regulatory reform comes at the same time as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates the city's bourse - the third largest in Asia - is also carrying out its largest reform in three decades, to allow dual-class shareholding companies and large biotech firms without revenue to list as Hong Kong competes with the United States for more technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both moves are aimed at improving the quality of Hong Kong's stock markets as the city attempts to attract more giant technology companies to list and more mainland firms to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lagged behind other financial centres such as New York, London and Singapore because of a lack of an independent auditing regulator. This is also why the city lost out to Singapore in the Corporate Governance Watch 2016 rankings in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The introduction of this legislation is in the best interest of the investing public. This much-awaited reform for auditors of publicly listed entities, i.e. from self-regulation to independent oversight, will bring Hong Kong's auditor regulatory regime in line with other major capital markets worldwide, such as New York and London. It will further entrench Hong Kong's status and reputation as a robust international financial centre,” said John Poon, the council's chairman.This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and capital marketJames Lau, secretary for financial services and the treasury</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">, however, raised a number of concerns on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On funding, HKICPA feels the proposed HK$90 million annual budget, a three-fold increase [from current levels], requires further substantiation. Judging from our own experience in regulation, inspection and discipline, the figure seems very high,” the institute said, adding that the government needed to be more forthcoming and transparent about funding, so that everybody knew their respective contributions were reasonable and fair.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A number of our member firms continue to have concerns over the maximum penalty of HK$10 million, which they believe will impose an undue financial burden on smaller firms. Last, but not least, it is not clear how non-Hong Kong auditors will be regulated.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The institute said it would keep on pursuing these issues during the legislative process.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's top destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) during the first quarter, as an absence of blockbuster listings allowed the city to be overtaken by New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sixteen companies chose to list their shares in Hong Kong in the first quarter, raising US$1.5 billion of capital, far behind the 14 IPOs in New York with US$9.6 billion raised. New York's haul was bolstered by </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">'s US$3.9 billion IPO in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai ranked second, with US$4.8 billion, while Shenzhen's ChiNext exchange ranked third with US$2.2 billion raised from technology companies and startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There wasn't any big IPOs in the first quarter, while the HKEX and the Securities &amp; Futures Commission tightened their approval procedures of new listings in both the Growth Enterprise Market and the main board,” said Joseph Tang Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The drop in ranking, as well as the reduced fee income that follows, puts pressure on HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to quicken the process for establishing a third board in Hong Kong, with a more relaxed set of rules including the possibility of dual-class shares, to attract technology companies to raise capital here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the Hong Kong securities watchdog had been conducting a process of public consultations since last year, obtaining public feedback on the best way to change the city's listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook Inc</span><span class="s1"> and Snap adopt dual-class share structures, banned in Hong Kong, but allowed in other markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's capital-raising rules are outdated, more suitable for traditional companies like property developers instead of technology and fintech companies, Alibaba's chairman Jack Ma said last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first-quarter total equity funds raised, including IPOs, share placements and rights issues, dropped 26.6 per cent to an 11-year low of US$5.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should study how to relax its listing rules to attract more my firms to raise their capital here,” Tong said. “Otherwise the local IPO market will wither.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong beat New York for the first time in 18 months to reclaim the crown as the No 1 market worldwide for IPOs in the first nine months of this year, as the listing reform led to a slew of companies raising funds in the city, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This also marked the first time Hong Kong has risen to the top of global IPO rankings since it fell to fourth place in the first quarter of 2017 behind New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the quarterly data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eighty-four companies raised US$28.6 billion through IPOs on </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s main board in the first nine months of the year until Wednesday, up 220 per cent from the US$8.93 billion raised a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York, the top IPO market worldwide since the first quarter of 2017, dropped to second place as 48 companies raised US$25.1 billion during the first nine months. </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> ranked third at US$18 billion while Shanghai took fourth place at US$10.44 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The driving force behind the HKEX's IPO boom was the listing reform in April, which attracted three big technology blockbusters from July to September. About 42 per cent of IPO funds raised so far were by telecommunications firms, hi-tech firms accounted for 5 per cent, retail 19 per cent, financial 13 per cent, real estate 7 per cent and others accounted for the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A year earlier 61 per cent of the funds were raised by financial firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest global IPO so far this year was telecom tower operator China Tower's US$6.9 billion fundraising in August, the biggest since </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$7.6 billion Hong Kong listing in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse, which implemented its biggest listing reform in 25 years in April, allowing companies with dual shareholding structures, new economy as well as the biotech firms without profit or revenue to list here, attracted two mega dual-class shareholding structure companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smartphone maker Xiaomi launched its US$5.4 billion Hong Kong IPO in July and China's food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised US$4.2 billion this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class shareholding companies allow founders and key management to own shares with more voting rights than other shareholders which is favoured by many technology and new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city was the No 1 IPO market worldwide from 2009 to 2011 as well as in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with main board and GEM, funds raised by 144 IPOs in Hong Kong stood at US$29.1 billion in the first nine months, up 208 per cent from a year earlier. It was also the highest amount raised in a decade, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific, said IPOs in Hong Kong will continue to grow but warned of difficulties ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many companies have been rushing through with their IPOs in recent months. The real reason behind the strong IPO market may be that the listing hopefuls have a bearish outlook.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that many IPOs in recent months could only fix their offer price at the low end and some have seen their shares drop below the offer price on debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark indexes of both Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges this year have dropped more than 20 per cent from their peak and briefly entered bear markets, as the ongoing US-China trade war has hurt investment sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, however, is more positive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It expects the strong IPO momentum in Hong Kong to continue in the coming months as the listing reform gives many tech and biotech companies more flexibility, said Edward Au, co-head of Deloitte China's national public offering group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deloitte estimates a total of 220 new companies, including 10 unicorns, to launch their IPOs this year, up 33 per cent from last year. These companies are expected to raise about HK$300 billion (US$38.41 billion), up 134 per cent from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is likely to remain at the top of the PO ranking for the rest of this year,” Au said, but he cautioned that the ongoing US-China trade war is dampening overall investment sentiment in Hong Kong and this could make investors think twice whether to buy biotech firms that are yet to register revenue or profit.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local stockbrokerages and banks are jockeying to attract business from retail investors seeking to get in on the share sale by smartphone maker Xiaomi this week, rolling out special discounts and fee waivers tied to the subscription drive for the US$6.1 billion IPO, the largest of its kind globally for two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Individual retail investors can become owners in the company for as little as HK$4,444.33 (US$566.32), representing a single lot of 200 Xiaomi shares, available during the subscription period which runs from Monday until Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks and brokers could be the biggest winners from the blockbuster offering. The Xiaomi initial public offering [IPO] could bring in commission income of HK$479.3 million among the more than 500 stockbrokers and banks involved, based on the assumption that they receive an average 1 per cent of commission and that the offering prices at the top end, raising HK$47.93 billion (US$6.1 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial firms also stand to benefit from interest payments from investors who borrow on margin to subscribe to the IPO.</span></p>

They could also get new customers from the blockbuster IPO,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector who is also a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, my brokerage firm has not received many enquiries from investors about the IPO. This may be because the overall stock market sentiment last week was not good due to the worries over the trade dispute between the US and China. The valuation of Xiaomi is also very aggressive. Investors need to beware of the risks involved in the IPO,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi could raise up to HK$47.93 billion by offering 2.2 billion shares to global investors this week</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">at an indicative price range between HK$17 and HK$22 each. The company will be the first to list in Hong Kong under new rules that permit the dual-class shareholding structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Emperor Capital Group, a local brokerage, will waive administration fees for investors who subscribe for at least five lots, or 1,000 shares of Xiaomi. New customers can also trade Xiaomi commission free between July 9, when the shares are due to debut trading, until July 31.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ICBC Asia will waive fees for online subscriptions to the IPO from Monday to Wednesday, while it will waive commissions for investors who trade the share on its debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bright Smart Securities will offer a competitive interest rate for investors who borrow on margin to subscribe for shares in the IPO, while new customers can enjoy commission-free trading on all Hong Kong shares for seven months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> will extended IPO subscribers HK$390,000 in margin lending for the sum of HK$208.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Everbright Sun Hung Kai has set aside HK$10 billion to support margin lending for Xiaomi share subscribers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, not all brokers are optimistic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The price earnings ratio of Xiaomi is unreasonably high when compared with its peers. Our firm doesn't offer any incentive for retail investors for the Xiaomi IPO,” said Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor's IPO in April was popular with investors, but the share has since slipped below its offer price which could affect investors' confidence, brokers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alfred Yeung Ping-kwan, founding chairman of Glory Sky Group, said his brokerage's clients are not eager to subscribe to the Xiaomi IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO is being priced at an indicated range of 22.7 times to 29.3 times Xiaomi's forecast 2019 earnings. If it could priced at the top end, it would be more expensive than the current valuation of Apple and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) is working closely with both Hong Kong and mainland regulators on further moves to try to connect mainland and foreign investors with each other, Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, told an audience at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Securities Institute</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companies,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to his plans, HKEX is considering the creation of what's being dubbed “Primary Connect” - a programme which would allow mainlanders to subscribe for new shares listing in Hong Kong, which in turn will hopefully attract more international firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He refused to give any further details or a timetable on this latest “Connect” initiative, and declined to confirm if those international companies already listed in New York or London, would be able to make secondary listings or secondary share placements via the proposed plan.Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companiesCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange already has two “Stock Connects” in place with their counterparts in Shanghai and Shenzhen, allowed cross trading of shares between the exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also kicked off its “Bond Connect” programme in July which allows mainland Chinese bonds to be traded by international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This [new plan] still needs a lot of parties to discuss the details. What I can say is this new Primary Connect will benefit both the Hong Kong and mainland markets,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li and HKEX have already prioritised their desire to increase the number of major international players listing in Hong Kong, as well as helping more mainlanders to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major exchanges around the world, including Hong Kong, are licking their lips especially, over the prospects of hosting the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of energy giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, expected to be the largest IPO ever when it floats in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market is the third largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation but it is dominated by mainland companies, which take up 60 per cent of its total value with the rest predominantly Hong Kong companies, and a few international listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, say they are working flatout together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for foreign firms, especially new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed the consultation for a plan to launch a new board, referred to as the “third board”, for dual class shares companies or those newly start-ups without profit to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe for Hong Kong to be a serious contender to land the Aramco IPO, or any other major multinational IPO for that matter, regulators would need to design the planned Primary Connect in a way to allow foreign listed firms to have secondary listings or placements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also needs more diversify in its mix of constituent company listings, argue brokers, illustrated well with the fact that 56 per cent of the funds raised in the first half were by financial firms, and less than one per cent from new economy or technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments we have received so far show there is a consensus that Hong Kong cannot afford to miss any opportunities to act as a fundraising hub for new economy firms,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said it would still need a second round of consultation on the details of the new third board before it could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board is proposed to contain two markets - one is for big companies with dual share structure for all investors to trade and another is for start-ups for professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many commentators consider the planned start-up market is a risky tactic, while others think dual-class share companies should be more encouraged to list on the main board, rather than the planned new one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said the bourse could also opt for what he termed a “landing zone” approach to make some change to the proposal regarding the third board plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To the millions of mainland investors frolicking in China's go-go stock market of the early 2000s, given a kick start from the country's membership in the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">, Laura Cha Shih May-lung was the killer regulator anointed by Beijing to crash the party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, whose married name rhymes with the Chinese word for inspection, soon earned the moniker of the regulator who would “inspect miscreants to their death”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though her tenure as a vice-chairman at the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">from 2001 to 2004 drew mixed responses, it earned her a place in the history of China's capital market development - the first Hongkonger and non-mainlander to take on a vice-ministerial position within the central government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week, the 68-year-old grandmother of three was elected unopposed as the first woman to chair </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the operator of the stock market, in the bourse's 127 years of history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha's ascent comes at a critical time. The exchange is striving to strengthen its relevance and position as the go-to market for mainland companies in the face of increasing competition from global and regional exchanges, as well as China's Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Increasing integration of the Hong Kong and mainland markets, pinned by the city's Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges since 2014 and 2016, makes China a partner but also a rival as the latter wants to bring home some its biggest overseas-listed companies through depositary receipt issuance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) are instituting much-needed listing reforms to entice new economy firms, particularly technology and biotech ones from the mainland, while cleaning up irregularities and excesses.Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to playLaura Cha</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they are also increasing their collaboration with the CSRC to crack down on cross-border frauds, including going after what Beijing calls “big crocodiles”, or wealthy corrupt mainland businessmen who manipulate the capital markets for illegal gains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means Cha has one big balancing act to tackle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pointing to her previous roles at the SFC and the CSRC and now with HKEX, Cha argued that they all differed but did not conflict, as each institution worked towards the common objective of ensuring that Hong Kong's financial markets grew robustly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to play,” she said on Thursday at a media briefing after she was elected chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha also said she would draw on her CSRC experience and mainland network to enhance communication between Hong Kong and China and foster stronger cross-border cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In fact, the cross-border cooperation has never stopped since the launch of H shares 25 years ago,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, Cha has made mapping a three-year strategic plan one of her top priorities in the first 100 days in office, to look at how to enhance the exchange's competitiveness from 2019 to 2021 and fend off competition from other overseas exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/9092235e-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the Hong Kong stock market gained 36 per cent last year, it lost its initial public offering (IPO) crown, which it held for the prior two years, to New York, as IPO value dropped to its lowest since 2012. The loss was in part due to the ban on allowing companies with dual-class shareholding structures, commonly preferred by tech firms, to list since the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To regain the sweet spot, HKEX officials, with the SFC's support, have proposed to lift that ban on Monday, under new rules that would also allow biotech firms without revenue to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Long-time rival exchange Singapore also announced in January that it was allowing dual-class share firms, in line with the global trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Needless to say, the job facing Cha is anything but easy, as she will have to oversee one of the exchange's most crucial turning points in its more than a century history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha's major challenge as HKEX's new chairman is the listing reform. Although the HKEX has announced the new rules, the new listing regime has yet to be tested. The challenge for her is to make sure the regime will be implemented smoothly and to attract many new economy companies to list here,” said Bonnie Chan, a partner at law firm Davis Polk. Chan has worked with Cha since 2013 as a council and committee member of the Financial Services Development Council, the government's advisory body on financial issues that Cha still heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“She has strong leadership and is capable of drawing on a pool of professional talent to work for the council … We could not have done so much work without Cha's ability to draw the many professionals to voluntarily do the job,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said she would step down from the council once the government had found a replacement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the council, Cha, a career financial regulator, had served on the HKEX board from 2006 to 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/8b50afb4-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha had a relative late start to her career to focus on bringing up her two children and being a full-time housewife for six years in the US where she then lived.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was so hard to get help in the US, and as a mother of two I had to be a full-time housewife. I only started my career after my children went to school,” she had said in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was during that period that she became interested in law and returned to school to read law. She qualified as a lawyer in the US before returning to Hong Kong in 1985, when her businessman husband Victor Cha Mou-zing was called back to run the family business, </span><span class="s3">HKR International</span><span class="s1">, the developer of Discovery Bay on Lantau Island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha went to work at a law firm before joining the SFC in 1991, where she stayed till former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji invited her to join the CSRC in 2001. During the decade to 2000, the HKEX and the SFC had garnered extensive experience and expertise in bringing Chinese state firms to market and instilling corporate governance in the process, while weathering the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's stock markets, created in the 1990s with the aim of raising funds for ailing state-owned companies, have long been plagued by insider trading and illicit deals. Wu Jinglian, a renowned Chinese economist, once described the market as a “casino”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha was paid up to 5 million yuan (US$790,557 at current rates) for her CSRC role, in a specially-approved remuneration package that was several times more than what even the Chinese president was earning, according to mainland Chinese media. She took the equivalent salary of her fellow deputy regulators, and donated the remainder of the pay to a fund for educating Chinese regulators, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Cha struggled to implant mature, Hong Kong-style regulatory practises in the mainland to weed out rampant insider trading in the three years she was at the CSRC, as they would have ruffled vested interests. Changing China's broader political, economic and legal framework remains a tall order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But many Chinese investors would hold her as “Hong Kong's iron lady” who helped drive mainland stocks to a three-year bear market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/96617ac8-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We knew of her as the ‘iron lady',” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai who has been tracking China's stock market since 1998.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not fair to blame the bear market on her, maybe it was a coincidence. No one is powerful enough to let the market rise and the purpose of getting her here then was to strengthen market oversight, not to create a bull market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha returned to Hong Kong after her stint at the CSRC, and has been a member since 2004 of the Executive Council, or cabinet, of all four of the city's chief executives: Tung Chee-hwa, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, Leung Chun-ying and incumbent Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While her return to lead the HKEX has been met with positive responses by her supporters and the exchange's chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, who was recruited nine years ago by a panel that Cha led, her work would inevitably be pitted against predecessor Chow Chung-kwong. In his six years as chairman - the maximum term for any government-appointed director - Chow oversaw the acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and the launch of the Stock Connect programmes.Cha's major challenge as HKEX's the new chairman is the listing reformBonnie Chan, Davis Polk</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said she might struggle to understand the needs of smaller players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha was a former SFC head and she has a regulatory mindset. She does not understand the difficulty that many of the 500 local players have in competing with international big players,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker representing the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope Cha would focus more on promoting the financial services industry in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever the challenges, Cha is seen likely to rise above them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ermanno Pascutto, who recruited Cha to the SFC and is now director of the Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights, described her as “very adept” at dealing with senior leaders and executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Laura is the sort of person you could send to New York, Beijing or to talk to Legco [Legislative Council] and she would do a creditable job in all of them,” Pascutto said an earlier interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are few people who could pull that off.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore could be where start-ups prefer to set up shop, but Hong Kong is the market that they want to list in, according to analysts and industry players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Singapore government</span><span class="s1"> has introduced many measures to support start-ups, which is why it has attracted many new companies to set up there. However, these start-ups would get bigger and want to go public, Hong Kong is a better choice as the overall market size and new listing activities are more active in Hong Kong than in Singapore," said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore in terms of drawing start-ups to establish on its turf. The latest case is Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange, or Lufax, the peer-to-peer lender that was established by Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm was last month given the green light to launch a global wealth management platform by the </span><span class="s3">Monetary Authority of Singapore</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the overall Hong Kong IPO market is more robust. It has raised four times more funds than Singapore so far this year, totalling US$8 billion in 92 IPOs. The island republic has raised only US$2 billion from 13 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is the world's fourth-largest IPO market worldwide while Singapore is not even in the top 10 list. But the flip side is Hong Kong is losing out in the amount of funds raised from technology IPOs as Singapore is ranked fifth, while the city is in the 12th position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is because the majority of funds raised in Hong Kong IPOs were from traditional firms with financial firms representing 56 per cent of all IPO funds raised this year, while technology firms only represented 5.8 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is trying to play catch up in technology IPOs. It last week ended a consultation for a proposed third board in 2018 that will house two markets - one for the start-ups and the other for mega dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, has opposed to the start-up market as he said these newly set up companies are too risky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung however urged the HKEX to launch the dual class shares market to attract the so-called unicorn technology companies with a market cap over US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many Chinese unicorn technology companies that like to list in Hong Kong. What we need to do is to prepare our markets to meet the needs of these companies," Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said if the HKEX would launch the third board for start-ups, he would consider listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More Chinese fintech firms vying to go public could choose Hong Kong as their listing venue, after the city's first fintech IPO received a hot response from investors, and that Hong Kong has unique advantages compared with other global financial hubs, said </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> 's head of global investment banking in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, closed nine per cent up from its IPO price on Thursday in its Hong Kong debut. With an oversubscription of nearly 400 times from retail investors, the company had priced its IPO at the top end of the expected range, raising US$1.5 billion in the city's biggest ever fintech offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and CMB International are joint sponsors of the deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Houston Huang, head of </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> 's global investment banking in China, expected the IPO to mark the beginning of more fintech companies seeking a listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A good fintech IPO will have a ‘push effect' on other Chinese fintech players, prompting them to consider linking with the capital market to raise fund," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The next Zhong An could show up in online payment, P2P lending, [financial] product distribution, or online insurance."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang expected China's fintech industry to expand fast in the next few years, due to the rapid spread of mobile technology and the application of artificial intelligence.A good fintech IPO will have a ‘push effect' on other Chinese fintech players, prompting them to consider linking with the capital market to raise fundHouston Huang, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology is driving revolutionary progress in China, " he said. "Fintech is an untapped market, with great growth potentials."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's fintech market could grow to 460 billion yuan (US$69 billion) in revenue by 2020, with a 44 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from 2016 to 2020, according to a recent research note from </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, revenue from online payment is estimated to increase to 202 billion yuan by 2020. Revenue from online distribution of financial products could grow to 52 billion yuan by then, while that for online lending and online insurance may reach 142 billion yuan and 60 billion yuan respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, companies seeking an IPO have to show profit in three consecutive years leading up to the application year, among other regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rules about profitability are less stringent in the US and Hong Kong, which gives the city advantages as described by Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also has other strengths, such as its proximity to the mainland market, the Stock Connect schemes that allow mainland investors to directly trade Hong Kong stocks, and comparably lower listing costs than the US, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Zhong An IPO may prompt structural changes in Hong Kong's capital market, which is trying to reduce its reliance on traditional sectors, such as real estate, financial services and energy, and increase the technology component.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given the strong response received for the Zhong An IPO, investors' knowledge and understanding about fintech had also grown, which could make it easier for future fintech companies to gain a reasonable valuation, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a bid to attract more technology and new-economy companies, the Hong Kong stock exchange has proposed a third board to allow listings by companies with dual-class share structures, which give certain shareholders more voting power than others.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, Ricky Chim Kim-lun and Gordon Tsui Luen-on will compete for 622 votes in a four-year term to represent Hong Kong's financial services industry in the Legislative Council. Eligible voters are stockbrokers, futures and gold traders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are all calling for reforms to change the Hong Kong market's dominance by financial services and property companies, to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are also calling for measures to reboot the broking industry, and help the smallest brokers survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A week before the September 4 election, the three candidates speak to the South China Morning Post about their thoughts on listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, 64, the incumbent lawmaker who's seeking re-election, said Hong Kong needs a new board with flexible listing rules to attract technology companies to raise funds here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), launched in 1999 to attract technology firms, was a failure," he said. "We need a new board with listing rules that are more relaxed than the main board and GEM."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its top spot as the world's largest IPO market in 2014 when Alibaba moved its record US$25 billion public offer to New York. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bars publicly traded companies with a dual shareholding structure, or shares that give shareholders unequal voting rights. That's compelled many technology companies to look instead to the US to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 22 of the 343 companies, or 6 per cent of the total, listed in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013 were technology related, Cheung said. Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If Hong Kong can find a way for dual-class structure that protects investors, I would support it," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government should work with Chinese regulators to let local brokers sign on new clients on the mainland, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a small market with a population of only 7 million," he said. "If Hong Kong brokers can go north to open accounts for clients on the mainland, it would be very helpful."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsui, 56, a former banker who joined the securities industry in 2000, is now managing director of Hantec Group International Finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like Cheung, he wants Hong Kong to implement a third board with a different set of listing rules to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs a new board with different regulations from the main board and the GEM to meet the needs of technology companies," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ricky Chim Kim Lun</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chim, 47, is a veteran of the financial industry of two decades, and a director of several listed companies. His seat was formerly held by his father Chim Pui-chung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should follow US regulations to attract a wide range of companies to list here, not just IT firms, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want companies in all industries and all sizes to list here to make it a diversified market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chim is also opposed to letting the SFC decide on what companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong does not need a new board," Chim said. "Hong Kong should adopt a disclosure based regulatory regime that allows companies to list as long as the disclosed information meets the SFC's standards. If the US can do it, so can Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if public companies offer shares with different voting rights, they should still be allowed to raise funds in Hong Kong, and it's up to investors to decide it they want to accept these unequal rights, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's broking industry is dominated by 14 of the so-called Category A brokers owned by large banks, now with 56.2 per cent share of daily transactions, up from 28 per cent in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle market, comprising 51 Category B brokers, keep a market share of about 33.4 per cent of trading every day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bottom of the market, with 435 small brokers in Category C, now make up 10.4 per cent of turnover, shrinking from 40 per cent market share from their heyday in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smallest brokers have been unfairly treated by the regulator and the government, Chim said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many government policies don't benefit the small players, and may gradually force them out of business," he said. "There should be more policies in place to help the small brokers compete with the big players."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Hong Kong's proposed listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All three candidates object to the listing reforms proposed in June by the HKEX and the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the proposal, two new committees will be established with equal number of representatives from the HKEX and the SFC to set policies for listing companies on the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's too much power in the hands of the SFC, according to all three candidates. The proposal would be of little help to increase the Hong Kong bourse's competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As many as 95 per cent of all the local brokers he'd met are all opposed to the proposed reforms, Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed listing reform would only complicate the listing process and lengthen the time for the approval, " he said. "It would not speed up the process. If the SFC insists on going ahead with the reform, it's going to kill off the market here and add further damage to the low market turnover."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia's booming technology landscape will become large enough for more than one stock exchange to cater for future initial public offerings (IPOs), according to the chief of Singapore's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector's explosion in the region has had leading regional and global exchanges vying for more tech listings, including Hong Kong, long seen as Singapore's arch rival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asian tech listings are in some ways, a new space,” said Loh Boon Chye, chief executive officer of the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yet no exchange has been able to establish a lead position. Being a new space means there is room enough for a few players; each can take its own track.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/17/183aa842-faa2-11e7-b2f7-03450b80c791_image_hires_205109.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX considers technology - which includes telcos and media firms - among its priority sectors, with 76 technology firms listed already in Singapore, with a combined market capitalisation of US$64 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of the month, South Korea's top mobile messenger operator Kakao Corp will list its global depositary receipts on the exchange, raising US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh claims Singapore's edge lies in its “strong technology eco-system”, pillared by a supportive government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore offers plenty of government initiatives and grants, led by the </span><span class="s3">National Research Foundation</span><span class="s1"> and official agencies, such as the </span><span class="s3">Media Development Authority</span><span class="s1"> and statutory boards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Startup Genome, the city state ranked 12th in the top 20 list of the world's start-up eco-systems in 2017, down two places from the previous year. Hong Kong wasn't even ranked, but Beijing and Shanghai are new entrants, at fourth and eighth respectively.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, heavy government backing can also work against entrepreneurship and commercialisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent survey of Singapore start-ups by the National University of Singapore's Entrepreneurship Centre found that while more than half of the tech firms survived past five years in business, they were still generating little growth or employment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 8.1 per cent of the 530 tech start-ups surveyed were considered “gazelles” - or high-growth firms that are increasing its revenue by 20 per cent annually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX, however, insists that government support is not its only edge over rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, it signed an agreement with the US's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> that will allow concurrent and sequential listings on both exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh calls that his “east-west corridor”, and that it's part of a wider strategy to draw more tech firms and start-up firms to list in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He dismissed, however, suggestions by the local media that Singapore simply provides a stepping stone to Asian firms who ultimately want to go public in the US, but have yet to qualify.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One can argue that it's easier to explain tech to investors outside the region, but you can also argue that you need to be able to explain Asia or Southeast Asia to investors from outside Asia,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The crux often lies in helping investors understand Asian business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Understanding how your model fits into distributing in Asia is equally important. You could then, because you are already Asian-focused, list on SGX first,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX is looking at prospects jointly with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, but Loh declined to give details or pin down a time when any debut listing might happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange's engagement with techs and start-ups has also spilled into taking private stakes in some promising prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX subsidiary </span><span class="s3">Asian Gateway Investments</span><span class="s1"> last October took a 10 per cent share in Capbridge, a Singapore-based capital-raising platform it helped create in 2015, with a S$1.5 million (US$1.13 million) grant over three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will help companies tap series B funding upwards, allowing them access lists of investors,” Loh said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange proposed revamping its listing rules last month to accommodate dual-class shareholding companies and biotech firms, without strong records of profitability, to avoid losing out on more IPOs by techs and new economy giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share firms must be worth at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) and have annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies with market caps of HK$10 billion or more that are already listed elsewhere will be eligible for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under their existing shareholding structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong gets set for a potential 600 billion yuan (HK$759 billion) asset management free-for-all on Wednesday when a mutual recognition scheme allows funds to be sold between the city and the mainland on equal terms for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Fung, executive director of Hang Seng Bank, said this cross-border initiative will help Hong Kong to develop as an Asian fund management hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"More mainland and foreign firms will set up shop or expand in Hong Kong as a result," Fung said. "This is not just adding fuel to the stock market. The mutual recognition scheme will also support commercial rentals and provide more job opportunities to young talent looking for a career in the fund industry," Fung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cross-border fund sales quota is even higher than the 550 billion yuan quota for the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which has been in operation since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-border schemes have played a major role in the stock rally. Beijing's April relaxation to allow mainland mutual funds invest in the Hong Kong market saw both Hong Kong and mainland stocks hit seven-year highs, with turnover surpassing all previous records.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another cross-border scheme is scheduled to link Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner at accounting firm EY, said these reforms will continue to benefit Hong Kong in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Connectivity to a bullish mainland market is generating energy in Hong Kong's markets," Pogson said. "Longer term, Hong Kong's challenge is to differentiate itself sufficiently from the mainland markets so as to remain the first choice for capital-raising and see to it that it does not lose out to the deeper liquidity sitting in the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong brokerage houses need to move nimbly and swiftly to address the new marketplace and ensure they stay alive and thrive."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx is planning to consult the market in the second half over a proposal to change the listing rules to allow companies with dual-share structures that give some shareholders more rights than others. However, last Thursday the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> publicly expressed its opposition to the current HKEx proposal. This has added uncertainty to the planned move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This comes after the city lost e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s listing to the US in September as the local exchange refused to accommodate Alibaba's request for dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe Hong Kong needs to catch up with listing reforms to tap the IPO potential of mainland tech firms that are delisting in the US and returning home to take advantage of the higher valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers say Hong Kong would not be the choice of these companies without the necessary listing reforms. But some fund managers have voiced opposition to dual-class shares on the grounds of investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1">'s Fung also said Beijing has carried out several banking-related reforms. The State Council last week approved a draft amendment that removed the 75 per cent loan-deposit ratio, giving banks more freedom to lend. Saturday's decision by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to cut reserve requirements for some banks is aimed at helping to further boost liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These reforms will lead to further integration of the onshore and offshore interest rate markets," Fung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of financial firm Reorient, said the biggest impact could come from the launch of the China International Payment System in October. "This signifies one of the biggest steps for the development of China by having the first international yuan settlement system," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a settlement system in place, he said the globalisation of yuan would be well within reach.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has set its sights on becoming a wealth management centre for rich mainlanders, and will also diversify its income sources and expand the profile of new company listings, according to HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an exclusive interview with the South China Morning Post, Chow said HKEX has been very successful over the past 20 years in promoting initial public offerings but he conceded that the bourse is not diversified enough.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past five years, mainland companies accounted for 90 per cent of the funds raised, while over the past decade only 3 per cent of funds were raised by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The challenge ahead for the HKEX, like other stock exchanges, is to attract new economy firms to list here," Chow said. The bourse operator last Friday issued a consultation paper proposing establishment of a new third board with flexible regulations to attract start-ups and larger tech companies with dual shareholder structures, such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">. The new board, if it receives support from the market, would be launched in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX and the government is trying all efforts to fight for all mega IPOs, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> which will be the biggest IPO worldwide next year," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is the HKEX chief throwing caution to the wind with his New Economy dalliances?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098931/hkex-chief-throwing-caution-wind-his-new-economy-dalliances]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said another challenge for HKEX was to diversity its business which is why it wanted to expand into commodities through the acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metals Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commodities represents 14 per cent of HKEX income now, up from nothing before the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> acquisition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Income from stocks represented 24 per cent of its total income in 2016, down from 56 per cent in 2000 when the HKEX was established through the merger of the stock and futures exchanges and their related clearing houses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has launched six metal products in Hong Kong and plans to add two gold contracts in July, while it is in the process of launching a commodities platform in Qianhai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is not easy to expand into the commodities market. However, since mainland China is the largest consumer of many commodities, the room for future growth in this area is huge. This will be a major development for the HKEX in future," Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX needs to diversify into commodities trading, clearing and other new business lines. Like any other commercial company, HKEX will be successful only if it can keep seeking out new business lines and new income," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual share class is a sore thumb in Hong Kong's new tech board[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098727/dual-share-class-sore-thumb-hong-kongs-new-tech-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opening up of China's capital market would remain the key to success for HKEX, which already has a solid track record as the preferred fund raising platform for Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the HK$3.269 trillion (US$420 billion) raised from new listings over the past 20 years, 78 per cent was from mainland firms, which showed the important role of Hong Kong as a fund raising centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow believes this role will continue under the New Silk Road initiative, in which China wants to work with 65 neighbouring countries to establish roads, railways, power plants and other infrastructure in coming years. The initiative is seen as boosting new listings and fund raising needs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another role for HKEX to play would be as a wealth management centre for mainlanders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is now the world's second largest economy and many mainlanders are getting wealthy and they have demands for investment. Hong Kong is a natural choice as we have the two stock connects to tie up with the bourses of Shanghai and Shenzhen... while the bond connect will develop this year," Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be more product launches at HKEX to fulfil the role as a wealth management centre for the mainlanders," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In reviewing the 20-year anniversary of the local bourse since the handover, Chow said HKEX "has come a long way and developed in a way that was better than expected".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total market capitalisation has risen eight-fold to HK$27 trillion now, up from HK$3 trillion in 1997, while average daily turnover stands at HK$82.1 billion compared with HK$15.5 billion at the handover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial sector now represents 18 per cent of Hong Kong's GDP, up from about 10.4 per cent 20 years ago.Since mainland China is the largest consumer of many commodities, the room for future growth in this area is hugeChow Chung-kong, HKEX chairman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also ranked as the world's No 1 IPO market from 2009 to 2011 as well as in 2015 and 2016, in terms of total funds raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow's only regret came in 2015 when the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the exchange proposal to launch a second consultation on dual class shares for Hong Kong. However, the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing supports the consultation launched last Friday because this time the proposal is for dual class shares structure firms traded on a new board, not trading on the market as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow added that it would be desirable if the government could play a more active role in helping the market find the right balance between market development and regulation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) is preparing to launch a second stage of consultation on weighted voting rights, in the third quarter of this year at the earliest, with an emphasis on higher governance standards for a small group of sizable listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The demand for a more stringent regulatory regime for companies wanting to use dual-share structures was bolstered by opposition to the proposal from a number of large international managers including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1">, BlackRock and </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">, who warned their introduction could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are considering proposing that, generally, 'one share-one vote' should prevail but that weighted voting rights structures should be allowed for certain companies in certain circumstances and with certain safeguards," David Graham, HKEx's chief regulatory officer and head of listing, said on Friday. "It is not our intention that such structures become commonplace in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he expected such structures would only be allowed for large, fast-growing, companies, and that one investor-protection proposal was to make compliance advisers permanent, rather than staying for a year when listing on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong, a director of brokerage KGI, said the investing public should be aware of the potential risks associated with companies that adopted a standard other than the "one share-one vote" principle since Hong Kong, unlike the US, did not allow class-action lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba dumped Hong Kong and opted for a New York listing last year, raising a record-breaking US$25 billion. The decision to list in the US was primarily due to Hong Kong's refusal to allow the company's request for dual-class shares and a partnership structure that would have allowed management to nominate a majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> said dual-class shareholding structures could reduce the alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders, a key "soft" protection in a low free-float market such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Gaud, senior portfolio manager at Edmond De Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters: "If Hong Kong is losing mandates to the US or in the future to Shanghai, it is good the situation is reviewed. But they would need to balance what they are giving away to the major shareholders, founders and promoters, by not forgetting about the minority shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx said institutional investors supportive of the proposal included </span><span class="s3">Norges Bank</span><span class="s1"> and CICC Hong Kong Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second-stage consultation will last for about three months.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies are knocking on the Hong Kong stock exchange's doors, making inquiries about raising capital under new listing rules, in a sign that the biggest overhaul of regulations by the bourse in three decades may be showing the desired effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 10 companies involved in e-commerce, online payments and biotechnology, mostly based in mainland China, have sought out information from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), according to the bourse operator's chairman Chow Chung Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies are asking for more information about our newly announced listing reforms, including the chance to list here under a dual-class shareholding structure,” Chow said in an interview with the South China Morning Post, without identifying any of them. “None of them have made a formal application, but they are interested to know more about our proposed rule changes.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flurry of interest, less than a fortnight after the HKEX unveiled its regulation change, appears to be a tentative, though preliminary, vindication of the push by the exchange to reinvent itself to compete with New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore for the global crown in initial public offerings (IPOs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will finish 2017 in third place in the global IPO stakes, with the funds raised falling 45 per cent to US$13.87 billion, the lowest since 2012, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York took the crown this year, with the capital raised more than doubling to US$29 billion, helped by blockbuster listings like the US$3.9 billion IPO by </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">, which operates the social media service Snapchat.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Part of the lure of New York is the allowance of multiple-class shares, or stocks with special voting rights for founders, to be listed. This practice, common among technology companies and start-ups from Baidu to </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, runs contrary to Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That obstacle prompted </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest e-commerce company and owner of the Post, to take its US$25 billion IPO to New York in 2014. For a large stock like Alibaba, nearly US$2.2 billion worth of shares changed hands everyday on average in the past year, almost a quarter of the total turnover of the entire Hong Kong exchange over the same period.</span></p>

HKEX, apart from being an exchange operator, is itself a listed company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial Services, and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi are all in the queue for IPOs. But the record breaker will probably be </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, with its US$100 billion IPO, based on a US$2 trillion valuation of the sovereign oil company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have tried our best effort to present Hong Kong as the best market for </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list,” Chow said. Chow and HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia were among the delegates with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor who visited Aramco's top officials two weeks ago, including energy minister Khalid Abdul Aziz al-Falih, as well as the kingdom's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter while China is the largest oil importer,” Chow said. “Hong Kong is the most international financial market in China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/28/ac90a180-ebc6-11e7-8d3e-3515408466a8_image_hires_201242.JPG]To avoid missing out on the technology boom, HKEX and the city's securities regulator announced on December 15 that they would allow large technology companies with multiple classes of shares, as well as biotechnology companies with no revenue, raise capital in the city under new regulations. Companies that are already listed elsewhere would also be welcomed to seek out a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of companies which made enquiries aimed at having a primary listing in Hong Kong, while a few want to check on information about a secondary listing,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even with a more relaxed set of listing regulations, the HKEX will maintain a proportionate degree of shareholders rights to protect minority investors. Snap, which gives its founder disproportionately more voting power than minority shareholders, would not qualify to list in Hong Kong, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to reclaim our No.1 spot, but we will never sacrifice our market's quality,” Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's initial public offering market continued to decline in the first quarter, as the total capital raising was down 26 per cent on year, sending the city down the rankings to the No 3 spot globally, behind New York and Frankfurt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s main board and the Growth Enterprise Market saw a combined</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">48 new listing raising more than US$3 billion, reflecting the worst first quarter in five years.The bulk of the funds, or US$2.8 billion, were raised by 25 companies on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a Hong Kong lawmakers for financial services sector, said the low IPO number in the first quarter was a result of the consultation of the listing reform at HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aberdeen Standard leads calls for more investor protection within HKEX's proposed listing reforms[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2136796/fund-managers-call-more-investor-protection-hkexs-proposed]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many listing hopefuls are holding up their listing plans in the first quarter. This is because the HKEX has released this listing reform consultation in February and the companies want to wait until the change of the listing rules before they apply for listing. After the rule change is settled in April, we will see more large IPOs,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung said Hong Kong is likely to face heated competition as mainland China also wants to introduce similar changes to attract overseas-listed companies to host Chinese depository receipts in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But Hong Kong could still compete as it is an international centre and has no capital controls. In comparison, China still has capital control and has not yet fully opened to western investors,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said last week that Hong Kong and the two mainland bourses were not direct competitors. The mainland tech giants can list as H share and A shares together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange has set a goal of overtaking New York's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology companies and their market capitalisation, according to HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The declining trend came after funds raised at IPO in Hong Kong in 2017 fell 45 per cent to US$13.87 billion, the lowest level since 2012, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lack of big tech-related stocks and other blockbuster capital raising are among the reasons Hong Kong lost its global IPO market crown - a title it retained in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, the city slid to the No 3 spot globally for IPOs, overtaken by New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last Friday marked the deadline for a market consultation on the proposed rule changes to allow large tech companies with dual-class shares structure and biotech firms that have yet to generate any revenue to list in the city, possibly as early as April. These dual class share structures are favoured by technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or Alphabet as they enable founders to maintain control of the company even though they only hold a minority of the listed shares</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/26/64f17ce4-3033-11e8-aca1-e0fd24c4b573_image_hires_092253.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are several unicorns such as Lufax and Xiaomi which are expected to list in Hong Kong after the listing reform. These could boost the city's competitiveness as a listing destination for new economy giants. This would also help Hong Kong to climb back to the top of the IPO market worldwide again,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 2.8 per cent of IPO funds raised in Hong Kong in the first quarter are from high technology firms, compared with real estate companies which represented 39 per cent, and financial companies at 30 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked No 1 with 16 companies raising US$10.35 billion in the first quarter, thanks to success in attracting listing among top tech firms and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, which is more focus on technology, ranked as the fourth largest IPO market while it may challenge Hong Kong for third place amid pending listings by big players such as Chinese Netflix iQiyi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which was not among the top IPO markets in 2017, ranked second in the first quarter as the </span><span class="s3">Instone Real Estate Group</span><span class="s1"> listing in February raised US$1.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai declined to fifth in the first quarter from third last year, while Shenzhen's small and medium sized market ranked sixth. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen are mulling rules change to attract technology firms to list which would post competition with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong relies heavily on Chinese companies in its IPO market. In the first quarter, Chinese companies represents 79 per cent of all fund raised. China's Bank of Gansu is the largest IPO in the three month period in Hong Kong, raising US$900.7 million (HK$7 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nasper, the majority shareholder in </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, last week sold shares in the company worth</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HK$76.94 billion, which is the largest deal in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This brought total equity capital markets activities in the first quarter to a record US$20.3 billion, up 150 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> ranked top of bankers in all types of equity capital market underwriting, capturing a 23 per cent market share with US$4.7 billion in related proceeds. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi rounded out the top three with a 16.4 per cent and 16.3 per cent market share, respectively.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prospects for a Hong Kong listing this year for Chinese internet giant Alibaba have dimmed dramatically in the wake of disclosures by investment bankers that the mainland's No1 e-commerce firm is wrestling with how to keep management control after shares are sold to the public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources say the desire of chairman Jack Ma Yun to keep clear control of the company he founded in 1999 throws into doubt the likelihood of a Hong Kong share sale given strict listing rules that forbid dual structures that separate voting and ownership rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">People close to Ma, who founded Alibaba in his hometown of Hangzhou, said the teacher-turned-entrepreneur had planned to move forward quickly with the listing of his </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, but that sentiment had changed in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment on its plan for an initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources say Ma has been planning an IPO of shares in </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> since August last year, when he de-listed the flagship trade portal </span><span class="s3">Alibaba.com</span><span class="s1"> from the Hong Kong stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that would not happen if he could not keep control of the company, investment banking sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking into account Ma's personal 7.4 per cent stake in Alibaba, the entire management team owns a combined 10.4 per cent stake in the firm. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> owns 36.7 per cent and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, 24 per cent, according to official information released by the two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The most viable solution for Ma to maintain control over Alibaba's board may be to establish a mutual agreement with the two biggest shareholders, </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and SoftBank, who would agree to appoint Ma or his designated person to manage the company on a daily basis," said Edward Au, a Deloitte partner specialising in China listings. An agreement between Alibaba and its major investors </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and SoftBank is, however, easier said than done.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, Alibaba and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> had a very public dispute over Chinese electronic payments processing firm Alipay. The two parties later reached an agreement that Alibaba would get paid at least US$2 billion but no more than US$6 billion if Alipay goes public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alipay provides payment processing services to </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and its affiliates, including Taobao, a popular consumer-to-consumer portal on the mainland and widely considered one of the jewels of the Alibaba portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's current listing rules do not allow a so-called "dual class" voting structure as the US market does. The US system allows the management of a company to retain control through shares that have more voting power than publicly traded shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the New York listing of Manchester United last year, the Glazer family, which has owned the English football club since 2005, sold 42 per cent of its Class A shares to public investors, who would get only 1.3 per cent in terms of voting rights. Under the terms of that sale, Class B shares have 10 times more voting power than the publicly traded shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Glazer family had once considered listing in Hong Kong or Singapore before it picked New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some bankers with working ties with Ma said the Hong Kong securities regulator and the city's stock exchange might review and revise its existing listing rules to attract listings of technology firms such as Alibaba in the event of the US market unwinding the dual-class voting structure to cope with rising demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firms like Alibaba are often run by a group of founding members who own minority stakes due to seed investments by other investors during the start-up period, requiring special provisions for control by founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Should China's largest e-commence company succeed in hitting a market capitalisation of US$100 billion, it would rank as the third-largest internet firm behind US search giant </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, with a market cap of US$290 billion, and online retailer </span><span class="s3">Amazon. com</span><span class="s1">, at US$133 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing of Alibaba could easily run up to US$15 billion, which would be the biggest capital raising in the city this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now that the dust has settled on whether the Hong Kong stock exchange should grant Alibaba a special waiver to list dual-class shares, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia is stirring up the issue again. He kicks off his latest blog with: "Now that Alibaba has gradually faded from media attention, maybe our market can finally have a more rational and open discussion about weighted voting rights and our future competitiveness." The implication here is that the previous discussion, which resulted in Alibaba deciding to list in the United States rather than in Hong Kong, was somehow irrational.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li takes issue with the "one share, one vote principle" which he seems to think has wrongly been seen as the Hong Kong market's "core value". This, he argues, is not universally applied and ironically takes the case of HKEx which, although a listed company, the government gets to elect six of the 12 board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, Li thinks that rule of law and due process are the market's core values. They dictate that "we must not change our rules haphazardly for a single company and any significant change would need to go through due process. But on the other hand, due process does not dictate refusal to debate the future of our market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You can see where he is going with this. He makes the point that dual listings are permitted in the US, saying, "It is difficult to conclude that US regulators chose to allow the dual-class share regimes because they do not care about investor protection. The success to date by firms like </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> makes it difficult for us to conclude that US investors have lost out as a result of such structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share, one vote, he says, has a nice ring to it and, "if we only care about reputation, this approach will certainly help to maintain Hong Kong's nominal regularity purity". The corollary of being overly concerned with what he calls "regulatory purity" and persisting with a ban on dual shares is that China's technology and new economy companies will list in the US rather than Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If this becomes a trend, Hong Kong could lose a huge franchise for good, " he says, getting to the meat of his argument. This of course hurts competitiveness, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So for all the chat about having a rational debate, Li's discourse does not take the discussion any further and is a restatement of the view that if Hong Kong sticks to one share, one vote - this will affect the Hong Kong market's "competitive" position and will result in the loss of new China listings to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One aspect of the discussion he neatly avoids is that in the US, investors can use the class action system to obtain legal redress. This is not available in Hong Kong where the cost of legal action is usually not worth it. This is a huge difference which Li does not address. There is also the question of whether Li or the HKEx is the right body to be initiating this discussion. It has a huge vested interest in this matter, and as such is deeply conflicted. It's not unlike having a rabbit in charge of the lettuce patch. This topic shows no sign of going away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In harm's way</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jim Walker's Asianomics has come out with a cheery report that says Hong Kong's current positive economic demeanour is masking the tell-tale signs of a sharp and possibly unprecedented correction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is in the path of a typhoon developing on the mainland," Sharmila Whelan, an analyst with Asianomics, told The Telegraph. "A nasty downturn in China and a sudden sharp correction in the Hong Kong property market would severely buffet the territory's economy. China's problems have become insurmountable and the likelihood that 2014 will prove the year of reckoning is growing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The problem lies in the banking system, according to the report. Before the financial crisis, China had never represented more than 10 per cent of total external claims. Post-crisis, there has been a dramatic shift, with Hong Kong financial institutions' exposure to the mainland rising to 49 per cent. Much of this is from the offshore units of big mainland banks, which have been using the city as a base for sourcing foreign funding that is re-lent in the domestic economy. A real estate crisis on the mainland would have a serious impact on Hong Kong bank balance sheets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government supports plans by the city's stock exchange to launch a new platform to attract technology and new economy companies to list, according to a minister.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Attracting high quality companies to list in Hong Kong is important to the future development of the Hong Kong capital market,” Chan Ka Keung, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We support the stock exchange in its plans to review local listing rules and to launch a new platform to attract more technology or new economy companies. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will work together to study these issues,” Chan told media after he hosted the opening ceremony at the exchange to mark the first trading day of Year of the Rooster.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last month the local bourse would this year conduct a consultation to launch a third board, with more relaxed regulations than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, to attract technology and new economy companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is the world's largest initial public offering market worldwide based on total funds raised in the past two years. However, the listings are heavily biased towards financial firms, which accounted for 69 per cent of funds raised last year, while tech firms accounted for only 3 per cent, according to a report by consulting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compromise is likely outcome of Hong Kong listing reform as opposing camps stand firm</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said at Wednesday's exchange ceremony that the SFC would jointly work with the HKEX to study the project. In 2015 the commission rejected the exchange's proposal to allow dual class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong on the grounds that such structures did not offer sufficient shareholder protection. Many new economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> use dual class structures which allow a class of shareholders, usually the founders, to have more rights than other shareholders. The US allows such structures but Hong Kong has banned them since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will support the exchange to reform the market to attract more new listings while at same time we want to make sure market quality would be maintained,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would also enforce regulations for the GEM market which has seen the share prices of many new listings rise or drop substantially soon after listing. The SFC and HKEX last month jointly issued guidelines that required listing sponsors to make sure their GEM offerings were done appropriately in order to avoid such volatility. Some brokers said the new guidelines didn't go far enough and urged the regulators to increase the number of minimum shareholders of GEM companies from 100 to 300, matching requirement of the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Turf war between Hong Kong regulators escalates as HKEX director opposes listing reform</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will review the GEM rules in a consultation paper. We will be open-minded to market comments. However, it should be noted that even if we raised the bar from 100 to 300 for the minimum shareholders of GEM offerings, some people may still find a way to circumvent the rule. The SFC will continue to enforce the regulation to ensure the market quality,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the controversial listing reform has received several thousand comments and the SFC and stock exchange are reviewing the comments before making a conclusion. Last June the SFC and HKEX launched a market consultation on proposals to change listing approval procedures to give the SFC a more front line role in setting listing policies and approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals drew opposition from some listed companies and brokers who worried about giving too much power to the SFC but government officials and a former SFC head supported the reform, believing it would enhance market transparency and efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments are not a simple ‘yes' or ‘no'. While some support the changes, some are totally opposed to it. Some have different views on different proposals in the paper. We are working on them now and it will take time. The SFC still believes the reform will enhance market transparency and efficiency,” Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange will face mounting competition from Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, as speedier listing approval process and strong demand from investors expected next year will help them to extend their top rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its annual IPO review and outlook for 2018, EY laid out the prediction based on the number of IPOs and proceeds raised this year - 436 companies mopped up 230.4 billion yuan (US$35.1 billion) from the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These represent an increase of 92 per cent in number and 53 per cent in proceeds compared to 2016, and make the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges the top two respectively in number of IPOs completed this year. Hong Kong was ranked third, with a total of 160 IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in terms of proceeds raised, the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked top in 2017, with US$39.5 billion, followed by Shanghai at US$20.9 billion; and Hong Kong at US$16.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the number of A-share IPOs reached a record high, a lack of IPO that raised over 5 billion yuan per deal also means that all these IPOs' proceeds raised combined was just 47 per cent the total amount raised in 2010, which was the second biggest year for IPOs in numbers at 347.There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listedRingo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, “there were 508 companies [as of December 22] waiting in the pipeline to have their IPOs approved by the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">,” said Ringo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY. “There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said the A-share IPO market became more “normalised” as 2017 progressed, with an average of 30-40 IPOs completed per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, a record 160 IPOs were completed, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Combined they raised HK$128.2 billion (US$16.5 billion), down however by 34 per cent from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to EY, a lack of large IPOs also squeezed total funds raised in Hong Kong. But more significantly, a record 80 companies got listed on GEM board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bullish performance of the Hang Seng Index, which has gained 34 per cent this year and ranked first among major indices including </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Dow Jones Industrial Average, has benefited the IPO market, Choi said, adding that 28 overseas companies were also attracted to list in Hong Kong, the highest in six years, raising a total of HK$10.02 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“New listing rules to be introduced in 2018 for allowing listing of dual-class share structure on the main board; and the proposal to increase the minimum expected market capitalisation of main board applicants to HK$500 million from HK$200 million are all positive for the Hong Kong IPO market for the first half,” Choi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, for the second half he was more cautious. Apart from uncertainty about whether investors would still continue to favour equities like they did in 2017, Choi noted competition from the two exchanges in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expected that as A-share IPO vetting process accelerates with simpler approval procedures, this might erode the attraction of the Hong Kong bourse as these companies might opt for a listing on the mainland because of the attractive pricing levels that can be achieved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For 2018, he expects IPOs in Hong Kong to raise HK$150 billion, but a mega IPO, such as that by listing hopeful Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco, will bring the total to over HK$200 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Alibaba drums up its initial public offering in the US, there will be increasing expressions of regret about Hong Kong giving up the big cake in return for upholding its "one share, one vote" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is indeed big. Despite a slowdown in its growth, the e-commerce giant's valuation is still estimated at US$200 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some are gritting their teeth, the big question to ask is what would Hong Kong have had to sacrifice to keep Alibaba's IPO here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Judging from the corporate structure detailed in its filing made to the US regulators, the sacrifice would have been too big to bear.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a governance structure that will not only give Jack Ma Yun and the 26 Alibaba partners control over the board but also one that has zero chance of changing unless their stake drops below 5 per cent. The partners can kick Ma and chief executive Joe Tsai out of the partnership … the reality is, however, more complicated</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To Ma, it means being able to cash in 40 per cent of his 8.9 per cent holding if needed without compromising his control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is how it's structured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's article of association states that the Alibaba Partnership, which holds 13.9 per cent, will nominate a simple majority of directors for shareholders to vote on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will be a sure win because both SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> - holding 34.4 per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively - have agreed to vote along the same lines as the partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course there is a good chance that SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> will eventually sell down. Their relationship with Ma has been far from cordial ever since 2011 when Ma pocketed Alipay - a payment service processor - from Alibaba behind their backs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Ma has no need to worry. In case of a change in control of the company and the new shareholders rejecting directors nominated by the partnership, the partners will simply install some interim directors until the next annual shareholders' meeting. So on and so forth. This arrangement will not be changed unless 95 per cent of the shareholders agree to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is not about control by Ma, Alibaba said, rather to preserve the culture shaped by the founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in the hands of a few founders, the company said this approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be fair, Ma is not dominating, at least on paper. Various hurdles are put in place to give the partnership arrangement a rule-by-majority look.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the partners decide their director nominations by a simple majority vote. It even specifies that the partners can kick Ma and chief executive Joe Tsai out of the partnership with a simple majority vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reality is, however, more complicated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A partnership committee, comprising Ma, Tsai and three executives, decides three important things. One, who qualifies as partners. Two, who is to be nominated as director. Three, it makes recommendations to independent directors on each executive partner's share of cash rewards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While no one will be stupid enough to go against him, Ma and the incumbent committee members can seek re-election for an unspecified time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the way, Ma and Tsai have also been exempted from retiring from the partnership, even when they are no longer employees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given his firm control, it is therefore not surprising that Ma sees no need to get a first right of refusal from SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> in any future sell down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba conceded that "this governance structure and contractual arrangement will limit shareholders' ability to influence corporate matters, including any matters determined at the board level".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faith is the key. No wonder Alibaba compares its partners to "evangelists" in preaching its "mission, vision and values, both within our organisation and externally to customers, business partners and other participants in our ecosystem".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is perhaps why Alibaba has been able to provide scant details on certain crucial matters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is the mystery over who owns the remaining 20 per cent of Alibaba and whether they are selling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2012, Alibaba announced the issue of new shares to some investors. Among them were the country's sovereign wealth fund and Boyu Investment, a private equity firm set up by the grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin. No specifics have ever been given.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then, there is the uncertainty over how exactly Ma is going to ensure the company's interest in various related-party transactions with him. Among them is Alipay, which provides payment services to Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a written commitment, Ma said he "intends" to reduce his economic interest in Alipay over time to a percentage that does not exceed his ownership in Alibaba. He also promised that he would make no economic gain from that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just how reassuring is this expression of intent?</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Barrister Laurence Li Lu-jen is the front runner to head Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council, according to two people familiar with the situation, succeeding Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who recently became first woman to head the stock market operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143577/laura-cha-checks-hong-kong-exchanges-first-woman-chief-its-127]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143577/laura-cha-checks-hong-kong-exchanges-first-woman-chief-its-127]The FSDC was set up by Hong Kong's former chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, as an advisory body to conduct research into improving the competitiveness of the city's financial market and promoting it in international financial circles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, 47 and a finance and banking specialist, had joined Cha to help establish the FSDC in 2013 and is currently the convenor of its research committee. He has also worked at the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), the market regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Li was the one who helped Cha to set up the council. He is the most suitable candidate for the post,” one of the sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to comment on any appointment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whoever would become the chairman of FSDC, he or she would need to promote fintech and innovation in Hong Kong. The FSDC would also need to propose more measures to enhance investor protection,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li had led an FSDC report in 2014 on how to improve the IPO system, including a call for Hong Kong to follow London to launch different boards for different companies to attract innovative companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FSDC proposes specialised listing boards in wake of Alibaba IPO loss[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1535838/fsdc-proposes-specialised-listing-boards-wake]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report came in the wake of a decision by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to list in New York instead of Hong Kong, sparking debate in the city over its rigid listing rules. That debate ultimately led to HKEX unveiling the largest listing reform in 25 years in April, which among other measures allowed dual-class shareholding companies like Alibaba to list, as well as biotech firms that have yet to record any revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said it would be good if a new FSDC chairman focused on investor protection and fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform of the HKEX has successfully attracted large technology firms such as [Chinese mobile phone giant] Xiaomi to come here to list. The next major focus would be on investor protection - there are still corporate governance problems in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The FSDC and other regulators should make more proposals to clean up the market to attract investors to trade here,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li spent six years at the SFC between 1999 and 2005, while Cha was the regulator's vice-chairman. Before joining the SFC, Li practised US corporate tax law at the New York head office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li is also a member of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Urban Renewal Authority</span><span class="s1"> and a member of the Social Welfare Advisory Committee. He also serves as a judge on the Regulatory Tribunal of the Qatar Financial Centre.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next stop after the stock "through train" scheme could be commodities as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> looks towards tie-ups with mainland futures exchanges after the proposed collaboration with the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We'll need to focus on working out the details in establishing our link with the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in the next few months. In future, it would be possible for us to have more tie-ups with other mainland exchanges. We are not ruling out similar linkages with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> or futures exchanges across the border," HKEx chairman Chow Chung-kong said after the annual general meeting of the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and mainland regulators last week announced a through-train scheme to begin in October that will allow investors from the city and the mainland to cross-trade stocks listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong up to a quota of 550 billion yuan (HK$691 billion). The quota has no time frame and Beijing has not said if it will replenish the quota after it runs out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx and the Shanghai exchange will soon sign the agreement. Under it, mainland investors looking to trade Hong Kong stocks can do so through mainland brokers, who will place the orders at the Shanghai exchange that will then be passed on to the HKEx. Those in Hong Kong investing in mainland stocks will do the reverse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors can trade up to 10.5 billion yuan of Hong Kong stocks a day, or 250 billion yuan in total, while Hong Kong investors can trade up to 13 billion yuan of Shanghai stocks a day, up to 300 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the HKEx annual general meeting yesterday, some small shareholders asked about the possibility of listing reforms after the exchange lost e-commerce giant Alibaba's initial public offering to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to look for another listing venue after it failed to convince the Securities and Futures Commission and the exchange in October to allow it to list with a share structure that would give its founders and the top management more control of the board despite holding minorities stakes. The US allows such dual-class share structures but Hong Kong does not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's listing committee is studying the issue while HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wrote in his blog about the need to take a fresh look at the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But institutional investors are opposed to any changes in existing rules. A survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association on Tuesday showed most are against any changes to the listing rules and want the one-share-one-vote principle to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before we make any changes to our rules, we would need to have a consultation to gauge the market view," Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates the third largest stock market in Asia, on Wednesday reported better-than-expected net profit of HK$7.4 billion (US$950 million) for 2017, up 28 per cent year on year, on the back of higher market turnover and record number of new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This beat the consensus forecast of a 27 per cent profit growth to HK$7.34 billion, according to a </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> poll of analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results also marked the second best year ever, behind the HK$7.96 billion earned in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earning per share stood at HK$6.03, up 27 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said it would pay a final dividend of HK$2.85 per share, bringing the full-year dividend to HK$5.4, up 27 per cent from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's shares fell 1.31 per cent to close the morning session at HK$286 before the results announcement during the lunch break.The bourse operator's shares have risen almost 49 per cent in the past 12 months, making it the 10th best performer on the Hang Seng Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fourth-quarter profit stood at HK$1.87 billion, up 51 per cent than a year, according to calculations by the Post, which also beat analysts' forecast of HK$1.85 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In Hong Kong, we witnessed a bullish securities market especially in the fourth quarter of 2017 when the average daily turnover reached HK$107.3 billion,” HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong said in the results statement. Chow will step down in April after serving in the post for six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher stock market turnover helped deliver a 38 per cent annual increase in trading fee income at HK$1.95 billion. The average daily turnover last year stoodat HK$88.2 billion, up 32 per cent from HK$66.9 billion in 2016, but still below the HK$105.6 billion in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April 2015, China allowed mutual funds to invest in Hong Kong stock market via the stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai, which has boosted turnover up to an average HK$200 billion per day. Turnover, however, went down after the mainland markets' slump in mid 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It rose again in 2017 as mainland investors increased their investment in Hong Kong equities after the launch of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The northbound and southbound trading through the two stock connect grew significantly last year, increasing by 194 per cent and 170 per cent respectively from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their investment now represents almost 10 per cent of the daily turnover, which helped to drive the Hang Seng Index up 36 per cent last year, making it the world's best performing benchmark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fees, a major source of income, rose 8 per cent last year to HK$828 million, as a record 174 companies launched IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, since there were no blockbuster floats, the total funds raised dropped 34 per cent to HK$128.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow, however, warned on risks ahead, as stock markets worldwide have seen intense volatility in the first two months of this year, adding that impending US interest rate increases and US tax reforms pose challenges to global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The world is also moving into a new era of new economy businesses and technology innovations, and the financial markets are facing a landscape filled with both opportunities and challenges,” Chow said, adding the exchange is in the midst of listing reforms to capture these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange last Friday announced that it would bring forward listing reforms from June to late April, and would start accepting listing applications from biotech companies without revenue or giant new-economy companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, which has led analysts from Citi and CICC to view the developments positively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will meet the media and analysts later on Wednesday afternoon to provide an update on the exchange's development plans.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Riding on 3.8 per cent growth last year, Chan's forecast growth this year isas high as 4 per cent, with headline inflation kept at bay at 2.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The massive surplus - almost 8.5 times the amount projected in the last budget[http://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-budget-2017-2018] - also broke the 2007-08 record of HK$123.7 billion to become the biggest since the 1997 handover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This also increased fiscal reserves to an estimated HK$1.092 trillion by end-March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In delivering the budget, Chan, unlike his predecessor, took pains to show he was aligned with his boss' thinking, as he explained her “new fiscal philosophy” of optimising the surplus to invest in the future and relieve people's needs. “I agree entirely with her view,” he told the Legislative Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial secretary said he aimed to develop Hong Kong into a more diversified economy and highlighted innovation and technology as a major new growth driver that the city could not afford to lag behind in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The unstoppable wave of innovation and technology has swept through the world, fundamentally changing the global economic structure and the way we live and consume,” Chan said, as he presented an extra HK$50 billion in funding to boost IT development, on top of the HK$10 billion already reserved in last year's budget.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the new money, some HK$20 billion will be used on the development of the planned Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park in the border area of the Lok Ma Chau Loop. Some HK$10 billion will be injected into the Innovation and Technology Fund to support the establishment of research centres for health care technologies, artificial intelligence and robotics technologies, according to Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also proposed allocating HK$10 billion to Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks for it to boost research infrastructure and support for incubatees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In all these initiatives, Chan made clear the close link between the city's economy and that of the mainland. Noting that China now contributed more than 30 per cent to the global economy, he said the mainland's strategies have not only a global bearing but “are also the linchpin of Hong Kong's sustained prosperity”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To attract leading overseas and mainland internet enterprises and fintech companies to set up offices and research units in Hong Kong, Chan proposed HK$200 million in funding to Cyberport to enhance its support for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in a move to reform the stock exchange, he said that dual class share listings will be in place in the second quarter this year, potentially paving the way for listings by tech and biotech start-ups eager to be anchored in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To take advantage of the mainland's growing economy, Chan asked the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to set up an academy of finance to train the city's talent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the domestic front, while Chan did not heed the public's calls for handouts, the measures he rolled out came up to 40 per cent of the surplus. They include a salaries tax rebate of up to 75 per cent, with a cap of HK$30,000, widening the tax bands, a 20 per cent rise in tax allowances for families with children, as well as rates waivers of up to HK$2,500 a quarter, and extra social security payments to the needy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in line with his boss's fiscal philosophy, Chan departed from the past “small government” policy of keeping public spending at not more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product. Instead, he aimed to push the level to “slightly higher than 21 per cent” of GDP in the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 20 per cent cap was meant to avoid overexpansion of the government, but Chan argued: “Today, while acknowledging the forces and roles of the market, we have to be more proactive in managing public finances in the face of various development needs of society and the economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked later at a TV forum why he rejected calls for distributing cash to the people, Chan said he liked the relief measures to be aimed more specifically at the lower-income class.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan was made financial secretary early last year after his predecessor John Tsang Chun-wah[http://www.scmp.com/topics/john-tsang] quit the post to join the chief executive race, despite Beijing's apparent preference for Lam. Chan, who delivered his maiden budget last February, was picked by Lam to be finance chief in her administration, though it was widely reported he was not her first choice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The budget Chan delivered last year was mainly based on a nearly finalised draft prepared by Tsang. Wednesday's was widely seen as the first blueprint of his as well as Lam's philosophy on public financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his speech, a more confident-looking Chan, compared to last year, said his budget strategies also aimed to take care of the long-term needs of society and enhance health care and social welfare services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On health care, Chan noted the government had increased its recurrent expenditure by an average of 7 per cent over the past decade. Spending on public health care services will increase by 13.3 per cent to HK$71.2 billion in 2018-19, accounting for 17.5 per cent of total recurrent expenditure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An additional recurrent funding of nearly HK$6 billion will be allocated to the Hospital Authority in 2018-19 to increase the number of beds, operating theatre sessions and manpower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The limit on Elderly Health Care Vouchers will also be raised by HK$1,000 to HK$5,000 in 2018, which will involve expenditure of about HK$796 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also proposed to establish a HK$500 million fund to promote the development of Chinese medicine by providing support in areas such as applied research and knowledge exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To support the second 10-year hospital development plan, HK$300 billion would be set aside as an initial provision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The finance chief also set aside HK$20 billion for the improvement and development of cultural facilities, and another HK$500 million for the acquisition of museum collections and holding exhibitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On education, Chan also planned to increase recurrent expenditure by another HK$2 billion, on top of the HK$5 billion that Lam already pledged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the extra spending will be aimed at achieving quality education, through enhancing the professional development of teachers, strengthening support for kindergartens, and supporting schools in enhancing the promotion of life-wide learning, or education in real-life settings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan proposed to allocate some HK$504 million to launch a three-year pilot scheme to provide social work services in phases for about 150,000 children and their families in all aided childcare centres, kindergartens and kindergarten-cum-childcare centres.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also promised more resources from the 2018-19 school year to achieve “one social worker for each school”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There will also be a one-off grant of HK$2,000 to each student in need to support learning, involving an expenditure of about HK$740 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Largely following the footsteps of his predecessor, Chan offered a number of one-off “sweeteners” to ease the burdens of taxpayers and the needy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to higher tax allowances for children and dependent parents and grandparents, there will also be tax rebates of 75 per cent for salaries taxpayers, with the cap being lifted by 50 per cent from last year to HK$30,000. That is expected to benefit some 1.88 million taxpayers and see tax revenue reduced by HK$22.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For landlords, property rates will be waived for four quarters of 2018-19, subject to a ceiling of HK$2,500 per quarter for each property. That is estimated to benefit 3.25 million properties and reduce government revenue by HK$17.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And there will be two extra months' pay to recipients of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance or Disability Allowance. That will involve an additional expenditure of about HK$7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government will also set aside HK$15 billion for arrangements for offsetting severance payments or long service payments against Mandatory Provident Fund contributions - almost doubling the HK$7.9 billion proposed previously by Lam's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying[http://www.scmp.com/topics/leung-chun-ying-0]. Details of the new mechanism are expected to be released soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese Manufacturers' Association welcomed the budget measures but said the HK$15 billion the government set aside for the MPF offsetting mechanism was “still some distance away” from what the business sector had expected. It urged the government to increase its financial commitment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his speech, Chan noted that the property boom had resulted in land premiums increasing by HK$62.6 billion to HK$163.6 billion, or 62 per cent higher than estimated, but he did not touch much on cooling the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He only urged caution, saying the “key factors underpinning soaring property prices over the past few years are gradually undergoing fundamental changes”, citing the increased supply and possible US rate hikes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The private sector will, on average, produce about 20,800 residential units annually in the coming five years [from 2018 to 2022], an increase of 50 per cent over the annual average in the past five years,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides, as at end-December 2017, the projected supply from the first-hand private residential property market in the next three to four years will remain at a high level of about 97,000 units.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides, as the US interest rate normalisation process continues, the ultra-low interest rate environment of the past few years will no longer persist.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sharmaine Lau Yuen-yuen, chief economic analyst at mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services, expressed disappointment that Chan had not come up with measures to cool the market or help people own homes. She urged the government to ease the loan-to-value ratio to 90 per cent for flats priced up to HK$8 million to help first-time buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, possibly to help Lam honour her promise that there would be “surprises” in the budget, put forward some unexpected measures, including giving out 10,000 free tickets to primary and secondary students to Ocean Park, and HK$2 billion to expedite installation of lifts in schools, and HK$100 million for the promotion of e-sport.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung criticised Chan for failing to roll out any plans to address the income gap problem. “One-off relief measures cannot solve any deep-rooted social problems,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenny Shui Chi-wai, senior researcher at the policy think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation, welcomed the government's move to inject resources into innovation and technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Shui said the government should also increase funding for university research so as to “consolidate the world-class status of local universities and continue to train local talents”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stands out as the preferred market for raising capital among China's most valuable companies, according to a survey that vindicates last year's overhaul in the city's stock listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four out of every 10 so-called unicorns[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2110209/who-has-most-unicorns-china-or-us] identified Hong Kong as the preferred market for an initial public offering (IPO), according to a </span><span class="s3">PricewaterhouseCooper</span><span class="s1"> survey of 101 of these companies, each with at least US$1 billion in valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US stock markets come in second at 25 per cent, followed by China's yuan-denominated A-share market in third place with 23 per cent, according to the survey of C-suite executives including founders and chairmen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is the preferred capital market partly due to the latest tweaks in its listing measures, including the support for biotechnology companies and dual-class structures, reflecting the determination to embrace the new economy by the stock exchange,” said Gao Jianbin, PwC's leader for China technology, media and telecommunications leader, in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey is the latest vindication for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which last year pushed through a controversial overhaul of the city's listing regulations along with the securities regulator. The amendments, the most extensive in three decades, were to help the bourse regain its pole position as the world's largest market for fundraising, after losing the 2017 crown to New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expanded listing reforms in progress, says HKEX chairman[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139938/expanded-listing-reforms-progress-says-hkex-chairman]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes have paid off, as the exchange awaits the US$6.1 billion listing next week by Xiaomi the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, the world's fourth-most valuable technology start-up at US$60 billion, is also filing to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/25/e5f72856-783c-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_image_hires_142712.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flurry of new listings this year will help Hong Kong claw its way back to the top three spots in global IPO rankings, from the fifth rank during the first half, PWC's rival Deloitte said earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's overseas-listed tech giants in top talks for trading homecoming[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2135572/chinas-overseas-listed-tech-giants-top-talks-trading]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To compete, China's securities regulator has shown that it can fast track IPO applicants in a matter of days, instead of the typical two-year wait. The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">is also rolling out a class of Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) to allow domestic investors to partake in the offshore listings of Chinese companies, opening up an additional avenue to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, some unicorns will wait and see the results of real listings before making the decision to jump into the CDR fray, Gao said. Xiaomi, which was supposed to be the pioneer for the CDR programme, last week postponed its CDR plan, marking a setback for the Chinese government's overtures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Questions remain as countdown begins on depositary receipts with Chinese characteristics[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2151293/questions-remain-countdown-begins-depositary-receipts-chinese]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also enjoys the advantage of being an established capital market and global financial centre, complete with transparent and predictable procedures and rule of law, Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey found that 64 per cent of the companies have a listing plan in the next two years and 21 per cent called it an urgent task. About 75 per cent of the respondents have been running business for less than eight years while the remaining ones have been in operation within four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the survey, unicorn companies listed talents drainage and disruption on capital chain as the two biggest potential challenges or crisis they are concerned about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is itself a publicly listed company, its stock rising by almost 19 per cent in the past 12 months.</span></p>
