<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's largest investment fund managers urged the Hong Kong stock exchange operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), to introduce more safeguards for protecting minority investors' interests when the bourse allows multiple class shareholding technology companies to list from June, in a seminar on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many fund managers who are also members of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> have opposed allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong as this is in breach of the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKIFA still believes that ‘one share, one vote' is best for investors. But with the listing reform a done deal, we will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list here,” said Sally Wong, the association's chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding companies are favoured by technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, as they allow founders and certain shareholders to retain more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies seeking to list dual-class shares may get green light to apply for Hong Kong listing by end June[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2128434/companies-seeking-list-dual-class-shares-may-get-green]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in 2014 as Hong Kong has banned dual-class shareholding companies from listing since the mid-1980s while the United States allows it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But after a lengthy debate, the Hong Kong government and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> now support the HKEX's listing reform plan allowing such companies to list, as the city wants to attract technology companies and compete with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, said on Tuesday the exchange will next month have a consultation on rule changes, including what investor protection measures should be introduced before dual-class shareholding companies can list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX has proposed that not all companies can be listed in such structures, and that it will allow only the very big technology companies to list with weighted voting rights. This will be conducted in a restricted fashion,” said Jonathan Lowe, the managing director of JPMorgan Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But I think some more additional safeguard measures will be needed.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronnie Lim Fook-yan, senior engagement specialist at Robeco Asia-Pacific, said the exchange should require dual-class shareholding companies to adopt equal voting rights for all types of shareholders in the situation of voting independent shareholders, so as to ensure these directors can represent minority shareholders' interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ‘one share, one vote' principle should also be adopted in approving related party transactions, he said. “There should be a clear disclosure about the special shareholding structure in the IPO prospectus. It is also important to educate investors to understand about their rights and risks in investing in these companies,” he said.We will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list hereSally Wong, chief executive, Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christine Chow Sheung-yi, the associate director of Hermes Investment Management, said all shareholders should be given the right to vote at the annual general shareholder meeting to decide if the dual-class shareholding structure should continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said a key reason for allowing such a structure is to allow founders to keep their corporate vision for the long term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, dual-class shareholding structures should not be a default but the founders and management have to work hard to earn them. It should allow all shareholders to judge if they have carried out the corporate vision well enough to achieve the benefit of the company, and to translate the founders' vision to become the corporate vision,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HSI Services, which compiles the Hang Seng Index, this week started a two-month consultation on whether dual-class shareholding companies should be included in the benchmark index, as passive investments will need to buy into these stocks if they are constituent stocks of the index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s Lowe said unless there was an extreme case, such as Snap, which allows its founders to have all voting rights while other shareholders have none, he believes other dual-class shareholding companies with reasonable governance could be included in the index.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) busies itself consulting on detailed trading rule changes, to pave the likely way for companies seeking dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, it's time to outline exactly what their inclusion in the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index would mean.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a proposal by HKEX, a one-month consultation period ends on March 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its plan is to attract three categories of new-economy companies to list here: large biotech companies without revenue, giant dual-class shareholding structured new economies companies, and US-listed mainland new-economy companies looking for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting right over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are popular among many tech firms such as US tech firm </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, and pointedly mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns South China Morning Post. The fact Hong Kong could not then offer Alibaba a dual-class structure was seen as a strong reason why the tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With several “unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion) expected to seek public funding in the not-too-distant future, such as Xiaomi, WeLab, Lufax, and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">, officials in Hong Kong are anxious not to have a repeat of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX expects to start accepting dual-class applications, soon after the end of the consultation's conclusion in late April, with the first dual-class share companies floating in the city as early as June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we still don't know whether or when successful dual-listed companies will eventually be allowed to be included in the benchmark Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's important, as many passive fund managers track the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index. If such companies were be added to these indexes, they could be accessed by a much larger pool of institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there are the Stock Connect share trading links between the Hong Kong exchange and its peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen to consider, which only allow the trading of stocks listed on the major Hang Seng Indexes (again, the Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index) to qualify, and in which mainlanders and mainland mutual funds have readily invested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong exchange's turnover comes via southbound trading over the Stock Connect links.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So if these stocks are not allowed to be included in the major indexes, mainlanders would unable to buy them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Indexes Company, which compiles the benchmark indices, completed its own public consultation on the issue, ending On February 28 - but it's still yet to publish its conclusions nearly a fortnight on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants themselves, say they still have mixed views on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers, supports the inclusion of dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index, giving a green light to mainlanders to plough into them via Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many passive fund managers, however, oppose the suggestion, as once dual-class shares are included in the leading Hang Seng indexes, they fear they would have no choice but to focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other fund managers express reservations on the dual-class structure as it violate the city's “one-share, one vote” rule - an important principle for listed companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, New York's S&amp;P and London's FTSE indexed have not included these companies in some of their indexes, as in some cases they add restrictions on calculating their weighting on a gauge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSCI, another major index complier, is also consulting the market on their inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland exchanges consider allowing them, we are going to see more of these companies listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any blanket ban on them appearing in major indexes would be unlikely - but we are likely to see some restrictions coming with such issuances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many sector the adage that “uncertainty breeds opportunity” rings true, but not in this case. Markets hate it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so it's now doubly important the Hang Seng Indexes Company and other compilers announce their final decision on dual-class shares, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange operator has scrapped a planned consultation to expand listing reforms that would allow corporate investors to own stakes in companies that have a so-called dual-class shares structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision is a further setback for the sweeping reforms, which have so far failed to generate the much hoped-for slew of applications from big technology firms eager to raise capital on the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange introduced new rules in April to allow companies with dual-class shareholding rights, or weighted voting rights, to list here. The reform allows individual founders or certain key executives of these companies to own shares that carry more voting rights than those of other shareholders. The move was aimed at attracting more technology companies, which tend to favour this structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) had said initially it would launch a separate consultation by July 31 on whether it should also allow companies to own the special voting-class shares. The bourse, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that this consultation would not be launched after all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said: “Given that the current weighted voting-rights regime has only recently been put in place, the exchange believes it should deliberate further the extended weighted voting-rights regime and should continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to develop a broader consensus on the subject matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the exchange has decided not to launch a corporate weighted voting-rights consultation at this time as initially planned. The exchange will update the market on the subject in due course.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief expects more IPOs under Hong Kong's new listing regime after summer break[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2146645/hkex-chief-expects-more-ipos-under-hong-kongs-new-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marks another setback for the biggest overhaul of the local bourse's listing rules in 25 years, which was carried out amid high hopes that it would attract technology giants with dual-class shares as well as biotech firms that are yet to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Almost three months on, only two companies with the dual-class shareholding structure - smartphone maker Xiaomi and online food-delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> - have applied for listing. Hangzhou-based </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in mainland China, is the only pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing, and is set to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is somewhat disappointing,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector. “We would like to see the HKEX continue its listing reform to accept diversified companies to list, including those with different shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it may be a good move to slow down the pace to allow more parties to discuss further on the reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiaomi's recent IPO not living up to its expectations of raising US$10 billion and some Chinese tech firms opting to float their shares in the US and Shanghai, Hong Kong could only maintain its No 3 global IPO ranking in the first half, unchanged from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong retail investors give Xiaomi's IPO the cold shoulder, put off by high financing cost and valuation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced earlier this month they would not allow dual-class shareholding companies listed in Hong Kong to be traded by mainlanders via the stock connect schemes, a further blow to the effectiveness of the listing reforms. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiao-jia flew to Beijing last week to negotiate, and the three bourses agreed to look at when dual-class companies might be allowed to trade via the stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, supported the HKEX decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The dual-class shareholding listing reform was only launched three months ago. The market participants and investors still need time to digest the reform. It would be too soon to launch another consultation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX would be better off focusing on working with the mainland regulators to sort out the issue of mainlanders being able to trade the dual-class shares via the stock connect. That would be more important than making further changes to the listing reform.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is Hong Kong's rival, and not Shanghai or Shenzhen, when it comes to attracting “unicorns”, according to Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Asian stock exchanges are vying with each other to change listing rules in a bid to attract new economy companies and dual-class shareholding structure firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen have never been competitors of Hong Kong as we always cooperate with each other. Tong said on the sidelines of a regulatory forum on Wednesday. “Rather, Singapore is a competitor of Hong Kong,” adding that if dual-class shareholding companies were to list in Hong Kong and in the mainland, it would be a win-win situation for both.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong cooperates with mainland stock markets but we are very independent,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, owner of theSouth China Morning Post, chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structure allows shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian stock exchanges previously opposed such companies to list because it goes against the “one share one vote” principle. But now several exchanges are speeding up their reforms to explicitly allow dual-class shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of SFC, said at the same forum that the commission found shortcomings in the works of 31 financial firms that acted as listing sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some listing sponsors did not fulfil their duty with regards to due diligence on the companies they sponsored, falling short of the SFC requirements,” she said, adding the commission will issue a report on the matter soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also said the commission plans to study some brokers' demand to use WhatApp to take customer orders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Singapore maintained their high ranks in a report on corporate governance published on Wednesday, but a decision to allow listings by dual-class shareholding companies has eroded their edge over other jurisdictions in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report was presented by brokerage CLSA and non-profit organisation Asia Corporate Governance Association. The association ranked Hong Kong second in the region, with a score of 60 in its biennial survey, followed by 59 for Singapore in third position. CLSA, on the other hand, ranked Singapore second with 70.1 points, Japan third with 66.7 points and Hong Kong fourth with 66.3 points. Australia topped the rankings in both cases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2016, the non-profit ranked Singapore second and Hong Kong third, while CLSA ranked the Lion City third and the special administrative region fourth, behind Japan and Australia in second and first places, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threat to that fundamental driver [of better corporate governance],” the association and CLSA said in their joint report. While a belief "in the value of transparency and accountability remains largely intact, the third principle, fairness, has come under fire”, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shareholders with dual-class shares have different voting rights. Through this structure - popular among emerging companies and industries - founding shareholders or key management with minority ownership can still retain control over company board directors and major decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has allowed companies with dual-class shares to list since April this year; Singapore followed in June, in the face of competition from exchanges in the United States that have long allowed such listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only two mainland China companies with dual-class shareholding structures have listed in Hong Kong so far: Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone supplier; and food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Yonts, head of environment, social and governance and power research at CLSA, a joint sponsor of Xiaomi's US$4.72 billion initial public offering this year, said its analysts had "marked down” Xiaomi on "fairness” when giving it a score, which was "in line” with the average score given to mainland Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asia Corporate Governance Association, said Hong Kong and Singapore's lead over other Asian markets would have been three to four points higher, had they not allowed dual-class share listings.The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threatCLSA, Asia Corporate Governance Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he believed the two cities would be able to maintain their edge, as there was no sign yet that lower ranked but close rivals Malaysia and Taiwan would follow suit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the problem in Malaysia is, if they start losing some of their technology companies to Singapore, Hong Kong or the US, then clearly there will be pressure on them. It really depends on what happens in the next six to 12 months, in terms of where some of their companies choose to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said he was worried that a "contagion” had already started, and gave the example of South Korea signalling this year an interest in allowing small businesses and venture start-ups to issue dual-class shares, to encourage more small technology companies to list on the Kosdaq second board market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was ranked by the association on the basis of "original and independent research”, with no input from outside respondents to 121 questions it designed to assess a country's corporate governance. The questions cover government policies, regulatory rules and enforcement, investors' participation in corporate governance and corporate audit standards, besides society and media monitoring. The association also incorporated findings from an in-depth look at disclosure and governance practices of 25 large and mid-capitalisation stocks in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, meanwhile, used a "bottom-up” approach by examining 1,100 listed companies' governance in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said Hong Kong's move to set up an independent regulator for the audit industry next year is positive, but bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> had not gone far enough in its recent corporate governance code revamp, on issues including gender diversity and limits on the number of corporate boards individual directors are allowed to sit on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, the trial of so-called mixed ownership in state companies - private and state capital - had yielded mixed results, said Allen. The reform would fare better on the governance front if private funds were allowed to invest in units spun off from state-owned enterprises, and appoint representatives in their independent new boards, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have had a number of pre-IPO enquiries relating to the new listing regime,” said an HKEX spokeswoman.“We expect potential issuers and their consultants will file formal applications in due course.The listing regime is a standing facility and potential issuers don't need to rush to file applications on the first day.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following a reform announced last Tuesday, after many rounds of consultations held over four years, the HKEX now allows technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology companies with no revenue to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are still a lot of challenges to implementing this reform. Obviously, we are facing a lot of competition from other markets for listings by technology companies,” Laura Cha Shih May-lung, the newly elected chairwoman of HKEX, said on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides the United States, where many big mainland China technology companies are listed, Singapore is also changing its listing rules to attract flotations by technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is up for another round of market reform as the stock exchange will solicit views from the public at the end of the month for a new board to allow more technology firms like Alipay and Lufax, as well as foreign giant companies such as </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchange is at the final stage of preparation in the details of this new board. We hope to have the consultation about launching this new board by the end of May,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which runs the stock and futures exchanges in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the sideline of the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> Week Asia forum on Wednesday, Li said they were keen to have a bigger variety of companies to list here, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO that is expected to raise US$100 billion, in a 5 per cent stake sale of the oil giant valued at US$2 trillion. Hong Kong is in the running for the listing, but is facing competition from London and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new market which brokers call the third board, will be the third market in Hong Kong after the Main Board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said in January that the new board would have different listing rules from the other two markets to allow more foreign firms, infrastructure firms, overseas companies on the “Belt and Road Initiative”, technology or new-economy companies, and firms that want to be listed in a dual-class shareholding structure, to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX rekindles plans for dual-class share structure in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2063569/hkex-rekindles-plans-dual-class-share-structure-city]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be a good idea for the HKEX to launch a new board to attract more technology firms to list. Hong Kong has many big banks and financial giants to list, but we have too few technology companies listings here,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector, and is himself a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firms. This would be better than changing the rules for the main board and the GEM,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung however, said the consultation needed to also offer suggestions to safeguard the interests of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We also want the HKEX to have good communication with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, for the regulator to support the reform. We do not want to repeat the chaos two years ago when the stock exchange proposed rule change on dual shareholding structure, and the plan was rejected by the SFC immediately,” he said.A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firmsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many new-economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares with a dual-share structure as their founders tend to hold on to a minority stake but want to retain control. Dual-share structures allow certain shareholders to have more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York over Hong Kong in 2014, as the SFC considers its shareholding structure to be a dual-class shareholding that is banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US. Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called Hong Kong listing rules outdated, that they do not meet the needs of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pain of Alibaba loss prompts HKEX to examine new measures[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2012339/pain-alibaba-loss-prompts-hkex-examine-new-measures]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - payment arm of a unit of Alibaba - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> are both considering to list to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the plan a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time would be different as the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing last month said the commission had agreed to a consultation on the third board, including the dual-class share proposal. The change in attitude was because the type of listings would be limited to the new board, while the previous proposal applied to the entire market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, HKEX would face an uphill battle to convince all stakeholders to accept the dual-class shareholding structure. Many fund mangers such as </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> and Templeton Franklin are opposed to it as they consider the structure unfair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be good to have a new market in Hong Kong to attract different types of companies to list here. But as usual, devil is in the details. We need to see if the HKEX proposals are flexible enough to attract new technology companies to list here, while at the same time, that there is sufficient investor protection,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Stockbrokers Association chairman Benny Mau said if the HKEX would propose a third board, it would need to clearly define how the role and listing requirements are different from those for the main board and the GEM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The consultation paper should also consult the market if all investors could invest in this new board or if it should be for institutional investors to trade only,” Mau said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will find it hard to attract secondary listings by mainland technology companies such as e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which are already listed in the United States, because of competition from China, Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Beijing's plan to introduce China depository receipts will be a big threat to Hong Kong. When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong Kong,” Leung said during a forum of the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will led to more new economy companies that have not yet listed to opt for listing in the US instead of Hong Kong, as they will think they can issue China depository receipts at a later stage.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is known as the “father of red chips”. As a well-known investment banker in the 1990s, he brought many red chips - companies with a mainland parent incorporated overseas - to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Those listed in the US already have exposure to international investors. The reason for them to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong is to capture mainland investors who trade these stocks via the stock connects. If China were to invite these companies to issue China depository receipts on the mainland, there is no point in them having a secondary listing here,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the China depository receipt requirements are very high, and only the very large companies will be invited by authorities to issue these in China. As such, companies that do not qualify will still like to list in Hong Kong after the listing reform,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung added that mainland companies too wanted to list in Hong Kong, because they wanted to capture international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that faced with such competition, the Hong Kong stock exchange would need to be more proactive in its fight for such companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the local bourse operator, announced its biggest reform in 25 years on Tuesday. It will from Monday allow dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotechnology companies with no revenue to apply for listings here. Dual-class shareholding companies allow founders, or key management of the companies, to hold a premium class of shares that has higher voting rights than normal shareholders, a structure favoured by many technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Leung said the reform had not gone far enough. He said it was not right for the HKEX to require that premium class shareholders have the same voting rights as ordinary shareholders when they elect independent non-executive directors, or change articles of association.When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong KongFrancis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of allowing dual-class shareholding structure companies to list here is to allow the founders and key management to keep control over major issues even though they hold minority stakes. Waiving their special rights to appoint independent directors to the board will not reduce their influence on the board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX introduced this requirement to meet a demand by fund managers for added protection for investors. Leung, however, said the bourse operator should achieve balance to make sure founders and management have control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the HKEX should expand the reform to allow companies, instead of just individuals, to hold these premium class shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government has signalled that it intends to drop a plan to establish a new board on the city's stock exchange for start-ups and companies with multiple-class shareholding structures to raise capital, choosing instead to amend existing rules to allow these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is likely reach a consensus with the Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SEC) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) in the next few weeks, and publish a conclusion of the public consultations that have taken place over the proposed new board, said James Lau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have looked at both possibilities” of whether to introduce so-called weighted voting rights, or multiple-class structure, on the proposed board or the main board, Lau said. “The chance is higher on the main board.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The unexpected comment is the first sign that the Hong Kong government, years after agonising over how best to retain and attract so-called new economy companies to raise capital in Asia's largest destination for initial public offers, is now preparing to step away from the plan. What changed was the successful IPO last month by Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$1.5 billion on the city's stock exchange, even as its profit track record didn't meet the main board's requirement of a combined profit of HK$50 million in the three years before listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read: HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's market ranked third among global destinations for IPOs in the first three quarters of this year, with 106 companies raising a combined HK$85 billion in the city, according to Deloitte's data. That compares with the whole of last year, when 71 IPOs raised HK$134.3 billion (US$17.2 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's brokers, bankers and regulators had been divided over how best to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> -- the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post -- abandon the local bourse to stage its record US$25 billion IPO in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue was a voting structure among the company's founding shareholders that gave them veto power over the appointment of directors, a special right that contravenes Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle. Ever since, Hong Kong had been debating whether to allow companies with dual-class shares, a common feature among technology companies from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> to Snapchat, to list on the exchange, or establish a new board to cater for them. The New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> bourses allow these dual-class stocks to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/2aca847a-b7ed-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_image_hires_203112.JPG]In June, HKEX proposed to set up a new board, or so-called “Third Board”, as part of its broader market reform. The new board will permit dual-class shares, a structure designed to give specific shareholders more voting power than others. Shares in one class carry one vote, while shares in another carry multiple votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over these past few years, we have all observed a better trend in the development of this particular sector and do have a better grasp of the future direction,” Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said today during a taxation forum. “So under different sets of circumstances now, if we can have a proper safeguard design and have them put in place, allowing companies with weighted corporate structures to be listed is not impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move has been regarded as part of the exchange's efforts to woo more technology and emerging companies amid growing competition for initial public offerings among global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal's public consultations ended last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, media reports said HKEX plans to highlight four points in the conclusion of public consultations, which could pave the way for a potential next round of consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four points include supporting the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, making rule changes to the main board instead of setting up a new board, scrapping the establishment of a new listing segment targeting tech start-ups, and adding new rules to attract emerging companies such as biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, the HKEX proposed to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing reforms, due to kick-start later this month, are likely to attract more technology firms to list on its stock exchange - but only as long as the authorities can provide appropriate investor protection measures, the head of leading global fund manager Janus Henderson Investors has cautioned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, is now in a race with counterparts in mainland China, Singapore and the US to compete for new technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what's expected to be the largest listings shake-up in Hong Kong for three decades, dual-class shareholdings are likely to be included for tech and biotech companies without strict requirements on revenues and profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities commission backs introduction of dual-class shares on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124972/securities-commission-backs-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a structure will allow one class of shareholders to own more voting right than others, an arrangement favoured by many founders keen to maintain control while still holding minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move comes after more than two years of consultation, and remains controversial, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While HKEX and many tech firms want to change the rules to allow them to list here, many fund houses oppose the change as they would violate the city's long-held “one share, one vote” principle, and may hurt the interest of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major UK investor Aberdeen Standard Investments, for instance, does not favour these kinds of company listings, due to corporate governance concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1">, the fund industry's controlling body in the city, has also called on HKEX to require dual class shareholding companies to appoint more independent board directors, to safeguard the interests of fund companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Andrew Formica, Janus Henderson's co-chief executive, has now come out and said his company would invest in these companies, but only with the caveat they have good corporate governance standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will the introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong boost Chinese tech shares listed in US?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2131905/will-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong-kong-boost-chinese-tech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[Investing in] technology companies is a fast growing market in the US and Europe,” Formica said in an interview with South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What's important is that HKEX and the regulators introduce measures to protect the interests of [all] investors, who are [taking a share] in these tech companies.”What's important is that HKEX and the regulators introduce measures to protect the interests of [all] investors, who are [taking a share] in these tech companiesAndrew Formica, Janus Henderson Investors' co-chief executive</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said his fund house had invested in some US-based dual class shareholding companies now listed, and would again in future, only “if the managements can show they are adopting good corporate governance standards for small shareholders”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Janus Henderson was created by the merger of </span><span class="s3">Janus Capital Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Henderson Global Investors</span><span class="s1"> in May last year, which expanded its footprint with managers investing across stocks, bonds and other alternative assets classes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Headquartered in London and dual-listed itself in New York and Australia, Janus Henderson has US$344.9 billion worth of assets under management, more than 2,000 employees and offices in 27 cities worldwide.Its Asia-Pacific assets under management had risen to US$58 billion by the end of last year, and it has 200 staff in Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney and Melbourne.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Formica said after the merger, it has more resources to develop its new technology investment portfolio, and certainly aims to expand further in Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asia has a huge population and fast economic growth,” he said. “There are a lot of customers who have growing demand for investment services in the region.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures that list on the Hong Kong bourse under its new listing rules will join the Hang Seng Composite Index so that they can be traded by mainland Chinese and international investors through the Stock Connect schemes, the index compiler, Hang Seng Indexes Company, said on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first such company is likely to be Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which filed for a listing in Hong Kong last week that could be the world's biggest flotation since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion debut in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such companies would not join the benchmark Hang Seng Index for now, the compiler said, meaning passive fund investors that track the Hang Seng Index would not be able to trade in them as they only buy companies in the benchmark index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision, which comes just after the bourse operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), unveiled reforms to allow companies with dual-shareholding structures to list on the exchange for the first time, will be subject to a review at an unspecified time in the future, according to the index compiler.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform aims to attract more technology firms to list, but we also need to achieve a balance of market concerns … there are fund mangers who have expressed concern that they would be forced to buy into these stocks if they are included in the benchmark,” said Vincent Kwan, director and general manager of Hang Seng Indexes Company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We would need to wait for more companies with dual shareholding structures to list here and monitor their trading patterns before we can decide on what conditions we should impose for them to be qualify to be included in Hang Seng Index,” Kwan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huge number of Chinese tech unicorns likely to IPO in Hong Kong in 2018, says JPMorgan Asia-Pacific chief[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144880/huge-number-chinese-tech-unicorns-likely-ipo-hong-kong-2018-says]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting rights over other shareholders.Such structures are popular among tech firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, but the Hong Kong bourse's previous refusal to allow such structures had seen it lose out as a choice of IPO destination.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some local fund managers have expressed concern that companies with such structures do not follow the one-share one-vote principle that previously defined Hong Kong's listing rules. This has led some of them, particularly passive fund managers that track the major indices, to urge the index compiler not to add these firms into the Hang Seng Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index covers the top 50 largest blue chips, while Hang Seng Composite Index has 483 constituent stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is good to see dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index so as to allow mainland Chinese to invest via the Stock Connect schemes,” saidChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers. The Stock Connect schemes link the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, allowing both onshore and offshore investors to trade in all three markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he urged the index compiler to consider quickly including such firms in the Hang Seng Index, as they are taking important roles in the local economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Excluding them would mean less fund managers would invest in them and hence the liquidity of stock trading would be affected, as would the competitiveness of Hong Kong in trying to attract these companies to list here,” Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another pillar of the listing reform was to allow biotechnology firms that have yet to generate any revenue to list in Hong Kong, an effort to capture part of a growing industry. However the compiler will not consider including such firms in any major index for now, Kwan said, after some investors raised concerns over risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These biotech companies are new to Hong Kong investors. We need time to study their trading patterns before including them in major indices,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One week after the launch of the new listing rules, only Xiaomi has submitted an application, in contrast to market expectations of about a dozen firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, the former Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has joined online lender WeLab as a senior adviser, the second top minister to join the budding fintech sector in as many months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining WeLab is Chan's first major private sector commitment since he left the government in July last year after serving in the post for 10 years. He has since returned to academics as an adjunct professor of finance with the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 61, has taken a path similar to former financial secretary, John Tsang Chun-wah, who was defeated last year in his bid to become the city's chief executive, and in June joined fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific as vice-chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan declined to reveal his salary for his role in WeLab, which he took up on July 6 but was only made public on July 16.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said this was not a full-time job and that he could advise other fintech companies as well while continuing to teach at the university. At WeLab he will only help with setting out strategy and will not be involved in the day to day operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I taught at the university in the first part of my career. Then I joined the government for 10 years as a minister. Now I think it is right time for me to open a new chapter in my career in fintech,”Chan said WeLab's office in Sheung Wan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I always promoted fintech when I was in the government. During the past 12 months at the university, my focus has also been on financial technology and start-ups. By joining WeLab, it gives me a chance to put academic theory about financial technology into use,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's decision to join WeLab has a lot to do with his faith in co-founder Simon Loong.The home-grown unicorn - which has a valuation of US$1 billion - will be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), Loong told the Post in an exclusive interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority is now accepting application from new players to set up virtual banks which purely offer services online without any physical branches.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The online lender last week filed an application to list on the main board of Hong Kong stock exchange.Brokers speculate it may raise US$500 million, although the company has not made any comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a start-up which uses big data and other new technology to approve and handle loan approval. It is full of young staff below 30 years old. I like to work with young colleagues to try something new,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said fintech development in Hong Kong has taken huge strides since the HKMA brought in a range of measures last September to promote banks to use new technology to cut costs and enhance their services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chan was in government, e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014 opted for listing in New York instead of Hong Kong as the city at the time did not accept dual-class shareholding companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April implemented massive listing reforms to attract dual-class shareholding companies and biotech tech firms without revenue to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We did all want Alibaba to list here but our regulations would not let that happen. There was no regret as we had to follow the regulations at the time. We do hope after the listing reform of HKEX, we can now attract many of the unicorns to list in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's successful listing marks the beginning of an era for multiple class shareholding companies to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, said it was a positive move for a former minister to join the fintech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fintech is a hot topic in town and has a lot of room for development,” Cheung said. “It will be good to have these experienced government officials join the fintech industry as this will help forge closer ties between the public and private sector and promote Hong Kong as a smart city.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is on track to lose its much-coveted crown as the world's top initial public offering (IPO) market as the year draws to a close, with latest figures showing total funds raised here have dropped 48 per cent compared with 12 months ago, leaving the city ranked third behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPO funding raised by 67 companies on the main board of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) this year stood at US$12.29 billion as of Wednesday, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">, compared with US$23.72 billion at the same stage of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York's 67 IPOs raised US$28.93 billion and Shanghai saw 197 companies raise US$18.69 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The disappointing Hong Kong result comes even after a recent flurry of new listings in the past two months - but even those failed to turn the tide in its favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has been the top IPO market for the past two years, but a lack of real blockbuster new listings and its failure especially to attract tech firms, have been blamed for getting kicked it off its perch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan has already announced a consultation paper will be launched by HKEX in the first quarter of next year on plans to examine allowing dual class stock listings - a type favoured by many technology or new economy companies - which it hopes will help reverse its fortunes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/06/cdf36ba2-da44-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_161237.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual class stock is the issuing of normally two types of shares by a single company, possibly offering more voting rights or dividend per share than other classes of shareholdings. That is the type favoured by tech giants </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share class might be offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives or family. The class offered to the general public has limited voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides them majority control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is allowed in the US, but has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the world's largest IPO this year raised US$3.91 billion, adopted a dual class shareholding structure for its offering in New York. Its stock exchange had three IPO among the top 10 in the year-to-date, including two hi-tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market, in contrast, is still dominated by "old economy" financial firms, seven of which make up its top 10 largest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> was Hong Kong's largest IPO this year raising HK$16.5 billion (US$2.22 billion), which was also the only domestic listing to squeeze into the global top 10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other more-recent heavyweight HK floats have come from China's largest online car retailer </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (US$866), gaming device maker Razer (US$524m), China Literature (US$1.06b), China's largest online publishing and e-book site, a unit of Tencent, and ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance (US$1.52b), China's first online-only insurer backed by Alibaba affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> .[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs to fight for both old and new economy companies to list here," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for financial services sector who is also a broker, "so as such, we should allow companies with dual class shareholding structure to be listed".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we would need to add in a number of measures to safeguard the interest of investors," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested, for instance, having sunset clauses - regulations that can automatically be abolishing - and possible expiry dates on adopting such a structure. One sunset clause might be the company would have the option to delist, if the founder or key management members were to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norm Champ, a partner at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, and the former director of investment management at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it would be "smart" for</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong to change its listing regime to allow dual class share structures, given the fierce IPO market worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SEC and the </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> are also very keen on getting more companies to list in New York by easing the disclosure regulations," said Champ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the actual number of listed companies in the US has fallen by half over the past two decades as many companies stayed private, or delisted, to escape the expense and scrutiny of being public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SEC may also relax some regulations such as the disclosure of the pay ratio of the chief executive to other employees, Champ said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The IPO market has bounced back in the US this year, and that trend is likely to continue."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has failed to secure a spot in the top 10 league table for funds raised from IPOs of technology companies worldwide, which surged three times to US$18.87 billion in the first eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong's main board only ranked at the world's 12th largest market in terms of IPO funds raised by technology companies, while the second board Growth Enterprise Market ranked 19th.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This marks a contrast to the ranking for the world's largest IPO market, where Hong Kong's main board is placed fourth as its strength lies in drawing financial firms to list, but not technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Hong Kong has seen improvement this year. So far, three technology firm IPOs have raised a combined US$424.1 million this year, which is 30 times higher than the same period last year when one firm raised US$14.8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increase is largely attributed to the IPO of FIT Hon Teng, a subsidiary of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and maker of connectors for Apple's iPhones that raised US$393.58 million in June. It was also the world's eighth largest technology firm IPO this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/24/39ca4cb6-88c3-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_image_hires_205050.jpg]Despite the improvement, funds raised from technology firm IPOs on the main board only accounted for 2.3 per cent of global technology firm IPOs. The volume is substantially lower than the New York Stock Exchange, the top technology IPO centre, where four technology firm IPOs to date have raised US$4.56 billion, accounting for 24.2 per cent of global funds raised, the Thomson Reuters data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Swiss Stock Exchange ranked second and South Korean ranked third, while Shenzhen ChiNext ranked fourth, and Singapore was fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other markets,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the city's financial services sector.Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other marketsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has been a worldwide trend that there are more and more new economy and technology companies seeking for listings. They are the future driving force of the worldwide economy. If our market could not capture these companies to list, we would lag behind,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has just completed a consultation to set up a third board to attract more technology companies to list, but it would still need a second round of consultation for the detailed rules. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wants the new board to be launched in the first half of 2018, but he will have to convince all stakeholders to accept the proposals that have received very mixed reactions during the two-month consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have different regulations from the existing main board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has proposed the third board to have two markets: a premium market for companies eligible to list on the main board but with dual-class shareholding structures and open to all investors, and a second market for start-ups and open only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong currently bans dual class shares which are allowed in the US. Dual class shareholding allows founders or key management of the companies to own shares with more voting rights than the others, which large technology firms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> preferred.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the largest technology IPO this year which raised US$3.9 billion on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in March, also has a dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, Francis Leung Pak-to on Monday showed support for a new market for dual class share companies with a market cap of HK$8 billion (US$1 billion) to list, but opposed to a start-up board market as he said the risks of failures of these newly set up companies were too high.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong beat New York for the first time in 18 months to reclaim the crown as the No 1 market worldwide for IPOs in the first nine months of this year, as the listing reform led to a slew of companies raising funds in the city, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This also marked the first time Hong Kong has risen to the top of global IPO rankings since it fell to fourth place in the first quarter of 2017 behind New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the quarterly data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eighty-four companies raised US$28.6 billion through IPOs on </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s main board in the first nine months of the year until Wednesday, up 220 per cent from the US$8.93 billion raised a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York, the top IPO market worldwide since the first quarter of 2017, dropped to second place as 48 companies raised US$25.1 billion during the first nine months. </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> ranked third at US$18 billion while Shanghai took fourth place at US$10.44 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The driving force behind the HKEX's IPO boom was the listing reform in April, which attracted three big technology blockbusters from July to September. About 42 per cent of IPO funds raised so far were by telecommunications firms, hi-tech firms accounted for 5 per cent, retail 19 per cent, financial 13 per cent, real estate 7 per cent and others accounted for the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A year earlier 61 per cent of the funds were raised by financial firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest global IPO so far this year was telecom tower operator China Tower's US$6.9 billion fundraising in August, the biggest since </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$7.6 billion Hong Kong listing in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse, which implemented its biggest listing reform in 25 years in April, allowing companies with dual shareholding structures, new economy as well as the biotech firms without profit or revenue to list here, attracted two mega dual-class shareholding structure companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smartphone maker Xiaomi launched its US$5.4 billion Hong Kong IPO in July and China's food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised US$4.2 billion this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class shareholding companies allow founders and key management to own shares with more voting rights than other shareholders which is favoured by many technology and new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city was the No 1 IPO market worldwide from 2009 to 2011 as well as in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with main board and GEM, funds raised by 144 IPOs in Hong Kong stood at US$29.1 billion in the first nine months, up 208 per cent from a year earlier. It was also the highest amount raised in a decade, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific, said IPOs in Hong Kong will continue to grow but warned of difficulties ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many companies have been rushing through with their IPOs in recent months. The real reason behind the strong IPO market may be that the listing hopefuls have a bearish outlook.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that many IPOs in recent months could only fix their offer price at the low end and some have seen their shares drop below the offer price on debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark indexes of both Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges this year have dropped more than 20 per cent from their peak and briefly entered bear markets, as the ongoing US-China trade war has hurt investment sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, however, is more positive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It expects the strong IPO momentum in Hong Kong to continue in the coming months as the listing reform gives many tech and biotech companies more flexibility, said Edward Au, co-head of Deloitte China's national public offering group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deloitte estimates a total of 220 new companies, including 10 unicorns, to launch their IPOs this year, up 33 per cent from last year. These companies are expected to raise about HK$300 billion (US$38.41 billion), up 134 per cent from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is likely to remain at the top of the PO ranking for the rest of this year,” Au said, but he cautioned that the ongoing US-China trade war is dampening overall investment sentiment in Hong Kong and this could make investors think twice whether to buy biotech firms that are yet to register revenue or profit.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange reclaimed its crown as the No 1 IPO market in the world in 2018, beating last year's winner New York, as listing reforms led to the highest fundraising in eight years, according to Refinitiv data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main board had a 17.6 per cent share of the global IPO market this year as of December 21, with 125 companies raising US$36.5 billion. This was the highest since 2010 and up 175.5 per cent from last year, according to the data provider formerly known as </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on the other hand saw 64 IPOs raising US$28.9 billion, accounting for 13.9 per cent of the global IPO market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong was the No 1 IPO market in 2015 and 2016, the city mainly attracted traditional manufacturing firms and financial companies, with few tech companies listing here as they preferred New York and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In terms of TMT (telecommunications, media and technology) listings, Hong Kong came second after Tokyo in its highest ranking ever in this category.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest reforms in 25 years allowing dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list proved to be a major driving force in boosting tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class or weighted voting rights shareholding companies allow founders and key management greater say than other shareholders. These are favoured by many technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> and others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms launched by the bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April attracted two dual-class shareholding companies: the world's fourth largest smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in its July listing, and food delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> with its US$4.9 billion IPO in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobile tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion IPO - the largest IPO in Hong Kong this year - was also tech related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overall TMT IPOs raised US$15.7 billion, up 605.5 per cent from 2017 while the number grew 94.4 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tokyo's rise to third place in the IPO league table this year was also due to its ability to draw tech plays with US$24.5 billion in proceeds. This was mainly due to Softbank mobile unit's US$23.3 billion jumbo IPO this month - Japan's largest ever IPO and the world's second largest after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion fundraising in New York in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Japanese conglomerate owns stakes in e-commerce giant Alibaba and ride-sharing companies Uber and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, among others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Telecommunications and hi-tech were the two biggest fundraising sectors in Hong Kong this year, representing 39 per cent of funds raised, compared to 10 per cent in 2017. The financial sector, traditionally the largest sector in Hong Kong, this year represented just 9.5 per cent of all fundraising, compared to 32 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised from Hong Kong's equity capital markets - share placements, rights issues and IPOs - stood at US$64.2 billion in 2018, up 80 per cent year on year. It was also the highest after US$91.7 billion raised in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The listing reform has attracted many big players to list in Hong Kong but it was at the expense of lowering our corporate governance standards,” said Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner of </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1">. "The HKEX will need to introduce more measures to enhance investor protection.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said Hong Kong's IPO market will face pressure from Shanghai when it launches its new tech board in 2019, as China's financial capital will be competing for the same group of unicorns as Hong Kong and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accounting and consulting firm </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> said that it expects IPOs to decline by HK$100 billion (US$12.7 billion) next year amid market uncertainties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at global law firm Dechert, said that unless issues surrounding the global markets - the US-China trade war, Brexit and political unrest in certain parts of Europe - are resolved, Hong Kong will see a noticeable slowdown in IPO activity next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New economy companies seeking to list dual-class shares in Hong Kong could be eligible to apply by the end of June, according to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-stock-exchange] (HKEx) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a listing reform plan announced last month, HKEx will allow biotech firms without revenue and other large new economy companies with dual-class shares to list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said a six- to eight-week consultation on the rule change will begin in February after the Lunar New Year[https://www.scmp.com/topics/lunar-new-year] holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If all goes well, we hope all the rule changes would be ready in early June and we can start to accept applications for listing from new economy and biotech companies,” Li said on the sidelines of the Asian Financial Forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shareholding structure had been prohibited in Hong Kong since the mid-1980s. These share structures are favoured by technology companies such as Facebook[https://www.scmp.com/topics/facebook] or Alphabet as they enable founders to maintain control of the company even though they only hold a minority of the listed shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ban on the dual-share structure is believed to be one of the main reasons why the city lost out when mainland Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for New York in its record US$25 billion IPO in 2014[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1599023/alibaba-ipo-size-boosted-after-it-took-walk].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to identify which companies have contacted the exchange since the proposed rule change, although mainland handset maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] is rumoured to be among the candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said he also welcomed US-listed new economy companies seeking a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the HKEx proposal unveiled in December, “innovative” Chinese companies with a market capitalisation of more than HK$10 billion (US$1.27 billion) will be eligible to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong as long as they have a primary on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, or </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba, Baidu[https://www.scmp.com/topics/baidu], and JD.com[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jd] are all very large Chinese new economy companies listed in the US,” Li said. “Our reform would allow these companies to list here. I cannot say if an individual company would decide to list in Hong Kong, but we can have a regulatory framework ready for them to consider to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] executive chairman Jack Ma Yun[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] last week said he would consider listing in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange] upon a request by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[https://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said he hoped an ETF connect and a derivate connect would launch this year, but cautioned that more progress on technical issues was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that the existing stock connect scheme had helped to pump up daily market turnover. In the first three weeks of the year turnover has risen to HK$130 billion, compared to HK$88.25 billion in 2017 and HK$66.92 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scramble by mainland China's two stock markets to lure foreign-funded technology firms is firmly back on track, as its financial regulators revisit their plan to create a fast track mechanism for share offerings by what many consider will be the profitmaking stars of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this time, their on-off-on-again plan - first revealed way back in 2001 - is set to have greater substance, say commentators, since the leadership is more determined than ever to inject some entrepreneurial vigour into the economy to drive long-term growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will ratchet up the pressure on Hong Kong, as a tug of war over listing resources gradually takes the strain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend it has prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting “unicorns” - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and has already visited to a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invited them to Shanghai, so they can gain first-hand experience (of our facilities and systems),” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are also reaching out to help them overcome difficulties in accessing the capital markets,” it added, without casting a light on any actual names.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's top securities regulators, including chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, confirmed last week too that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's own securities regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), and its stock exchange are also conducting the city's largest listing reforms in decades, aimed at enhancing the bourse's attractiveness to technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June, large biotech companies, for instance, without strong revenue track records as well as more mainstream technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures will be allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That dual-class share structure, will allow shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends, and is favoured by many tech founders as the majority hold minority stakes but still want to maintain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> (which owns the South China Morning Post) chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC quickly recognised the competitive pressures this put the city under in attracting listings by new-economy companies, and threw its weight last December behind its own proposed listing reforms, that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology firms being courted by both exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland have chosen to list A-shares only - yuan-denominated shares bought and traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges - because of the domestic market's higher valuations and the convenience,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expect to this see-saw game between the two markets[Hong Kong and the mainland] intensifying in coming years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, a would-be, fast track listing mechanism proposed to be launched in 2015 was seen as a winning formula which underlined its efforts to set up a dedicated board for emerging industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was put on ice after a summer stock market rout exacerbated regulator worries about a further slide in key economic indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That board was particularly designed to welcome relistings by privatised Chinese tech firms, which had previously traded in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will the introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong boost Chinese tech shares listed in US?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2131905/will-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong-kong-boost-chinese-tech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Foxconn Industrial Internet - a unit of the world's largest contract manufacturer whose products include Apple's iPhones - received the go-ahead from the CSRC to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai, just five short weeks after it filed an application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The green light granted to the 27 billion yuan (US$4.27 billion) fundraising was the clearest sign yet that the CSRC is now prioritising technology IPOs as a way of bolstering the country's levels of technical innovation - a key component of the Chinese leadership's attempt to create an economy reliant on slower, but more sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the country's promising start-ups have been backed in the past by foreign private equity and venture capital funds, under the so-called VIE (variable interest entity) structure, and could only list in markets such as Hong Kong and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A VIE structure allows founders and investment funds to set up offshore vehicles which can sign contracts with Chinese firms, giving the latter effective control of the resultant offshore vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To woo VIE firms into an A-share listing, regulators now need to amend securities and corporate laws and revise domestic listing rules, as direct investment in China's A-share market is off-limits to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange says it has already started putting together a blueprint to attract IPOs by foreign companies, particularly “red chips”, or mainland companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, but with controlling Chinese shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Shanghai exchange officials said its fresh initiative to attract technology-leading IPOs has the solid backing of the Chinese leadership, further north in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of their agenda is clearly creating the next generation of tech behemoths on a par with established leaders such as Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, with the full backing of the domestic capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the Shanghai exchange beating its Hong Kong counterpart in terms of value for IPOs for the first time last year, the signs are strong that more investors could well take the bait.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should only allow exceptionally big technology firms with multiple class share structure to list in the city to prevent poor quality ones from abusing the system, say bankers and lawmakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing rule reform is exciting as it would allow more technology companies to consider the prospect of a Hong Kong listing and allow investors to be able to participate in these new economy companies,” Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive of China Renaissance, a Chinese investment bank that has helped many start-ups and biotech firms to list, told the South China Morning Post in an interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it is very important for HKEX [Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing] to keep the bar high to maintain high standards while accepting a broader range of listing candidates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is in the midst of its largest listing reform in decades aimed at lifting the exchange's attractiveness to compete for more technology firms to list here instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June large biotech firms without revenue and giant technology firms with dual class shareholding structure would be allowed to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class share companies allow one class of shareholders to have more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders. These are favoured by many tech firm founders as many of them hold minority stakes but want to have control. Meanwhile, biotech firms usually have no revenue in the research period. The current Hong Kong listing rules do not allow them to list here but they can list in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at the US, there are in fact not many technology companies listed in the dual class share structure, but only the very large and successful ones such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abused.”The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abusedFan Bao, chairman and CEO of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX next month will issue a detailed consultation on the listing reform, but Bao wants to see more investor protection measures in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The view is echoed by fund mangers and lawmakers, with many calling for a “sunset clause” - a provision that requires these dual class share companies, after certain years of listing, to seek shareholders' approval to continue with the structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing, however, told lawmakers during the financial affairs panel meeting last week that the exchange would not go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we were to introduce such a sunset clause, some tech companies might consider Hong Kong to be too restrictive and they may not come here to list,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenneth Leung, lawmaker for accountancy, said the exchange could consider setting a longer period such as 20 years for the sunset clause.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of letting the founders have special voting rights is to allow them to have control for a longer time to implement their vision. If they are doing well for 20 years, the investors would support and approve them to continue to have special voting rights. If they do not do a good job, investors should also have the right to say no,” Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A proposal by Hong Kong and mainland China's stock exchanges to let investors partake in initial public offerings in each other's markets has been given an added impetus by the prospect of attracting the US$2 trillion </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is one of several global equity bourses including New York, London, Tokyo, Toronto and Singapore contending to be the staging ground for Aramco's IPO, estimated to be US$100 billion in size. The proposal, known as the “Primary Equity Connect,” would let investors from China's US$7.6 trillion capital market gain access to the Aramco IPO through Hong Kong, increasing the city's attractiveness as a place for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From China's side, Aramco listing in Hong Kong can also provide a “natural hedge” for domestic investors against the oil price volatility, said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the exchange operator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The “primary equity connect” and the Aramco listing in Hong Kong can be a successful combination, as both sides are able to benefit from it, Li said during a conference in the city. “It's a win-win situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li didn't specify on the timetable of the launch of primary equity connect, but said the exchange has been in talks with relevant parties. “We never stop (the talks),” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Li said in his blog that the “Primary Equity Connect” is feasible from a technical perspective, but important work remains for regulators to iron out the right regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The connect plan is the latest piece of a process of fostering closer integration between Hong Kong's equity market with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has launched three of the so-called connect schemes since 2014 with Chinese markets to facilitate cross-border trading. These comprised the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016, and the Bond Connect in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read: What is the Bond Connect?[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2101077/explainer-what-bond-connect]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco, owned and run by the government of Saudi Arabia, plans to sell up to 5 per cent of the oil company in a 2018 IPO in one or more international markets beyond the stock exchange in Riyadh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even listing only 5 per cent of the US$2 trillion company would lead to a US$100 billion IPO, the biggest ever in world history, and leagues ahead of Alibaba's record US$25 billion flotation in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, Li also said the HKEX has finished the consultation on a new trading board and the conclusion could “hopefully” come out in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX started a public consultation in June for establishing a so-called “third board”, after the current board and Growth Enterprise Market, aiming to lure more new economy listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board could allow companies ranging from internet start-ups to biotech firms with dual-class share structures to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX has received positive feedbacks about establishing the “third board”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange might launch a second round of consultation on details about listing rules, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to find new ways to lure new economy companies to stay competitive,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX proposed in 2015 to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February, Singapore's stock exchange started a public consultation on introducing a dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted to list in New York as its corporate governance structure was refused in Hong Kong. It triggered a hot debate in Hong Kong on dual-class shares and how to balance the interests of founding shareholders and executives with investors'.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised on the Hong Kong stock market in 2017 dropped to the lowest in almost a decade as the city slipped down the global IPO league table.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just US$35 billion was raised during the year, down 15 per cent from 2016 and the smallest amount since the financial crisis in 2008, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This was despite the benchmark Hang Seng Index rallying 34 per cent as of December 22, the strongest annual growth since 2009 at 52 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the surge in share prices has not translated to more new listings or post-listing fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised - that includes the sum raised from initial public offerings, rights issues or placements on the stock market - was the lowest since 2008 when only US$20 billion was raised, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funds raised from IPO in Hong Kong dropped to US$13.87 billion, down 45 per cent from 2016. That is the smallest amount raised from IPO since 2012 when the total was US$11.28 billion, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong slipped to third in the worldwide IPO rankings this year, behind New York and Shanghai. The city was the No. 1 IPO market globally in both 2015 and 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest IPO in Hong Kong this year was China's </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$2.2 billion (HK$17.2 billion), a long way off the US$7.6 billion raised by </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has to reform its listing regime to attract more large technology firms to list here. It is therefore good to see </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) propose letting dual-class shareholding structure companies list here next year,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a broker who is also the legislator representing the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, we have to insist any such changes must have shareholder protection safeguards in place.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX recently announced that from the middle of next year it will allow giant tech firms with multiple class share structures to list here, ending a ban that has been in place since the 1980s. Dual-class arrangements - permissible in US markets and popular with technology firms - allow one class of shareholders more voting rights or higher dividends than others.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York took the lead in IPO funds raised, with US$29 billion in 2017, up 139.2 per cent from 2016. The massive increase was mainly because technology firm </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">, which has dual-class shares, chose New York for its US$3.9 billion IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also lost out to </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which has raised US$18.9 billion, up 12.5 per cent from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figures show that Hong Kong is failing to attract new technology companies. Only 6.9 per cent of the IPO funds raised here were from tech companies, a long way behind the 49 per cent that came from financial firms, 9.9 per cent from consumer products, 8.9 per cent from media and entertainment, 7.4 per cent from industrials and 7.1 per cent from health-care companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong ranked 10th worldwide in terms of tech IPOs, behind the likes of New York, Switzerland, South Korea and Shenzhen, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dim sum bonds, the yuan-denominated notes issued in Hong Kong, continued to decline this year with just 65.5 billion yuan (US$9.7 billion) raised, a 56.3 per cent decline from 2016 and the lowest since the market started in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> leads the rankings of Hong Kong-listed equity market underwriting this year, capturing 16.3 per cent market share with US$5.7 billion in related proceeds. </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> round out the top three with 11.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent market share, respectively.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, the first unprofitable early-stage biotechnology company to list in Hong Kong under revised rules, rose on debut on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the Chinese maker of HIV, cancer and liver disease drugs, gained as much as 6.4 per cent from the initial public offering price to HK$14.90 in morning trading. The Hangzhou-drug maker posted a net loss of 86.9 million yuan (US$12.8 million) last year, according to its prospectus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Given it is the first biotech stock under the new listing regime to debut, some retail investors would find it an attractive speculative bet,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director of VC Asset Management, noting the stock had traded as high as HK$15.6 in the grey market earlier. “This is despite the recent product quality scandals in the pharmaceutical sector … stock investors tend to have short memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the listing reform has attracted biotechnology and other technology firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Biotechnology firms and other innovative industry have a lot of room of development,” Li said after attending the listing ceremony of Ascletis on Wednesday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX would continue to work with the mainland regulator to allow the dual class shareholding companies to be able to be traded by the mainlanders via the stock connects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1"> is the latest company to draw the attention of investors after the low profile debut of smartphone maker Xiaomi, after the city's stock exchange loosened the listing rules to entice more hi-tech companies by allowing unprofitable companies and those with dual-class structures to float shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi dropped 1.2 per cent on its first day of trading on July 9 before traders boosted buying of the stock on bets that the shares were undervalued. The stock was trading at HK$17.58 on Wednesday morning, 4.6 per cent above its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong, which is struggling to defend its title as a financial hub in Asia, is facing increasing competition from the Chinese mainland and even Singapore in wooing the listings of companies with the fastest earnings growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China's securities regulator has introduced Chinese depositary receipts to attract companies like </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has also started to accept companies with dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/01/6364db8c-953c-11e8-acb0-2eccab85240c_image_hires_115622.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a wider listing rules revamp that took effect on April 30, biotechnology firms without profit or even revenue are allowed to apply for a listing on Hong Kong's stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, seven biotech firms have so far submitted applications to list under the new rules, including Nasdaq-listed Chinese cancer treatments developer </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, which is the first to apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> currently has 38 listed biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The level of interest - eight having submitted formal application - has been higher than my expectation,” said Charles Chau Chi-chung, a partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Jones Day</span><span class="s1">, who is helping biotech clients prepare listings in Hong Kong. “Earlier I expected five to be listed by the end of this year, now I would not be surprised if eight to 10 will make their market debut by then. So far, the listing candidates that have submitted applications tend to be relatively more established companies within the sector ... they are also careful in their choice of sponsors to ensure success.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The international tranche - accounting for 90 per cent - of Ascletis' HK$2.98 billion shares offer was only 1.17 times subscribed, while its Hong Kong public offer - 10 per cent of the total - was eight times oversubscribed. It priced its shares at HK$14, the middle of an indicative range of HK$12 to HK$16.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said he supports proposals to launch a new board for start-ups on the stock exchange, as he turns his attention to helping students to carry out research in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, whose 10-year career as a minister comes to an end on Friday, will return to where he came from - </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">. He told the Post he has no title yet but the job would involve research and teaching related to fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government a decade ago, he was dean of business management at the university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I first joined the government, I planned to work for a term of five years only, but eventually I served two terms and have worked for 10 years. It is time to make a change in my career," said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 60, now plans to focus on fintech related research and study in an effort to encourage more youngsters to innovate and develop technologies that will help banks, brokers and insurance companies to do business and provide better services more securely and at a cheaper cost.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes this kind of research will encourage more young people to establish their own start-ups. Chan's move comes at a time when proposals by the stock exchange to establish a new board to help start-ups raise funds are under consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would support the stock exchange in introducing a new board to attract start-ups and dual-share structure companies to list in Hong Kong as long as they could introduce investor protection measures to safeguard the interests of the investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) issued a consultation paper two weeks ago proposing a third board - in addition to the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market - which would have more flexible rules to attract ‘new economy' companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board would offer two markets - one for mega listings of big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, the other for start-ups. Both would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter case, Chan said the reason for this restriction on the type of investor is because "the start-up markets are risky."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the board designed for dual-class structure companies, he said if it allowed retail investors to trade, measures should be put in place to protect the investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding structures are favoured by technology giants such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> as their founders own a minority stake but want to maintain control. They issuance of two classes of shares allows the founders more voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Singapore and some other markets have this sunset clause for the dual-class shares structure to protect the interests of investors," said Chan.Hong Kong is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbiChan Ka-keung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government, Chan had spent his entire career in academia. After winning a scholarship in Hong Kong at the age of 18, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from </span><span class="s3">Wesleyan University</span><span class="s1">, and both his MBA and PhD in finance from the </span><span class="s3">University of Chicago</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He taught for nine years at </span><span class="s3">Ohio State University</span><span class="s1">, before taking up a role at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1"> in 1993, eventually becoming dean of business management. He joined the government as secretary for financial services and the treasury in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back over his past decade as a minister, he is most proud of promoting the yuan business in Hong Kong and overseeing the launch of the two stock connect schemes linking HKEX with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a leading offshore yuan centre. It is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbi. The two stock connects have promoted cross-border trading and enhanced Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">James Lau, former undersecretary for financial services and the treasury, will succeed Chan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposed third board to draw technology and new economy firms to list in the city has received a general welcome from market players, but it is too soon to tell how big a draw it will become.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board announced by the exchange in a consultation paper on Friday limits listings to technology and new economy companies, and is intended to plug the gap that the bourse's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market have not been able to fill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The board will consist of two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target large companies that match requirements for the main board but have a dual shareholding structure. US-listed firms with dual share structures can apply for a secondary listing, and retail investors will be allowed to trade in this market.</span></p>

It will have a low entry threshold and light regulatory touch. To segregate the good and poor quality companies, a delisting mechanism will be in place. Firms will be delisted if they failed to meet certain operation requirement, if their share prices fell to a certain threshold, or if they had been suspended from trading for 90 days. This market will only be opened to institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX said that overseas-listed Chinese companies with dual class structure currently banned from listing in Hong Kong, could now opt for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For the longer term, there is no reason why Hong Kong could not attract some big US technology and new economy companies to consider a secondary listing," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he acknowledged that it will be an uphill task as the US is already the largest technology market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the new board will adopt an "easy in, easy out" approach, Li stressed that "the new board will not become a farm of shell companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/6affea34-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]The new board's limitation to tech firms and start-ups aim to achieve what the Growth Enterprise Market was originally intended for when it launched in 1999, targeting the very same types of firms. Eventually, only 18 per cent of GEM firms have links to information technology, while 29 per cent operate in the consumer and services sector and 26 per cent are construction companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the top IPO market worldwide last year but only 3 per cent of funds raised were for technology companies. Five technology firms listed in Hong Kong last year, raising HK$5.7 billion (US$730 million), while the nine GEM technology companies raised only HK$800 million, far below </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">'s HK$15.9 billion, New York's HK$8.7 billion and Shenzhen ChiNext's HK$7.9 billion, according to PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's what different market players say about the third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third new board for new economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">START-UPS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-ups welcome the board but are uncertain if they would list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s internet lending and wealth management provider, Lufax is planning a listing, but is undecided on which market to IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are open-minded about the listing of Lufax. There is no concrete timetable and listing venue about the listing yet," said a spokeswoman of Ping An.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast Education</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alex Lee, a former banker who co-founded online education platform Mast Education with his mother and partners in late 2015, said he relied on his personal savings for start-up funding. While he welcomed the idea of the third board as a new fund-raising channel, his company may not opt for an offering soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Overall, it would be a good move for Hong Kong to have a new third board with the purpose to help start-ups and other new economy companies to raise funds. This would hopefully encourage more Hong Kong young people to set up their own businesses," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast, which aims to provide high school students with university-level courses to boost their learning and be prepared for examinations, has been in operation for nearly two years. It has attracted more than 1,000 users globally, with a large proportion of them from the US, Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said he would wait out till his business was bigger before considering a listing on the third board or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xero</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rod Drury, chief executive and founder of Xero in New Zealand, said unlike Xero which floated in its first year, it was rare for a start-up to go public within a year of being founded. The firm uses cloud technology to help small and medium-sized enterprises better manage their accounting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We did everything backwards. Listed first, then brought in funding from hedge funds and venture funds including </span><span class="s3">Accel</span><span class="s1">, Matrix and TVC," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He recalled that there were few options in New Zealand to secure private capital for a technology start-up when the company was set up in 2006. He and other co-founders funded the firm out of their own pockets, and then listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (</span><span class="s3">NZX</span><span class="s1">) in the first year, followed by the </span><span class="s3">Australian Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">ASX</span><span class="s1">) in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As a technology start-up that went public within our first year, we encourage exchanges and others who offer capital raising options to consider how best they can support high growth businesses like ours with options for capital to support growth," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drury is supportive of the idea of a third board as Xero's own listing has helped the company expand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JabJabX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Yue, who founded JabJabX, an app that stores and analyses data to help users hone their technique in Chinese martial arts, said he and his co-founders tapped on their personal savings of about HK$400,000 to set up the company earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would wait for the details of the third board before deciding if it would seek a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not need to rush to go public because we could find some angel investors or funds who share our mission to become our investors. We would like investors who can provide guidance to us to develop our business and to allow us to access to their network of contacts," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Listing on the stock exchange would help us to raise funds but it could not help us to expand our network. At present, the cost of bank interest rate remains low, so it is not hard to find low cost of funding," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BROKERS AND FUND MANAGERS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - the payment arm of a unit of the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which are considering listings could be potential candidates for the third board's premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange had two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but was quickly rejected by the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC). This time around, the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said they had agreed to the consultation as the listings would be limited to the new board, compared with the previous proposal that applied to the entire market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/60a5aa7e-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]Still, the dual shareholding structure will remain an issue of contention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Investments Funds Association, the industry body of fund houses in Hong Kong, is opposed to such a structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In principle, investment managers believe that "one share one vote" is a cornerstone of investor protection," said Sally Wong, chief executive of HKIFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As for the discussion about the proposed third board, we should not view this in silos, but take a holistic approach and consider the relationships between the different boards. For example, will a third board listed company be "upgraded" to the main board? Or from the start-ups to the "premium" class? If yes, what are the exit or entry mechanisms," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International said the attempt to draw sought-after technology companies to list in Hong Kong had two audiences to placate including the companies and public investor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the balance between the two was not easy to strike, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Voting control through a dual class listing system does not translate into risk nor impropriety. However, the exchange needs to make sure the individual investor's interests are both aligned and protected. The old expression buyer beware cannot be the basis of a regulatory protection campaign because nothing is more paramount in the list of priorities," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Mobius, executive chairman for Templeton Emerging Markets Group, who manages US$26 billion for clients in emerging markets including Hong Kong and mainland China, said he fully supported the HKEX consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A third listing board will give an opportunity for fintech and innovative companies to compete in Hong Kong and share in the success of Shenzhen's ChiNext which has been successful in raising capital for this rapid growing sector of our industry," Mobius said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe dual class shares if structured appropriately, that is where all the rights to the shareholders are commonly shared, will be beneficial to the market as it should allow enterprising companies listed overseas to dually list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/660f409c-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]ANALYSTS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXECUTIVES</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Defining technology firms and the corporate governance that entails would be the issues to address, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The third board concept would be a good idea to attract more technology companies to list but how to define a firm as a technology or new economy firm may be controversial. If a company is conducting online lending services, is it considered as a traditional financial firm or a new technology company?" said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner of EY, said Hong Kong needed to diversify its IPO portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many challenges to the Hong Kong market," Pogson said. "We need to be responsive to the changing financing needs of the market. However this needs to be done in an investor friendly and robust way, as at the bedrock of Hong Kong's success is the quality of process and governance that Hong Kong can bring," Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We need to ensure that are market is ready for changing business models, that we understand markets such as technology, fintech, infrastructure and other evolving financing needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of AIA Group, said international exchanges were competing to attract new listings as the capital markets and the finance industry integrate globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Creating new boards to attract companies under reduced levels of governance and less onerous listing requirements is a hot topic and one that needs to balance the commercial opportunity for the bourse itself and access opportunities for local investors with investor protection and oversight," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology driven businesses have access to many funding sources and international stock exchanges are keen not miss out on what is widely expected to continue to be a dominant sector for growing market capitalisation."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange's listing reform helped to boost the amount of funds raised from IPOs by 78 per cent to a three-year-high in the first half, but that was still not enough to topple New York from the top global IPO spot, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiaomi's IPO not living up to its expectations of raising US$10 billion and some Chinese tech firms opting for a listing in the US and Shanghai, Hong Kong could only maintain its No 3 global IPO ranking in the first half, the same as last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's main board and GEM, formerly known as the Growth Enterprise Market, together accounted for a combined US$11.47 billion from 96 initial public offerings in the first six months of 2018 versus US$6.45 billion from 66 companies in the same period in 2017. It was also the highest amount raised in the first half after US$17.53 billion in 2015.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai slipped to No 4, down from No 2 last year. The funds raised in the first half dropped to US$8.68 billion from 33 IPOs, down 14 per cent from US$10.06 billion from 112 IPOs a year earlier.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This has attracted a number of applicants including the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker Xiaomi to raise HK$37.05 billion (US$4.72 billion) last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's US$4.72 billion IPO ranked as the second-largest IPO worldwide in the first half, as it was pipped by </span><span class="s3">Siemens Healthineers</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$5.17 billion in Frankfurt in March. </span><span class="s3">Foxconn Industrial Internet</span><span class="s1"> took the third spot, raising US$4.26 billion in Shanghai in May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city was the top IPO market in 2015 and 2016 as well as from 2009 to 2011.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There seems to be a lot of interest from new economy companies and biotech firms as many of them are now in the preparation stage of their listing applications,” Chan said. “Given the high demand for Ping An Good Doctor's IPO in April, many potential applicants are confident that their IPOs will be well-received in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than a dozen technology and biotech companies could be part of the first batch to apply for a Hong Kong listing under new rules being introduced from next week, according to Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange said on Tuesday[https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/News-Release/2018/180424news?sc_lang=en] that new rules to broaden the listing regime will take effect on Monday, when the exchange will begin accepting formal applications under a system that permits dual-class shares - a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new regime also opens the door to pre-revenue biotech companies, as well as dual-class shareholding companies already listed in the US, such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not know if companies will submit applications on Monday but I believe they will apply very soon after the new listing rules are effective,” said Li, as he announced the conclusions of a one-month consultation process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many companies indicate they are ready to file a listing application. What they are waiting for is the introduction of the new listing regime.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will not be in the single digits, more than a dozen companies will apply,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li believes the first batch of listings under the new rules will take place in June and July, while a second round will happen in the autumn, after the exchange's summer break.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would not confirm if mobile phone maker Xiaomi, as many expect, will be at the front of the listing queue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I have some idea. I cannot talk, as we are the regulator,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-month consultation on the proposed rule changes ended in late March, after receiving 283 responses. A majority were in support of the reform, but some institutional investors and fund houses called for greater protections for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Upon consideration, HKEX said it would require companies with multiple classes of shares to set up a corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent non-executive directors. Its election will be on a one-share-one-vote principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has decided not to adopt a measure that would cap the holders of premium-class shares to less than 50 per cent of the total issued shares in the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The founders or key management who own the premium class of shares could be in the form of limited partnerships, trusts, private companies or other vehicles. But the shares of these entities cannot be transferred to other people or entities not entitled to own premium shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another requirement stipulates that the special voting rights attached to premium shares will be invalid if an individual ceases to act as a director of the company or if they die.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans to have another consultation before July 31, on whether corporations should be allowed to own premium shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange also provided guidelines for the definition of sophisticated investors who can invest in biotech companies, as well as guidelines on cornerstone investors who invest in the companies ahead of an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with mainland exchanges for global fundraising crown[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is launching the reforms to capture more tech listings, in the face of intense competition from mainland China, as Beijing has also launched a scheme to attract tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, however, said he believes companies could opt to list both in Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Lau, a partner and head of capital markets at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China, said there has been strong interest from both Chinese and international companies in emerging sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect there will be at least 10 to 15 new-economy companies listed under the new regime by the end of 2018. The actual number could be higher depending on market sentiment and how fast the listing applicants can move through the vetting process,” said Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While it is possible that some of those companies may opt to list in China, considering the potential deal size, it is also possible that these companies could also have a secondary listing in Hong Kong to take advantage of liquidity in both markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner with US-based law firm Dechert in Hong Kong, also said foreign companies had expressed strong interest in the reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have some US-based clients who have expressed interest to list their China operations in Hong Kong,” he said. “Our clients would like to be among the first batch to list under the new rules. Some may set a listing target in Hong Kong by the end of this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan added that technology valuations may be higher in the US, but that Hong Kong is considered a home market for many Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“International investors can trade shares in these Chinese companies in Hong Kong, while mainland investors can also trade shares of these companies via the Stock Connect,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will keep up the drive to attract new technology companies to list shares in the city, even as the benchmark share index stands at the threshold of a bear market, having tumbled nearly 20 per cent from its high earlier this year, according to the head of the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Usually when the stock market is not good, there would be a decrease in IPO activity because many listing candidates will delay their listing plans to wait for the market sentiment to improve. However, we have not seen any decline of our IPO pipeline during the recent market volatility. The number of IPOs in the pipeline remains strong,” said CEO of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This showed the listing candidates still have confidence in the Hong Kong market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, speaking on the sidelines of a conference at the </span><span class="s3">American Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> on Friday, attributed the downtrending stock market to concerns over the widening trade war between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Globally, the economic foundation remains strong. There is no panic selling. The volatility of the market is mainly due to the anxiety of the trade war. I could not comment if this will be a short term phenomena or if it will last for a while,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that while IPO pricing was a factor in any decision to list shares, other considerations also played a role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies want to raise funds to meet their expansion plan and to enhance their competitiveness,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are 240 outstanding IPO applications still active and pending for approval, as at the end of August this year, compared with 198 outstanding applications a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX reclaimed its crown as the world's largest IPO market, surpassing New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the exchange carried out the biggest reform to its IPO rules in more than two decades, enabling the listing of technology companies with dual-class shares, as well as pre-revenue biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms helped attracted three dual-class shareholding companies so far this year, including July's listing of mobile phone maker Xiaomi. Seven biotech companies have applied for a listing, while two have already been completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is good to see the listing reforms have removed the regulatory barriers to allow these companies to list here. Hong Kong will be a listing hub for these technology and biotech companies, so they do not need to go to the US,” Li said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected 20 per cent jump in its net profit during the third-quarter, after its largest listing reform in decades sparked an increase in market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, the local bourse operator and owner of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1">, said that its July-to-September quarter net profit stood at HK$2.44 billion (US$312 million), or HK$1.96 per share, up from HK$2.03 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The earnings beat consensus market estimates of a 4.8 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit to HK$2.13 billion for the third quarter, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first nine months of this year, the HKEX reported net profit of HK$7.48 billion, or HK$6.03 per share, up 34 per cent from a net profit of HK$5.5 billion during the same period a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange operator is on track to achieve a full-year net profit increase of 25 per cent to HK$9.27 billion, according to consensus market estimates by Bloomberg.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Despite the market volatilities this year, the market turnover is still higher than a year earlier, which has brought in higher trading-fee income for the exchange,” said Ben Kwong Man-bun, a director of brokerage firm KGI Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In addition, the HKEX in April carried out the listing reform to allow dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list here. This has boosted up the number of IPOs and helped add in listing-fee income,” Kwong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kwong, however, warned of challenging times ahead because the US-China trade war and interest-rate increases in the US and Hong Kong will continue to haunt the market in the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading fee income stood at HK$4.85 billion, up 40 per cent annually. The average daily turnover in the first nine month was HK$114.7 billion, up 40 per cent over the HK$82 billion in the same period in 2017, according to the HKEX data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing-fee income also increased 38 per cent to HK$1.31 billion in the first nine months this year, up from HK$947 million a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising listing fees resulted from a 46 per cent year-on-year increase in the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) to 166 companies during the first nine months of the year. Total funds raised by these firms rose even higher, by 177 per cent to HK$242.67 billion in the first nine months, the exchange data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong beat New York to reclaim the crown as the No. 1 market worldwide for IPOs in the first nine months of this year, according to data from Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The driving force was the listing reform in April, which attracted three big technology blockbusters in the third quarter. They included China Tower's US$6.9 billion IPOs in August, which is the largest worldwide this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other two IPOs were of dual-class shareholdings companies: smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in July, and China's food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">, which attracted US$4.2 billion in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 47 per cent of IPO funds raised during the third quarter were by either telecommunications or hi-tech firms. In contrast, 61 per cent of IPO funds were raised by financial firms in the same quarter a year earlier, Refinitiv data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are more than 250 companies in the IPO pipeline for next year, including many in the technology sector, Charles Li Xiaojia said during an interview with </span><span class="s3">Bloomberg Television</span><span class="s1"> in Singapore yesterday. At least a dozen biotech companies are expected go public under new rules designed to attract that sector, he said. Hong Kong first-time share sales have raised $32.6 billion this year, the most of any listing venue globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This year is so difficult and yet we have had a record year, and it looks like we're going to end the year No. 1 globally,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two stock connects linking Hong Kong to the mainland brought in revenue of HK$521 million in the first nine months of this year, up 88 per cent from HK$277 million a year earlier. The two connects have linked up HKEX with </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> since November 2014 and with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in December 2016 for cross-border stock trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Revenue and other income surged 27 per cent in the first nine months to HK$12.296 billion, up from HK$9.66 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its expenditure stood at HK$2.94 in the nine month period, up 13 per cent from HK$2.59 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> commodity trading income was down 4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of HKEX were up 1.3 per cent at HK$224.60 at midday close on Wednesday morning before the results were released during the lunch break.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government has kicked off the city's biggest auditing regulatory reform in a decade, with the aim of positioning Hong Kong as a hub for technology initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the Financial Reporting Council (Amendment) Bill 2018, which the government gazetted on Friday and is to be presented before lawmakers on Wednesday, the Financial Reporting Council will be empowered to inspect, investigate, as well as discipline auditors in more than 2,000 listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council will take over these additional powers from the industry body, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">. When the council was set up by the government in 2007 it only handled investigations, while other regulatory functions were carried out by the institute. Under the reform, the institute loses all regulatory powers over auditors of listed companies to the council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Bill will enhance the existing regulatory regime for auditors of listed entities, allowing them to be independent from the audit profession, thereby providing better protection to investors. This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and capital market,” said James Lau, the secretary for financial services and the treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies seeking to list dual-class shares may get green light to apply for Hong Kong listing by end June[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2128434/companies-seeking-list-dual-class-shares-may-get-green]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Benchmarking against international standards and practice, the new regime will also enable Hong Kong to be eligible for joining the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators, which is an important forum for international cooperation on the regulation of auditors,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The auditor regulatory reform comes at the same time as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates the city's bourse - the third largest in Asia - is also carrying out its largest reform in three decades, to allow dual-class shareholding companies and large biotech firms without revenue to list as Hong Kong competes with the United States for more technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both moves are aimed at improving the quality of Hong Kong's stock markets as the city attempts to attract more giant technology companies to list and more mainland firms to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lagged behind other financial centres such as New York, London and Singapore because of a lack of an independent auditing regulator. This is also why the city lost out to Singapore in the Corporate Governance Watch 2016 rankings in September.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The introduction of this legislation is in the best interest of the investing public. This much-awaited reform for auditors of publicly listed entities, i.e. from self-regulation to independent oversight, will bring Hong Kong's auditor regulatory regime in line with other major capital markets worldwide, such as New York and London. It will further entrench Hong Kong's status and reputation as a robust international financial centre,” said John Poon, the council's chairman.This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and capital marketJames Lau, secretary for financial services and the treasury</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">, however, raised a number of concerns on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On funding, HKICPA feels the proposed HK$90 million annual budget, a three-fold increase [from current levels], requires further substantiation. Judging from our own experience in regulation, inspection and discipline, the figure seems very high,” the institute said, adding that the government needed to be more forthcoming and transparent about funding, so that everybody knew their respective contributions were reasonable and fair.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A number of our member firms continue to have concerns over the maximum penalty of HK$10 million, which they believe will impose an undue financial burden on smaller firms. Last, but not least, it is not clear how non-Hong Kong auditors will be regulated.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The institute said it would keep on pursuing these issues during the legislative process.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To the millions of mainland investors frolicking in China's go-go stock market of the early 2000s, given a kick start from the country's membership in the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">, Laura Cha Shih May-lung was the killer regulator anointed by Beijing to crash the party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, whose married name rhymes with the Chinese word for inspection, soon earned the moniker of the regulator who would “inspect miscreants to their death”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though her tenure as a vice-chairman at the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">from 2001 to 2004 drew mixed responses, it earned her a place in the history of China's capital market development - the first Hongkonger and non-mainlander to take on a vice-ministerial position within the central government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week, the 68-year-old grandmother of three was elected unopposed as the first woman to chair </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the operator of the stock market, in the bourse's 127 years of history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha's ascent comes at a critical time. The exchange is striving to strengthen its relevance and position as the go-to market for mainland companies in the face of increasing competition from global and regional exchanges, as well as China's Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Increasing integration of the Hong Kong and mainland markets, pinned by the city's Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges since 2014 and 2016, makes China a partner but also a rival as the latter wants to bring home some its biggest overseas-listed companies through depositary receipt issuance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) are instituting much-needed listing reforms to entice new economy firms, particularly technology and biotech ones from the mainland, while cleaning up irregularities and excesses.Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to playLaura Cha</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they are also increasing their collaboration with the CSRC to crack down on cross-border frauds, including going after what Beijing calls “big crocodiles”, or wealthy corrupt mainland businessmen who manipulate the capital markets for illegal gains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means Cha has one big balancing act to tackle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pointing to her previous roles at the SFC and the CSRC and now with HKEX, Cha argued that they all differed but did not conflict, as each institution worked towards the common objective of ensuring that Hong Kong's financial markets grew robustly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to play,” she said on Thursday at a media briefing after she was elected chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha also said she would draw on her CSRC experience and mainland network to enhance communication between Hong Kong and China and foster stronger cross-border cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In fact, the cross-border cooperation has never stopped since the launch of H shares 25 years ago,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, Cha has made mapping a three-year strategic plan one of her top priorities in the first 100 days in office, to look at how to enhance the exchange's competitiveness from 2019 to 2021 and fend off competition from other overseas exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/9092235e-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the Hong Kong stock market gained 36 per cent last year, it lost its initial public offering (IPO) crown, which it held for the prior two years, to New York, as IPO value dropped to its lowest since 2012. The loss was in part due to the ban on allowing companies with dual-class shareholding structures, commonly preferred by tech firms, to list since the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To regain the sweet spot, HKEX officials, with the SFC's support, have proposed to lift that ban on Monday, under new rules that would also allow biotech firms without revenue to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Long-time rival exchange Singapore also announced in January that it was allowing dual-class share firms, in line with the global trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Needless to say, the job facing Cha is anything but easy, as she will have to oversee one of the exchange's most crucial turning points in its more than a century history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha's major challenge as HKEX's new chairman is the listing reform. Although the HKEX has announced the new rules, the new listing regime has yet to be tested. The challenge for her is to make sure the regime will be implemented smoothly and to attract many new economy companies to list here,” said Bonnie Chan, a partner at law firm Davis Polk. Chan has worked with Cha since 2013 as a council and committee member of the Financial Services Development Council, the government's advisory body on financial issues that Cha still heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“She has strong leadership and is capable of drawing on a pool of professional talent to work for the council … We could not have done so much work without Cha's ability to draw the many professionals to voluntarily do the job,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said she would step down from the council once the government had found a replacement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the council, Cha, a career financial regulator, had served on the HKEX board from 2006 to 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/8b50afb4-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha had a relative late start to her career to focus on bringing up her two children and being a full-time housewife for six years in the US where she then lived.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was so hard to get help in the US, and as a mother of two I had to be a full-time housewife. I only started my career after my children went to school,” she had said in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was during that period that she became interested in law and returned to school to read law. She qualified as a lawyer in the US before returning to Hong Kong in 1985, when her businessman husband Victor Cha Mou-zing was called back to run the family business, </span><span class="s3">HKR International</span><span class="s1">, the developer of Discovery Bay on Lantau Island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha went to work at a law firm before joining the SFC in 1991, where she stayed till former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji invited her to join the CSRC in 2001. During the decade to 2000, the HKEX and the SFC had garnered extensive experience and expertise in bringing Chinese state firms to market and instilling corporate governance in the process, while weathering the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's stock markets, created in the 1990s with the aim of raising funds for ailing state-owned companies, have long been plagued by insider trading and illicit deals. Wu Jinglian, a renowned Chinese economist, once described the market as a “casino”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha was paid up to 5 million yuan (US$790,557 at current rates) for her CSRC role, in a specially-approved remuneration package that was several times more than what even the Chinese president was earning, according to mainland Chinese media. She took the equivalent salary of her fellow deputy regulators, and donated the remainder of the pay to a fund for educating Chinese regulators, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Cha struggled to implant mature, Hong Kong-style regulatory practises in the mainland to weed out rampant insider trading in the three years she was at the CSRC, as they would have ruffled vested interests. Changing China's broader political, economic and legal framework remains a tall order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But many Chinese investors would hold her as “Hong Kong's iron lady” who helped drive mainland stocks to a three-year bear market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/96617ac8-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We knew of her as the ‘iron lady',” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai who has been tracking China's stock market since 1998.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not fair to blame the bear market on her, maybe it was a coincidence. No one is powerful enough to let the market rise and the purpose of getting her here then was to strengthen market oversight, not to create a bull market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha returned to Hong Kong after her stint at the CSRC, and has been a member since 2004 of the Executive Council, or cabinet, of all four of the city's chief executives: Tung Chee-hwa, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, Leung Chun-ying and incumbent Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While her return to lead the HKEX has been met with positive responses by her supporters and the exchange's chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, who was recruited nine years ago by a panel that Cha led, her work would inevitably be pitted against predecessor Chow Chung-kwong. In his six years as chairman - the maximum term for any government-appointed director - Chow oversaw the acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and the launch of the Stock Connect programmes.Cha's major challenge as HKEX's the new chairman is the listing reformBonnie Chan, Davis Polk</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said she might struggle to understand the needs of smaller players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha was a former SFC head and she has a regulatory mindset. She does not understand the difficulty that many of the 500 local players have in competing with international big players,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker representing the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope Cha would focus more on promoting the financial services industry in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever the challenges, Cha is seen likely to rise above them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ermanno Pascutto, who recruited Cha to the SFC and is now director of the Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights, described her as “very adept” at dealing with senior leaders and executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Laura is the sort of person you could send to New York, Beijing or to talk to Legco [Legislative Council] and she would do a creditable job in all of them,” Pascutto said an earlier interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are few people who could pull that off.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia's booming technology landscape will become large enough for more than one stock exchange to cater for future initial public offerings (IPOs), according to the chief of Singapore's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector's explosion in the region has had leading regional and global exchanges vying for more tech listings, including Hong Kong, long seen as Singapore's arch rival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asian tech listings are in some ways, a new space,” said Loh Boon Chye, chief executive officer of the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yet no exchange has been able to establish a lead position. Being a new space means there is room enough for a few players; each can take its own track.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/17/183aa842-faa2-11e7-b2f7-03450b80c791_image_hires_205109.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX considers technology - which includes telcos and media firms - among its priority sectors, with 76 technology firms listed already in Singapore, with a combined market capitalisation of US$64 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of the month, South Korea's top mobile messenger operator Kakao Corp will list its global depositary receipts on the exchange, raising US$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh claims Singapore's edge lies in its “strong technology eco-system”, pillared by a supportive government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore offers plenty of government initiatives and grants, led by the </span><span class="s3">National Research Foundation</span><span class="s1"> and official agencies, such as the </span><span class="s3">Media Development Authority</span><span class="s1"> and statutory boards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Startup Genome, the city state ranked 12th in the top 20 list of the world's start-up eco-systems in 2017, down two places from the previous year. Hong Kong wasn't even ranked, but Beijing and Shanghai are new entrants, at fourth and eighth respectively.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, heavy government backing can also work against entrepreneurship and commercialisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent survey of Singapore start-ups by the National University of Singapore's Entrepreneurship Centre found that while more than half of the tech firms survived past five years in business, they were still generating little growth or employment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 8.1 per cent of the 530 tech start-ups surveyed were considered “gazelles” - or high-growth firms that are increasing its revenue by 20 per cent annually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX, however, insists that government support is not its only edge over rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, it signed an agreement with the US's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> that will allow concurrent and sequential listings on both exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh calls that his “east-west corridor”, and that it's part of a wider strategy to draw more tech firms and start-up firms to list in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He dismissed, however, suggestions by the local media that Singapore simply provides a stepping stone to Asian firms who ultimately want to go public in the US, but have yet to qualify.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One can argue that it's easier to explain tech to investors outside the region, but you can also argue that you need to be able to explain Asia or Southeast Asia to investors from outside Asia,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The crux often lies in helping investors understand Asian business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Understanding how your model fits into distributing in Asia is equally important. You could then, because you are already Asian-focused, list on SGX first,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX is looking at prospects jointly with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, but Loh declined to give details or pin down a time when any debut listing might happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange's engagement with techs and start-ups has also spilled into taking private stakes in some promising prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX subsidiary </span><span class="s3">Asian Gateway Investments</span><span class="s1"> last October took a 10 per cent share in Capbridge, a Singapore-based capital-raising platform it helped create in 2015, with a S$1.5 million (US$1.13 million) grant over three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will help companies tap series B funding upwards, allowing them access lists of investors,” Loh said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange proposed revamping its listing rules last month to accommodate dual-class shareholding companies and biotech firms, without strong records of profitability, to avoid losing out on more IPOs by techs and new economy giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share firms must be worth at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) and have annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies with market caps of HK$10 billion or more that are already listed elsewhere will be eligible for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under their existing shareholding structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) is preparing to launch a second stage of consultation on weighted voting rights, in the third quarter of this year at the earliest, with an emphasis on higher governance standards for a small group of sizable listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The demand for a more stringent regulatory regime for companies wanting to use dual-share structures was bolstered by opposition to the proposal from a number of large international managers including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1">, BlackRock and </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">, who warned their introduction could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are considering proposing that, generally, 'one share-one vote' should prevail but that weighted voting rights structures should be allowed for certain companies in certain circumstances and with certain safeguards," David Graham, HKEx's chief regulatory officer and head of listing, said on Friday. "It is not our intention that such structures become commonplace in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he expected such structures would only be allowed for large, fast-growing, companies, and that one investor-protection proposal was to make compliance advisers permanent, rather than staying for a year when listing on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong, a director of brokerage KGI, said the investing public should be aware of the potential risks associated with companies that adopted a standard other than the "one share-one vote" principle since Hong Kong, unlike the US, did not allow class-action lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba dumped Hong Kong and opted for a New York listing last year, raising a record-breaking US$25 billion. The decision to list in the US was primarily due to Hong Kong's refusal to allow the company's request for dual-class shares and a partnership structure that would have allowed management to nominate a majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> said dual-class shareholding structures could reduce the alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders, a key "soft" protection in a low free-float market such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Gaud, senior portfolio manager at Edmond De Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters: "If Hong Kong is losing mandates to the US or in the future to Shanghai, it is good the situation is reviewed. But they would need to balance what they are giving away to the major shareholders, founders and promoters, by not forgetting about the minority shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx said institutional investors supportive of the proposal included </span><span class="s3">Norges Bank</span><span class="s1"> and CICC Hong Kong Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second-stage consultation will last for about three months.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies are knocking on the Hong Kong stock exchange's doors, making inquiries about raising capital under new listing rules, in a sign that the biggest overhaul of regulations by the bourse in three decades may be showing the desired effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 10 companies involved in e-commerce, online payments and biotechnology, mostly based in mainland China, have sought out information from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), according to the bourse operator's chairman Chow Chung Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies are asking for more information about our newly announced listing reforms, including the chance to list here under a dual-class shareholding structure,” Chow said in an interview with the South China Morning Post, without identifying any of them. “None of them have made a formal application, but they are interested to know more about our proposed rule changes.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flurry of interest, less than a fortnight after the HKEX unveiled its regulation change, appears to be a tentative, though preliminary, vindication of the push by the exchange to reinvent itself to compete with New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore for the global crown in initial public offerings (IPOs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will finish 2017 in third place in the global IPO stakes, with the funds raised falling 45 per cent to US$13.87 billion, the lowest since 2012, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York took the crown this year, with the capital raised more than doubling to US$29 billion, helped by blockbuster listings like the US$3.9 billion IPO by </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">, which operates the social media service Snapchat.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read: Hong Kong overhauls city's stock listing rules to attract biotech firms, tech giants to raise capital[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124503/hong-kong-overhauls-citys-stock-listing-rules-attract-biotech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Part of the lure of New York is the allowance of multiple-class shares, or stocks with special voting rights for founders, to be listed. This practice, common among technology companies and start-ups from Baidu to </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, runs contrary to Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That obstacle prompted </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest e-commerce company and owner of the Post, to take its US$25 billion IPO to New York in 2014. For a large stock like Alibaba, nearly US$2.2 billion worth of shares changed hands everyday on average in the past year, almost a quarter of the total turnover of the entire Hong Kong exchange over the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/28/f302ae3c-ebc7-11e7-8d3e-3515408466a8_image_hires_201242.JPG]Several large companies are in the queue to tap the stock markets over the next two years, a pipeline of blockbuster IPOs that no exchange wants to miss out. HKEX, apart from being an exchange operator, is itself a listed company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial Services, and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi are all in the queue for IPOs. But the record breaker will probably be </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, with its US$100 billion IPO, based on a US$2 trillion valuation of the sovereign oil company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read: Why did Hong Kong replace our ‘One Share, One Vote' principle for dual-class stocks?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124799/why-did-hong-kong-replace-our-one-share-one-vote-principle-dual]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have tried our best effort to present Hong Kong as the best market for </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list,” Chow said. Chow and HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia were among the delegates with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor who visited Aramco's top officials two weeks ago, including energy minister Khalid Abdul Aziz al-Falih, as well as the kingdom's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter while China is the largest oil importer,” Chow said. “Hong Kong is the most international financial market in China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/28/ac90a180-ebc6-11e7-8d3e-3515408466a8_image_hires_201242.JPG]To avoid missing out on the technology boom, HKEX and the city's securities regulator announced on December 15 that they would allow large technology companies with multiple classes of shares, as well as biotechnology companies with no revenue, raise capital in the city under new regulations. Companies that are already listed elsewhere would also be welcomed to seek out a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of companies which made enquiries aimed at having a primary listing in Hong Kong, while a few want to check on information about a secondary listing,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even with a more relaxed set of listing regulations, the HKEX will maintain a proportionate degree of shareholders rights to protect minority investors. Snap, which gives its founder disproportionately more voting power than minority shareholders, would not qualify to list in Hong Kong, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to reclaim our No.1 spot, but we will never sacrifice our market's quality,” Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government supports plans by the city's stock exchange to launch a new platform to attract technology and new economy companies to list, according to a minister.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Attracting high quality companies to list in Hong Kong is important to the future development of the Hong Kong capital market,” Chan Ka Keung, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We support the stock exchange in its plans to review local listing rules and to launch a new platform to attract more technology or new economy companies. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will work together to study these issues,” Chan told media after he hosted the opening ceremony at the exchange to mark the first trading day of Year of the Rooster.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last month the local bourse would this year conduct a consultation to launch a third board, with more relaxed regulations than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, to attract technology and new economy companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is the world's largest initial public offering market worldwide based on total funds raised in the past two years. However, the listings are heavily biased towards financial firms, which accounted for 69 per cent of funds raised last year, while tech firms accounted for only 3 per cent, according to a report by consulting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compromise is likely outcome of Hong Kong listing reform as opposing camps stand firm</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said at Wednesday's exchange ceremony that the SFC would jointly work with the HKEX to study the project. In 2015 the commission rejected the exchange's proposal to allow dual class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong on the grounds that such structures did not offer sufficient shareholder protection. Many new economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> use dual class structures which allow a class of shareholders, usually the founders, to have more rights than other shareholders. The US allows such structures but Hong Kong has banned them since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will support the exchange to reform the market to attract more new listings while at same time we want to make sure market quality would be maintained,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would also enforce regulations for the GEM market which has seen the share prices of many new listings rise or drop substantially soon after listing. The SFC and HKEX last month jointly issued guidelines that required listing sponsors to make sure their GEM offerings were done appropriately in order to avoid such volatility. Some brokers said the new guidelines didn't go far enough and urged the regulators to increase the number of minimum shareholders of GEM companies from 100 to 300, matching requirement of the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Turf war between Hong Kong regulators escalates as HKEX director opposes listing reform</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will review the GEM rules in a consultation paper. We will be open-minded to market comments. However, it should be noted that even if we raised the bar from 100 to 300 for the minimum shareholders of GEM offerings, some people may still find a way to circumvent the rule. The SFC will continue to enforce the regulation to ensure the market quality,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the controversial listing reform has received several thousand comments and the SFC and stock exchange are reviewing the comments before making a conclusion. Last June the SFC and HKEX launched a market consultation on proposals to change listing approval procedures to give the SFC a more front line role in setting listing policies and approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals drew opposition from some listed companies and brokers who worried about giving too much power to the SFC but government officials and a former SFC head supported the reform, believing it would enhance market transparency and efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments are not a simple ‘yes' or ‘no'. While some support the changes, some are totally opposed to it. Some have different views on different proposals in the paper. We are working on them now and it will take time. The SFC still believes the reform will enhance market transparency and efficiency,” Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Barrister Laurence Li Lu-jen is the front runner to head Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council, according to two people familiar with the situation, succeeding Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who recently became first woman to head the stock market operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143577/laura-cha-checks-hong-kong-exchanges-first-woman-chief-its-127]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, 47 and a finance and banking specialist, had joined Cha to help establish the FSDC in 2013 and is currently the convenor of its research committee. He has also worked at the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), the market regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Li was the one who helped Cha to set up the council. He is the most suitable candidate for the post,” one of the sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to comment on any appointment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whoever would become the chairman of FSDC, he or she would need to promote fintech and innovation in Hong Kong. The FSDC would also need to propose more measures to enhance investor protection,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li had led an FSDC report in 2014 on how to improve the IPO system, including a call for Hong Kong to follow London to launch different boards for different companies to attract innovative companies to list.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report came in the wake of a decision by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to list in New York instead of Hong Kong, sparking debate in the city over its rigid listing rules. That debate ultimately led to HKEX unveiling the largest listing reform in 25 years in April, which among other measures allowed dual-class shareholding companies like Alibaba to list, as well as biotech firms that have yet to record any revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said it would be good if a new FSDC chairman focused on investor protection and fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform of the HKEX has successfully attracted large technology firms such as [Chinese mobile phone giant] Xiaomi to come here to list. The next major focus would be on investor protection - there are still corporate governance problems in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The FSDC and other regulators should make more proposals to clean up the market to attract investors to trade here,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li spent six years at the SFC between 1999 and 2005, while Cha was the regulator's vice-chairman. Before joining the SFC, Li practised US corporate tax law at the New York head office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li is also a member of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Urban Renewal Authority</span><span class="s1"> and a member of the Social Welfare Advisory Committee. He also serves as a judge on the Regulatory Tribunal of the Qatar Financial Centre.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange could become a hub for mainland Chinese biotechnology firms thanks to a sweeping reform of listing rules, said the boss of </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, the first such company to take advantage of the new regime for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese cancer treatment firm, already listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, is aiming to raise about US$1 billion through a secondary flotation on the city's bourse on August 8. The public subscription period for the shares will run from Monday to Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are a lot of global investors who know biotechnology but who know very little about China. In Hong Kong, there are a lot of investors who know about China but know too little about biotechnology. We hope our listing in Hong Kong can help educate both of these types of investor,” said John Oyler, founder and chief executive of BeiGene at a media briefing on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has the potential to attract many more biotechnology firms to list here as well as the investors to trade here. The research analysts and other related parties will follow. This will create an ecosystem for the biotechnology industry in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Set up in 2010, the Beijing and US-based company focuses on “immuno-oncology” research, treatments that use the body's own immune system to fight cancer. It will issue 65 million new ordinary shares priced between HK$94.4 to HK$111.6 each, allowing the company to potentially raise between US$908 million and US$1.07 billion. It will be listed on the HKEX main board as a secondary listing, after it had already floated its stock on the US' tech-heavy Nas daq in 2016. It closed 3.81 per cent lower on Friday at US$166.52.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is definitely a very important market as our company starts to commercialise our products. A listing in Hong Kong will expand our investor base and brand awareness in Asia,” said Howard Liang, chief financial officer and chief strategy officer of </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in April carried out its biggest listing reform in 25 years to attract giant technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures - shares that carry different voting rights - and biotechnology firms that are yet to generate revenue to list. So far, eight biotech firms have submitted applications.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> should have more power over listed companies to protect shareholders' interests, a study said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The suggestion comes as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the operator of Asia's third-largest bourse, this week started allowing technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology firms with no revenue to list in Hong Kong - the biggest stock exchange reform in 25 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities watchdog should be given more flexible powers such as allowing it to fine listed companies rather than having to initiate suspension proceedings as is done currently, according to a study on corporate governance conducted by two scholars at the University of Hong Kong and commissioned by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1"> (HKICPA).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new weighted voting rights rule is another evolution in Hong Kong's market. As with other developments it is necessary to ensure Hong Kong's corporate governance system remains fit to protect shareholders' interests,” Syren Johnstone, one of the authors of the report and a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said at a media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong rivals the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in terms of initial public offering volume, but lags behind its American peer when it comes to protecting shareholders' interests, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The global financial markets are very competitive, and market integrity is key to investor confidence which can be boosted by sharpening Hong Kong's edge in corporate governance,” said Raphael Ding, chief executive and registrar of HKICPA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government should take the lead and establish a corporate governance unit to protect investors, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong Kim Man, convenor of the HKICPA corporate governance working group, said Hong Kong needs to strike a balance between business development and investor protection to stay competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC should require listed companies to disclose breaches of listing rules when they happen, instead of waiting for quarterly or annual results to include such breaches, HKU's Johnstone said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The legislation is already there. The SFC can easily do it tomorrow,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also suggested the regulator expand existing arrangements to non-Hong Kong companies especially those from mainland China as they make a large part of the Hong Kong market. “The [enforcement] gap leaves investors vulnerable to abuse,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 90 per cent of total funds raised in IPOs and nearly 70 per cent of average daily turnover were attributable to mainland enterprises in 2016, according to figures from the HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Evergrande Health Industry Group</span><span class="s1">, controlled by China's biggest property developer Evergrande Group, surged 37 per cent in Hong Kong on Tuesday, after it announced a HK$6.7 billion (US$854.85 million) capital injection to rescue troubled electric car maker Faraday Future (FF).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Evergrande Health closed at HK$6.3 by midday, pushing its market cap to this year's high of HK$39.8 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm said in a stock filing after the close of trading on Monday that it had agreed to fully acquire Season Smart, which controls a 45 per cent stake in a joint venture it set up with FF last year, making Evergrande Health the electric car maker's biggest shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither Evergrande Health nor FF were available for comment immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF's founder, troubled Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting and other original shareholders, will retain a 33 per cent stake, while the remaining 22 per cent will be held by employees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF was founded by Jia in 2014 in Los Angeles to build electric cars that could challenge Tesla.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But operations in Nevada were shut late last year as Jia struggled to keep afloat his cash-strapped business empire LeEco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He missed an end of year deadline issued by securities regulators to return to China to address his debts. But he explained in an open letter that the key to address all the problems relies on the volume production and delivery of FF91, a luxury EV developed by FF.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese media National Business Daily on Monday quoted a spokesman from FF as saying Jia has managed to keep control of FF, as the company has a “dual-class shareholding structure”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although Jia owns only 33 per cent stake of FF, each share has 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares that Evergrande holds,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may expand its listing reform to allow more flexible structure technology companies to list, according to outgoing chairman Chow Chung-kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The planned move came as HKEX is facing heated competition from stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the US and Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council announced on Friday the launch of the China Depository Receipt (CDR) scheme to attract tech giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's move is seen by local brokers as a way to compete with the HKEX to attract the largest technology companies. The HKEX plans to launch later in April its largest listing reform in three decades, allowing the listing of some companies with multiple-class shares and biotech companies without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the exchange will consult the market after three months on whether the reform should be expanded so as to allow corporations, instead of just individuals, to hold premium shareholding rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with China bourses for IPO crown[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shareholding structure is favoured by tech companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, as they allow the founders and key management to hold premium class shares with more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said on Thursday in a media gathering that the HKEX does not consider Shanghai or Shenzhen as a direct competitor, as the CDR scheme does not prevent mainland tech giants from listing in Hong Kong.We are always eyeing the US as the major competitor in terms of fighting for technology and biotechnology firms to listOutgoing HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are always eyeing the US as the major competitor in terms of fighting for technology and biotechnology firms to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said since January, some tech companies have inquired about the ability to hold premium voting rights as a corporate entity, a proposal which is under consideration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, we would need another consultation before we could move on this step. Allowing companies to hold the premium class shares would be controversial. It would be hard to determine which corporate should qualify,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market consensus is to allow individuals who are the founders or key management of the tech firms, to hold shares with more voting rights.This is because the market also recognises these individuals have important roles to play in the development of these companies.This is why the premium class of shares would expire when these directors die or leave the company,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Financial Services Development Council (FSDC), the government appointed advisory body, said in a statement last month that it believes the HKEX reform should be widened to allow companies to own premium class shares. The US allows such structures to be held by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The FSDC chairwoman Laura Cha Shih May-lung is widely viewed as a likely successor for Chow at the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow, who will step down as chairman on April 25, refused to comment about his successor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said he would like to see the listing reform implemented and the first application under the new regime made before he steps down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the bond connect as well as the two stock connects schemes that link the stock markets of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, to be the most important achievements during his six years as chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These cross border trading schemes established the linkage between international investors and the mainland markets via HKEX,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow also led HKEX's HK$16.92 billion (US$2.69 billion) acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012 as a way for the local exchange operator to expand into commodities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not have any plans yet,” Chow said in reference to retirement. “I may spend time more keeping fit and reading history books. I am watching the Chinese history video via </span><span class="s3">YouTube</span><span class="s1">. I am watching the 76th episode out of a total 100 about the Ming dynasty.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the Hong Kong bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said on Thursday he believed more companies would apply for initial public offerings under a new listing regime after the summer holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many inquiries have been made regarding the new listing regime. These companies' sponsors and other professional teams need time to prepare their listing documents. We hope they can file before the summer holiday in July and August. Otherwise, they are more likely to file in September or October, after the holiday,” Li said on the sidelines of LME Asia Week 2018.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After four years of debate and consultation, the HKEX kicked off its largest listing reform in 25 years on April 30, allowing technology giants with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology companies without revenue to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About three weeks later, however, only two applications have been received by the bourse - among them Xiaomi's mega IPO. The Beijing-based smartphone maker filed its application to list in the city on May 3,becoming the first company to do so under the new regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Hangzhou-based Ascletis Pharma, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in the mainland China, became the first pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing. It submitted its application on May 7.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No new applications have been submitted since. Li said he was unaware of any overseas Chinese technology companies looking to apply for secondary listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing regime has been around for about three weeks and we cannot expect all applicants to flood in and make applications. The candidates will need time to prepare for their listings. I am confident there will be more applications after the summer holiday,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stockbrokers too were optimistic about more listings to come under the new regime. “Many listing hopefuls will let their sponsors start the documentation for listing applications only after they have received the details of rule changes.This is why few companies will be able to file applications during the early stages of the new listing regime,” said Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at global law firm Dechert, said many biotechnology and new economy companies had expressed an interest in a Hong Kong listing, but they needed more time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think we will see many more applications in the coming months, as many potential applicants are gearing up for the submission of their applications,” said Chan.“I don't think it is surprising as the preparation of the listing application takes quite a while, and it is also relatively costly, so some potential applicants may want certainty before kicking off the IPO process.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anti-tumour drug researcher Ascentage Pharma has become the latest Chinese biotechnology company to choose Hong Kong for going public, in further evidence that an impending listing rules revamp will help the city take market share from New York, the primary listing exchange for firms without revenue in the nascent sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Suzhou-based company's board had decided on Tuesday to pursue an initial public offering in Hong Kong, Song Ruilin, the executive president of the China Pharmaceutical Innovation and Research Development Association, told the China Healthcare Investment Conference in Shanghai on Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company joins a growing number of firms that have decided to tap Hong Kong's equity market to raise funds for the development of new drugs and innovative medical products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ascentage completed a second private sale of shares 14 months ago, raising US$72 million. It was led by the Future Industry Investment Fund, a private equity fund by the financial-to-energy conglomerate, State Development and Investment Corporation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> on Friday closed a month-long consultation on a listing rules reform, which will allow biotech companies without revenue and large technology companies with multiple classes of shares carrying different voting rights to list in the city for the first time, as soon as early summer, according to its chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing reform is also aimed at allowing Hong Kong to capture a greater share of the global IPO market, after the city lost it global IPO market crown, which it retained in 2015 and 2016.It fell to the No. 3 position last year, overtaken by New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Chinese technology and biotech companies have listed in New York in the past few years, partly because of a ban on dual-class shareholding structures in Hong Kong and a strict requirement by the city's bourse that all listed companies must have certain revenue and profit track records.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also faces rising competition from Shanghai. </span><span class="s3">WuXi AppTec</span><span class="s1">, the leading mainland biotech company that privatised in New York two years ago, has been given the green light to relist on the A-share market through an IPO in Shanghai, just seven weeks after filing its application.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Tsang Chun-wah, former Hong Kong financial secretary and chief executive aspirant in 2017, has embarked on a new chapter, one that he has promoted since his time in office - fintech investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was last week named vice-chairman of Ion Pacific, a fintech focused merchant and investment bank, and is now poised to be appointed as chairman at BVL, a fintech company that has developed technology that lets merchants verify the identities of customers using the latter's smartphone telecommunication data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang, who is also an investor in the company, believes the technology will help to promote e-commerce. “The BVL technology will be safer and better than current methods such as passwords, biometrics and facial recognition,” he said, adding that banks, merchants and telecommunications companies had shown interest in the technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former financial secretary John Tsang joins fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2149705/former-financial-secretary-john-tsang-joins-fintech-focused]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While he did not disclose his investment, Tsang said the company was yet to generate revenue as it was still in the process of setting up. But BVL has completed the technology development stage and Tsang was in the process of approaching banks and merchants with the service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-born and raised, Tsang is the city's longest serving financial secretary. He held office for a decade until 2017 and guided the city through the 2008 global financial crisis. He resigned in late 2016 and ran for the post of Hong Kong chief executive in early 2017, eventually losing out to Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked if he would run for chief executive again, Tsang said: “I will not look back, as I have already moved on to a new chapter - and fintech will be my new focus.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interestingly, it was during Tsang's tenure as financial secretary that </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s listing was lost to New York. Tsang said he does not regret not giving special preference to the e-commerce giant, as companies with dual-class shareholding structures where banned in Hong Kong at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, went public in 2014. Hong Kong as only just started allowing such companies to list here, after the city introduced its biggest listing reform in 25 years in April.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What we have in Hong Kong is the rule of law, and a legal system that can't be changed because of one company. We can't move the goalposts,” said Tsang. “Someone said Hong Kong was conservative. Yes. Conservative is OK!”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said money was not a reason for him to get involved in banking and fintech. “Hong Kong has always been a good integrator. For instance, Ion Pacific focuses on Israel and fintech projects that will bring technology, talent and projects to the city,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Israel has a lot of technology projects, such as desalination. It will be good for Hong Kong to build links with Israel. China and the US have a lot of trade tension and it would be good if Hong Kong can build relations with more markets,” said Tsang.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, the first overseas-listed biotechnology firm to seek a secondary flotation in Hong Kong under revised listing rules, dropped 5 per cent at the start of its trading debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the Beijing-based cancer drug maker, which is already listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, fell to HK$103 from the offer price of HK$108 early on Wednesday morning. They later bounced back slightly to HK$105.7.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The poor debut performance came despite eight cornerstone investors - including the Singaporean sovereign fund GIC - buying a combined 31 per cent of the international shares offered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> is the second biotech firm to float its stock in Hong Kong under new rules that came into effect in April. Both have got off to a bad start on the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Biotechnology companies are new to investors in Hong Kong. They have not yet made any profit while some may not even have any revenue,” said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hong Kong-based brokerage Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The poor performance of the first two biotechnology firms will have a negative impact on the other six biotech companies which have filed for listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They have also come at a bad time, as the overall market sentiment has been hard hit by the ongoing US-China trade war.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">'s offering was met with lacklustre demand, with the retail tranche - 9 per cent of the total shares on offer - only achieving an oversubscription rate of 1.7 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It managed, however, to attract some strong cornerstone investors, who took up half of the international offering, which was “moderately oversubscribed”. This helped the company to price its shares in the middle of its indicative range to fulfil its HK$6.83 billion fundraising plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is definitely a very important market as our company starts to commercialise our products. A listing in Hong Kong will expand our investor base and brand awareness in Asia,” said Howard Liang, chief financial officer of BeiGene, at the time of the offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong bourse in April carried out the biggest overhaul of its listing rules in 25 years in a bid to attract giant technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures - shares that carry different voting rights - and biotechnology firms that are yet to generate revenue to list. So far, two biotech firms have listed and six more have submitted applications.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, the first early-stage biotechnology company to list in Hong Kong under the new regime, debuted a week ago, and saw its shares slide 32 per cent in the first three days to close at HK$10.02 on Friday.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which recently carried out its largest listing reform in 25 years with the aim of becoming a hub for technology companies, reported a record net profit for the first six months of 2018 as a result of higher market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX said on Wednesday its interim net profit stood at HK$5.04 billion (US$642.1 million) or HK$4.07 per share, up 44 per cent from HK$3.49 billion a year earlier. This is the highest half-year profit since the exchange was established and listed in 2000. It is also higher than the 37 per cent profit growth to HK$4.8 billion estimated by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After deducting first-quarter profit of HK$2.56 billion, net profit for the second quarter from April to June stood at HK$2.48 billion, up 40 per cent from a year earlier and beating Nomura's estimate of 22 per cent year-on-year profit growth to HK$2.16 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the first half of 2018, the world's financial markets experienced bouts of volatility following significant corrections across major stock markets. Investor sentiment was dominated by uncertainties over escalating US-China trade tensions, geopolitical risk in several parts of the world and policy divergence of major central banks. Lingering uncertainties are likely to cast a dark cloud over global markets for the remainder of this year,” said Laura Cha Shih May-lung, chairwoman of HKEX, in her first interim results statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the world enters a new era of fintech, there will be many opportunities as well as challenges. At HKEX, an innovation lab was established to explore the increased use of emerging technologies in various parts of our business, both operationally and strategically,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse's trading and clearing fee income was boosted by rising average daily turnover, which increased 67 per cent to HK$126.6 billion in the first half, compared with HK$76 billion in the first half of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee income rose as 108 companies launched IPOs in the first half, up 50 per cent from 72 last year, after the HKEX in April started accepting dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotech firms without revenue.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's board said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$3.64 per share, up 43 per cent from HK$2.55 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect scheme linking Hong Kong with mainland China exchanges brought in revenue of HK$365 million in the first half, more than double the HK$162 million a year earlier. Funds from mainland Chinese investors into Hong Kong stocks now represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of market turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a large pipeline of ‘new economy' listings which, in our view, could change the market dynamics and structurally lead to higher turnover,” said York Pun, an HSBC analyst, in a research note before the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX traded at HK$229, up 1 per cent, at the midday close before the earnings announcement during the lunch break. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will meet the media in the afternoon to discuss the results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Poor performance by newly listed stocks is undermining Hong Kong's ambition to rival the United States as a hub for technology flotations, and Chinese technology companies are once again favouring US listings, according to </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong emerged as first choice after the city's bourse operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, in April carried out its biggest reform in 25 years, according to John Hall, co-head of investment banking coverage and technology, media and telecommunications (TMT), Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, the largest bank in the US in terms of assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before the reform, 90 per cent of Chinese technology companies chose to list in the US. After the reform, nine out of 10 Chinese technology companies chose to list in Hong Kong,” Hall said in an interview during the bank's annual TMT Conference last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But more than six months later, the trend is shifting back to the US. "Now it has gone down to about five out of 10 that choose to list in Hong Kong, and the rest want to list in the US. The post listing performance of these companies shows Hong Kong does not have a deep pool of investors like the US,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, 2018 has been the strongest year ever for China technology IPOs. And after HKEX approved listings by dual-class shareholding companies as well as biotechnology companies without revenue, Hong Kong attracted dozens of applications and IPOs such as that of Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But share performance has been disappointing. Four out of the five companies that listed under the new rules either reporting a flat trading debut, or fell on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg. Long-term investors too have lost out, with five stocks falling 20-56 per cent below their listing prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market performance of some of these IPOs in Hong Kong was hit hard by volatility. This has led some Chinese technology companies to opt for listing in the US, where there is a deeper investor base for technology companies,” said Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the US was also more flexible when it came to pricing an IPO and successfully executing smaller deals. "In the US, a small offering of US$200 million is completely doable. Hong Kong tends to require larger sized offerings,” said Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong has the potential to catch up. "Hong Kong investors understand the China market better than US investors, although they have less knowledge of the technology sector and less experience valuing fast-growing businesses,” said Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong remains a very attractive place for companies to go public. Having 50 per cent of technology firms want to list here is very good. If the share performance of IPOs improves, Hong Kong may get 70 per cent of Chinese technology firms to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong reclaimed the crown of No. 1 IPO market worldwide[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165850/hong-kong-regains-crown-new-york-no-1-market-raising-funds] in terms of funds raised by all companies in the first nine months this year. But US exchanges raised US$18.31 billion year to date until Friday through 49 TMT flotations. Over the same period, Hong Kong raised US$14.67 billion through 29 TMT listings, according to Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the five-year period between 2013 and 2017 before the HKEX reform, the US reported 264 TMT listings, raising a total of US$94.52 billion, far more than Hong Kong, which reported only 90 such IPOs, raising US$10.58 billion, according to Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jennifer Nason, global chairman for investment banking at </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, was optimistic about the IPO market and said next year onwards a number of blockbuster technology IPOs, including those of Uber, Ant Finance and Lufax, could take place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many innovative start-ups in Asia and China that need to raise funds for their development. When the market is down, they may delay for a while. But if they wait too long, the price may get even lower,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Companies with the right assets can go ahead with their listing plans to raise funds to expand their business. They may need to accept lower valuations now, but the fundraising could help enhance their competitiveness for the longer term,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the world's fourth largest smartphone supplier, reported a surprise profit for the quarter ended June 30, assuaging recent concerns about its ability to grow and join the league of China's biggest internet companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's performance was in line with our internal expectations, but beyond external expectations,” chief financial officer Chew Shou Zi said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday after the market closed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based company posted a profit of 14.6 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) in the second quarter, rebounding from an 11.9 billion yuan loss a year ago, on the back of higher smartphone sales volume and average selling price for these devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sales grew 68.3 per cent to 45.23 billion yuan, up from 26.9 billion yuan a year earlier, beating the market's 38 billion yuan consensus estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Has Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi lived up to its pre-IPO hype?[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2160753/has-chinese-phone-giant-xiaomi-lived-its-pre-ipo-hype]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which sells mostly budget-priced handsets, said its smartphone business recorded revenue of 30.5 billion yuan in the second quarter, up 58.7 per cent from the same period last year, on total shipments of 32 million units.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion from its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong last month, were up 1.61 per cent to close at HK$17.68 on Wednesday. That was around 19 per cent down from its high of HK$21.55 on July 18.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the strong second-quarter performance, Xiaomi could bolster investor confidence for its business model, which company founder and chief executive Lei Jun described in June as a “triathlon” of hardware, e-commerce and internet services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not everyone had agreed with Lei's internet-business narrative ahead of Xiaomi's public listing last month. The Chinese securities regulator asked Xiaomi whether the firm considered itself a hardware or internet company, while international institutional investors questioned the valuation which they thought was high for a hardware company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eight years ago, I came up with a crazy idea, which was to build a smartphone business based on the business model of an internet company, transforming the global image of ‘Made in China' products and benefiting everyone across the globe with amazing products at honest pricing,” Lei said in a statement on Wednesday. “The interim results that Xiaomi announced today prove that this idea has become reality.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi was the first company to be listed in Hong Kong with a dual-class shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts see Xiaomi building up its market position in the so-called of Internet of Things (IoT) market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the past few years, Xiaomi has built a unique integrated internet-hardware ecosystem that acquires users by selling high-quality products and monetising user traffic, a virtuous circle that underpins long-term growth,” CCB International analyst Ronnie Ho and Rocky Zhang wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi reported that revenue from its IoT products, including smart television sets and laptop computers, increased 104.3 per cent in the second quarter to 10.4 billion yuan. Revenue from internet services, which include online advertising, rose 63.6 per cent to 4 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company was still in the early stage of development for its own finance business, according to Chew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid a saturated market in China, Xiaomi has been sharpening its focus on India, the world's second largest smartphone market, and across Europe.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi introduced on Wednesday a separate mobile phone brand, Poco, to take on industry leaders </span><span class="s3">Samsung Electronics</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1"> in the premium segment of the global Android handset market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The push towards the higher end of the smartphone market comes at a time when the major Chinese brands have squeezed international brands in the mass market segment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's top four smartphone brands - </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1">, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - had a combined global market share of 39 per cent in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1"> led the industry during that quarter with a 20 per cent share, while Apple slipped behind second-ranked </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> with an 11 per cent share.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following its IPO in Hong Kong, Xiaomi set a goal to further expand worldwide. It wants to have overseas markets account for more than half of its annual revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Xiaomi remains committed to a business model that puts a 5 per cent limit on the profit margin of every piece of hardware - from smartphones to suitcases and ballpoint pens - that it sells, certain expenses ballooned in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It reported a 4,469 per cent jump in administrative expenses to 10.6 billion yuan last quarter, which was mainly attributed to the one-off share-based compensation of 9.9 billion yuan awarded to Lei before the company's IPO.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will launch a new stock trading system next month, as it upgrades the bourse infrastructure to handle rising volumes and turnover that is approaching HK$200 billion (US$25.5 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be hard to predict if this daily turnover level will be the new normal,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, at the media lunch on Wednesday. “We are now back to the turnover seen in 2015, but we believe the current market situation is more sustainable than it was in 2015.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though turnover reached HK$198.9 billion on Tuesday, it is still some distance away from the record high of HK$293.9 billion achieved on April 9, 2015. The average daily turnover in the first three weeks of the 2018 stood at HK$152 billion, almost double the HK$88.2 billion in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising turnover comes as the benchmark Hang Seng Index continued to set new all-time highs last week, thanks to the capital inflow from mainlanders via the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock connect schemes. Mainlanders now represent between 6 to 10 per cent of daily market turnover in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the record turnover in 2015 was driven by the rally of A-share market, which dropped substantially when the mainland's markets crashed in the summer of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He, however, expects the current trend of increasing turnover in Hong Kong will be sustained for a bit longer because the rally will last longer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new trading system will help to cope with the rising trading volume. The Orion Trading Platform can handle up to 60,000 transactions per second, twice that of the current system and has the capability to be expanded further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The system will go live on February 5, replacing the AMS/3.8 system which has been in use for 17 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The turnover is expected to increase further as HKEX is in the process of launching its ever largest listing reform in three decades to allow large biotech companies with no revenue and giant dual class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong from June. The new measures are expected to attract more mega IPOs of technology and new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Completing the listing reform is one of our priorities in order to secure our relevance as a premier global capital formation centre,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have already received some enquiries about listing under the new regime and we are targeting to complete the consultations regarding details on the rule changes by the end of this quarter.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started the upgrade of its trading infrastructure in 2012 and the introduction of Orion is the last stage of this programme that has led to the setting up of a world-class data centre among others.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of Switzerland-based financial technology company Avaloq will focus on expanding business in China and Asia as well as preparing for a possible stock exchange listing, after handing over his chief executive duties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francisco Fernandez, who also founded the company which provides cloud-based solutions for more than 150 banks worldwide, said in a telephone interview from Zurich that he sees a lot of potential in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The change will allow me to have more time to focus on expansion plans and the future development strategy, such as how to expand further in mainland China and Hong Kong,” Fernandez said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is a big market with a fast-growing segment of wealthy bank clients. It has a lot of good financial and innovative companies. They would be interested in </span><span class="s3">Avaloq</span><span class="s1">'s services,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's clients already include </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1">, DBS, China Citic Bank International and Agricultural Bank of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fernandez's streamlined role will also allow him more time to prepare plans for a possible stock market listing in the next three to five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As </span><span class="s3">Avaloq</span><span class="s1"> is about to enter the next phase in accelerating its growth - both organically and through potential acquisitions - the company is implementing a new governance structure that strengthens both its operational and strategic management,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is open about where to list, but he said Hong Kong may be a potential destination, and he would be monitoring plans to reform listing rules in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the stock market operator, recently announced a major listing reform to allow dual-class shareholding structure companies to list from the second half of this year, lifting a ban on such structures that has been in place since the 1980s.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change came after Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's largest IPO market in 2017, sliding to third place, with New York, which allows listings of firms with multiple classes of shares, including stocks with special voting rights for founders, taking the top spot.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One week after the listing reform was introduced, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has received only two applications under the new rules, indicating that companies may be struggling to choose between Hong Kong and a rival China Depository Receipts (CDR) programme put forward on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi filed a Hong Kong listing application on Thursday, becoming the first to apply under the new rules which permit companies with multiple classes of shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou-based Ascletis Pharma, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat hepatitis C in China, became the first pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply when it submitted an application on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is very disappointing as the applications under the new listing rules are slower than expected,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The companies which plan to list under the HKEX's new regime may take a wait-and-see approach to examine China's CDR scheme. The valuation in Shanghai and Shenzhen is higher than in Hong Kong and they may like to take time to consider if they should list here or on the mainland. HKEX would need to do more promotion to attract these companies to list here,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia had indicated a dozen companies would likely be among the first batch to apply for a listing under the reform.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, although Xiaomi is the sole company applying as dual-class shareholding company to list in Hong Kong, it is a major application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers familiar with the plan said the Beijing-based company was seeking to raise US$10 billion in a sale that would value the eight-year-old company at US$100 billion. The IPO is expected to be the 15th biggest of all time, and the fourth-largest in Hong Kong's history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of HKEX, the bourse operator, were up 1.5 per cent at HK$255.80 during morning trade on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers and lawyers said there are some biotech companies that are considering a listing in Hong Kong, but have yet to complete the necessary documentation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The overall outlook is positive and there are a lot of companies who are in various stages of their Hong Kong IPO plan under the new chapters. The new rules have only been effective for a week and many companies are still in the process of preparing the listing applications,” saidPaul Lau, Partner, head of capital markets of </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect the bulk of the initial batch of listing applications under the new listing regime will come through in late May to end June. Many calendar year-end companies will try to make their submission by end of June, as otherwise the 2018 stub period financial statements will be required,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chairman and chief executive of Capital Link Investment, said the weak response was not a surprise so soon after the new rules were introduced.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Preparing an IPO and readying a date is a true process and one that is very hard to conform to a rule change. This is a positive development and will attract new tech and biotech companies but it's not surprising that it hasn't had a lot of takers thus far,” McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi has been obviously waiting for this change and seemingly was ready. They are also one of the few that can have true confidence in this environment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">McGonegal said concerns over US and China trade tensions have also affected the IPO process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has always been a tricky balance. Bankers and companies pick the exchange, pick the size of the deal, pick the price but are always subject to the emotion and appetite of that market on that given listing day,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at Dechert, said many biotech and new economy companies have expressed interest in a Hong Kong listing but they need more time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new consultation conclusion has only been published for less than a month. I think we will see many more applications in the second half of this year. There seems to be a lot of interest from new economy companies and biotech companies,” Chan said.</span></p>
