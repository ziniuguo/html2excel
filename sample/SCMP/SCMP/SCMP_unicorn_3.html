<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I have a personal story to share with you about the development of private equity, which may offer some indication of how fast the industry has grown over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many years ago I was appointed by my former employer Reuters as the British news agency's Asia private equity (PE) correspondent. When I tried to introduce my job to friends in China, I was a little surprised that somethought PE stood for “physical exercise”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When I relayed this experience to acquaintances at </span><span class="s3">KKR</span><span class="s1">, one of the world's biggest private equity fund houses, they told me they had encountered similar misunderstandings on the mainland in recent years. They had to keep explaining to local entrepreneurs that they weren't a gang on in anyway linked to the Ku Klux Klan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nowadays people in China, and elsewhere, have a better understanding of what private equity and venture capital are all about. Some may not have heard of </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, but almost everyone knows </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and Apple, two high-profile examples of companies that Sequoia helps to build and grow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, private equity and venture capital managers are often dubbed “gods of fortune” by the media. As long as you can get funding from VCs and PEs, your start-up will grow, or at least there is no need for you to worry about surviving in a tough market in the early stages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/12/09/cee358d2-9e47-11e5-b919-9dd19e242533_image_hires.jpg?itok=uKm4UyFT]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But I would like to take the opportunity here to pose a simple question: What is the ultimate goal of venture capital, private equity and all those start-ups and new technology?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is it just about making money, getting higher returns for your investors, or getting your portfolio companies to launch their IPOs as quickly as possible?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Please don't get me wrong. Private equity and venture capital funds are not charity organisations. You must make money, and you'd better make a lot to stay competitive. I'm not against materialism or capitalism. Even non-profit organisations need to build revenue streams before they can do good. But if you want to make a difference, then you need to think about what your mission is.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> has a clear mission to organise global data. </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s mission is to keep everyone connected. My current employer, the South China Morning Post, aims to serve as a bridge between the West and East, particularly Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I recently met the co-founder of a fast delivery start-up operating in the business-to-business sphere who had just completed the first round of funding with several venture capitalists. He explained his business model to me and how the company rose quickly to become the market leader with the biggest network coverage in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/12/09/fb2bf2f4-9e48-11e5-b919-9dd19e242533_image_hires.jpg?itok=4V57hPEc]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then he asked me for some advice. I asked him if his goal was just to grow and become a “unicorn” - with a valuation in excess of US$1 billion - or he should think beyond the number of apartments his company can reach in the city and figure out ways of using big data to help make people's lives easier and more convenient.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That should be the mission at hand, and it will very probably pay off handsomely. The same logic applies to food delivery services and other companies: They need to build platforms offering tools that make life easier for the general public or consumer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is why technology is so important and why it really matters. It is not just about getting start-ups to list quickly on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of you may know me as a columnist for the Post, on top of my other responsibilities at the century-old newspaper. I have written several times in my columns - for which I adopt the pen name Mr. Shangkong[http://www.scmp.com/mrshangkong] in homage to my real and adopted hometowns of Shanghai and Hong Kong - that I am not a huge fan of this “get rich quick” culture I see spreading widely in the financial and technology world.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As you are probably well aware, China is full these days of fast-growing start-ups, and many are single-minded in what they hope to achieve: Grow bigger, get more users (or “fans”) and then quickly sell the company off or get it listed so that the co-founders can cash out and move on to the next project.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some VCs and PEs buy into this “quick money” strategy for the sake of their LPs (limited partners) and high investment returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But perhaps the next time you sign a deal, pause to consider what kind of impact you and your business partners can have to make the world a better place, and what your real mission and purpose is or should be.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">﻿It is not every day that a founder of a tech start-up lists enlightenment as one of its goals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chen Man is no ordinary start-up founder. Not yet 40, she has been China's top fashion photographer for the past decade and worked with A-list stars from pop diva Faye Wong to actress Fan Bingbing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She is also an accomplished visual artist[http://www.chenmaner.com/] and one of her most well-known earlier works, The Astronaut, is held by the Victoria and Albert (V&amp;A) Museum in London as part of its permanent collection. Another two works, Long Live the Motherland and Four Seasons: Spring were acquired by the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco in 2015 as part of its permanent collection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these days, in between juggling shoots[https://www.pinterest.com/kcotgrove/chen-man/] and engagements around the world, Chen is also busy with Big Shot (Dapian in Mandarin), a video-editing app that she started two years ago to give the average snapper the tools to produce professional-grade videos. She met with Apple CEO Tim Cook during his visit to China in October and he took part in a video with her using the app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen was taking a swig of warm water to wash down her daily dose of vitamins when the South China Morning Post visited her two-storey studio on the eastern outskirts of Beijing one recent autumn afternoon. The mother of two had just come back from an assignment in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What followed was not a typical interview with a tech start-up founder by any means.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For one, arranging a photography shoot meant carving out an entire morning or afternoon from her packed schedule, because she needed time for make-up and styling. Ditto the suggestion of doing a video shoot using the Big Shot app. In the end, the timings proved too difficult to coordinate, so we settled on a face-to-face meeting, no photos or videos, and she promised to send some images that could be used.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another thing that stood out throughout the hour-long interview, her first since the app's launch in July, was that Chen does not subscribe to the "move fast and break things” philosophy that is prevalent among start-ups. Nor does she believe in "scale up at any costs” in order to grab market share and secure venture capital funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And until she met with the Post, which pitched the interview, she was not all that interested in getting media exposure so that she can attract more attention for the start-up. Neither was she that enamoured with talking metrics, about the start-up's valuation, monetisation strategy or other terms that pass for usual tech-speak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leaning forward on a Chinese traditional horseshoe armchair, Chen explained how her artistic leanings and professional experience have been fused together to create Big Shot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a nod to the user-friendly design approach of one of her tech inspirations, </span><span class="s3">Apple</span><span class="s1">, the app features a clean layout and easy-to-use hand gestures to cut, edit and combine video clips via simple finger swipes or dragging. However, the inspiration behind the app is to create a "spiritual homeland” for China's growing middle class who want to capture vivid and diverse life moments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Users can also apply existing templates or "scripts” shared by others to automatically rearrange and touch up their works - helping with the professional use of captions, filters and combination of different clips into one composition. The hoped-for results are movie-quality video moments of peoples' lives, that can be managed and shared easily with like-minded people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The script mode is one of our original features, and also the first in the world,” said Chen. "Our motto is you are just one click away from becoming a [professional] movie director.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's foray into tech also underlines how the lines between art and tech are blurring, with advances in technology pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her bet on the app will ultimately depend to some extent on the breakthroughs promised by high-speed, high-capacity 5G wireless technologies and beyond, making real time transmission of big data possible, and the continued enthusiasm of young people for innovations in video communication.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it's the underlying philosophy that drives Chen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I believe our physical body is only temporary, while experiences are what shape us ultimately,” Chen says. "Every time a person sits down and edits videos on Big Shot, it should be a journey of self-discovery and reward for past experiences, and optimisation of them for storage, management and sharing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even the decision to shoot from a smartphone's rear or front lens is revealing to Chen, reflecting a person's character and outlook on life.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rear and front cameras represent two completely different worlds … When users shoot from the back lens, the horizon is outward and much wider,” she says, pointing out how people use other live-streaming and short video apps. "It's no longer a mentality of pleasing others and seeking ‘likes' or rewards with selfies or performance.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And it's this element of enlightenment, or self-enrichment, that Chen wants to emphasise with her new app. She is unabashed about setting it apart from the dozens of short video apps[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2139347/chinas-generation-z-hooked-these-short-video-apps] that have mushroomed in China over the past few years, which lean more towards instant gratification.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Born into a family of artists [her father was a graphic designer], Chen's own childhood and upbringing is a fusion of multiple art forms. She learned painting and calligraphy at the age of three, and initially majored in graphic design before switching to photography. Her photography career took off in 2003 with high-profile covers for Chinese fashion magazine Vision while she was still studying her bachelor's degree at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's latest shoots include a pose of Jackson Yee, a Chinese version of Justin Bieber, slumped in a chair and rolling a pair of walnuts in his palm, and Batman actress Anne Hathaway eating dumplings. It is these kind of life moments that have propelled Chen to create a tool that allows people to capture their own visions in a professional, video format.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even so, the short video scene in China is crowded with not only unicorn start-ups such as ByteDance[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2171702/tiktok-video-platform-vaults-ahead-major-us-social-media-apps-number] and Kuaishou, but also offerings from tech giants including Tencent and Baidu, where eyeballs, traffic, stickiness and viewer time are everything, as they can be transferred to adverts and revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want to create a product that enables a most natural and elevated form of communication, so that users feel rewarded and enriched every time they use it,” she says. "It's easier to build a kill-time app, but that is not my purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even the design of Chen's Beijing studio speaks of her unique visual language. It has a Karesansui [Japanese rock garden] in the courtyard, surrounded by minimalist, white walls. Each room is named after one Chinese character and there's a separate room for meditation. It's simple yet elevating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We return to the theme of how art can inspire or infuse technology and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I believe a good company must be a crossover of humanity and technology,” she says. "The equation that defines me would be the sum of art, humanity and technology.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen says she has always been a techie and a regular attendee of </span><span class="s3">Apple</span><span class="s1">'s Worldwide Developers Conference in recent years. Inside Chen's office, framed photos of her calligraphy and Chinese-styled antique chairs are positioned harmoniously with a Dyson lamp and Xiaomi tread mill. A box of brand-new, state-of-the-art Sennheiser headphones sits unopened on her desk and the doors to adjoining rooms are unlocked via fingerprint sensors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen counts Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Tesla bad boy Elon Musk and Zhang Xiaolong, the mastermind behind China's ubiquitous instant messaging and social networking app </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, among her idols.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recalling a recent conversation with Zhang Xiaolong that was supposed to be 10 minutes but lasted for two hours, Chen said the discussion centred on product philosophy. "We both agreed that a good product should put a user's heart at rest instead of catering to human weakness.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elon Musk is an inspiration because of his determination to succeed says Chen, referencing Musk's June letter to staff[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2153343/i-think-we-just-became-real-car-company-elon-musk-celebrates] when he made the difficult decision to lay off 9 per cent of Tesla workers in order to "achieve the mission”. Chen looks a little embarrassed when she admits that she once used Tesla as her profile image on </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our philosophy is a simple one: only create products that the world needs,” says Chen. "We are here to serve all visual language users. This needs no form of translation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's determination to make Big Shot a success means she now shares the workaholic, hard-charging lifestyle of China's new army of tech entrepreneurs - where 996 means working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's only one standard to test your passion for a thing, which is whether you cannot wait to get up each morning,” she wrote in a July letter, after the start-up announced completion of a US$5 million pre-A round of financing led by Kuaishou. Other investors included Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI) and Lighthouse Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, being famous has also afforded Chen the time and space to grow the company in the way she wants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's been no need to rush this, because we believe a good product speaks for itself,” says Chen, who wants to avoid the pitfalls of being a flash-in-the pan fad. "Whether it's the brand, company or product, having an aggressive initial surge and peak may not be very healthy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen says her approach may have something to do with her female identity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Males tend to be linear thinking, making them focus on tasks and specific targets, while female thinking is more like water, which flows, expands and can find new direction,” she said. "I am definitely not setting out to copy the model of a successful, male entrepreneur.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Chen has created a new Weibo account for her role as Big Shot's product manager - loosening the association with her artistic work as she wants the focus to be on how people capture their own life moments - some of which can be so "touching and creative”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want to encourage people to live the world, feel the world, record and share the essence of it, before putting their smartphones away and getting on with their experiences again,” says Chen, estimating that there are as many as 200 million people out there who would be happy to plug into a community with shared tastes and meaningful exchanges.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia, with its population of 240 million, is a key battleground for e-commerce players looking to cater to the country's growing middle-class. But local e-commerce company Bukalapak is eyeing growth by targeting offline consumers - some of whom may not even own smartphones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Jakarta-based company, whose name translates as “open a stall”, is banking on a network of over 300,000 family-run stores to help bring more customers onto its platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bukalapak, which started out as a consumer-to-consumer e-commerce platform similar to Alibaba's Taobao, is one of several e-commerce companies in Indonesia competing for the wallets of customers. Bukalapak allows users to register and open a shop online, and also works with brands to sell products to its consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, with only 55 per cent of the Indonesian population connected to the internet, companies like Bukalapak see the offline space as an important channel to bring more consumers online - even if they do not know how to make payments online or have never engaged in e-commerce before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offline, Bukalapak works with some 300,000 warungs, which are small, family-owned convenience kiosks that sell daily necessities, or restaurants selling local food. Customers without internet experience who want to buy something on Bukalapak can approach warung owners for help in placing their orders online. The buyers then pay cash to the warung for the ordered item.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We're taking the ‘e' out of e-commerce by expanding into the offline space,” said Muhamad Fajrin Rasyid, co-founder and president of Bukalapak. “In reality, only about 10 per cent of Indonesia's population have bought something online before.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This method is one of the ways we're approaching the 90 per cent of the population who have never bought something online,” he said. It is also a win-win situation for the warungs who work with Bukalapak as they receive a small commission for each transaction they help close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the population in Southeast Asia, is often seen as a key market by technology companies looking to expand regionally. The large population of mobile-first users - Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> users in the world and fifth-highest when it comes to </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1"> - and its rising affluence makes it an attractive market for technology companies looking to engage users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia set to tighten noose on online merchants evading tax[https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/2167067/indonesia-set-tighten-noose-online-merchants-evading-tax]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fajrin estimates that Bukalapak has about 15 to 20 per cent of the e-commerce market in Indonesia, where it is locked in a battle with other players like Indonesia's Tokopedia, Lazada and Shopee for market share. After its funding round last November, Bukalapak chief executive Achmad Zaky declared that the company was a unicorn with a valuation exceeding US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company declined to reveal the investors which led its latest round, apart from stating they are local and that Bukalapak will not fall into foreign hands. In August last year Tokopedia raised US$1.1 billion in a funding round led by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, the parent company of the South China Morning Post. Meanwhile, its other rival Lazada became an Alibaba subsidiary after the Hangzhou-based company pumped in US$4 billion and became a controlling shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Bukalapak plays the long game. It recognises that it's still early days in Indonesia and there are still literally millions of people to engage in daily commerce,” said Khailee Ng, managing partner of the 500 Startups' Southeast Asia fund, which was an early investor in Bukalapak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They've raised less money [than competitors] but their traffic and numbers are comparable,” Ng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bukalapak was founded in 2010 after its three co-founders saw how technology could transform the shopping landscape by helping small and medium enterprises sell online. The country's e-commerce industry is still largely classifieds-based where sellers advertise their wares on social media platforms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">, with payment being done by bank transfers from the buyer, Fajrin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To encourage sellers and buyers to use Bukalapak, the company offers an escrow service where it holds a buyer's payment until the item has been shipped and received, before releasing the money to the seller. Fajrin said this approach was inspired in part by Alipay which offered escrow services to improve the trust among Taobao users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fajrin identified payments as the biggest hurdle in e-commerce in Indonesia. While logistics was also a challenge it is not a “stopper” for e-commerce, he added. Instead, the larger discrepancy lies between the number of e-commerce customers versus the larger Indonesian population that are online and on social media platforms, but have yet to make an online purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People understand that Indonesia is an archipelago and to deliver to the different islands will take a few days,” Fajrin said. On the other hand, the low credit card penetration in Indonesia means that many people often have to pay for purchases offline and that is when many e-commerce transactions tend to drop off, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole Corp, a Chinese technology unicorn that makes the world's thinnest full-colour flexible display, unveiled a foldable smartphone on Wednesday, offering a screen the size of an iPad-sized tablet with the ability to fold up so it fits in the palm of your hand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Called the “FlexPai”, it comes with a 7.8-inch high-resolution screen with thickness of 7.6mm, the largest smartphone display size on the market today. But the retail price is also high, with the top end model going for 12,999 yuan (US$1,865), which compares to 8,999 yuan as the starting price for Apple's latest flagship iPhones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole's lightweight and ultra-thin device, one tenth the weight of an LCD and one fifth the thickness, can be bent more than 200,000 times without breaking because of the materials used, Bill Liu Zihong, 35, co-founder, chairman and chief executive of the company said in Beijing on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is a historical moment we have been waiting for years [to see],” said Liu, who believes the technology will prove popular as it caters to the needs of consumers who want a large display-smartphone that is still easy to carry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meet the Shenzhen billionaire behind the world's thinnest flexible display[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2158864/meet-shenzhen-billionaire-behind-worlds-thinnest-flexible-display]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole's foldable phone, believed to be the first on the market, comes at a time when global smartphone brands are already looking for ways to equip flexible displays on their devices as they seek to update current handset designs that have largely remained the same since Apple introduced its first iPhone in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early September, </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1">'s mobile division chief executive DJ Koh said it was “time to deliver” on a foldable device after consumer surveys carried out by the Korean electronics giant showed the market was ripe for such handsets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, China's leading smartphone brand, also revealed in September that it will introduce flexible displays on its next generation 5G handsets and that the new phones will be foldable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the Fifa World Cup in Russia this year, Royole incorporated a high-definition 2K resolution bendable display on hats and T-shirts which could stream content from a user's mobile phone or tablet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen company claims that its flexible screens integrate more than 20 million flexible ultra-precision devices, 6 million flexible integrated circuits, and nearly 100 kinds of micro-nano film materials to support the usage as a smartphone display.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultra-thin flexible display maker Royole raises another US$800m[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2113079/ultra-thin-flexible-display-maker-royole-raises-another-us800m]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new Royole phone, running an </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">'s Android operating system and offering vivid colours and images on the display, also supports dual Sim-cards, fingerprint recognition, fast charging, and artificial intelligence graphics algorithm which can support 5G applications in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new player in smartphone design, Royole has allocated 200 million yuan to encourage developers to work on applications to support the flexible phones, Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The foldable phone, starting from 8,999 yuan for the 6G RAM and 128G storage model, will be available for sale on November 1 from the company's website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The six-year-old start-up, claiming a valuation of US$5 billion after its latest Series E round of funding, has 2,200 employees working in 20 countries. It started operations at its 1.1-million-square-foot production campus in Shenzhen in June this year. The plant will mass produce the fully flexible displays, which can be bent, folded or curled, for commercial use.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why did you specialise in eyewear? “I've always loved sunglasses and have been collecting them since I was young. For me, it was about pursuing a passion. Eyewear is the only fashion accessory that both reveals and conceals at the same time, which means it's fun to play with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I launched, in 2013, there were few brands that specialised in creative eyewear. Today the whole game has changed, with luxury and even small brands offering well-made glasses at competitive prices. Eyewear itself has gone from functional to becoming a fashion statement.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What makes your brand different? “Since the begin­ning, we have tried to think outside the box. This has meant coming up with fun concepts such as our magnetic system, which allows the wearer to play around with their look. Our earliest design was a pair of cat glasses with detachable magnetic ears.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What inspires your designs? “My dreams! I dream about all these characters that don't exist in the real world. Then I take these crazy ideas and try to interpret them in a way that's functional yet different. This has led to styles with unicorn horns and vampire fangs. Our latest design features a magnetic ridge across the top of the frame, to which you can attach any letter of the alphabet and a hashtag.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What are the challenges of being a Hong Kong brand? “We were lucky as we were picked up a few months after we launched, by Colette [in Paris], which was my happiest day ever. Back then, I felt I needed to go back to the United States to launch the brand because it was the only way people would respect us in Asia. Today, things have changed. Thanks to social media, everything and everyone is being drawn closer, which means there are no more boundaries. Where you are based doesn't matter any more as long as you have a great product.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What eyewear trends are you most excited about? “People are talking about such things as augmented-reality glasses but I want to keep the line relatively classic while working around our signature magnetic strip.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past two years, 1990s micro baby glasses have come back, so we've included a few styles in our recent collection. I've also noticed a lot of accessories are popping up, including eyewear chains. We are also seeing sporty trends like the Oakley styles. Eyewear is closer to catwalk trends than ever before.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What next? “Two years ago we did an interesting collaboration with an artist in Los Angeles, who made sunglasses out of ceramics. I loved the fact that it wasn't just commercial and that we were exploring the idea of glasses as wearable art. I want to do more of this!”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We address your thoughts, questions and statements from the previous meeting. Have something to say? Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is fair to say connections were not thrilled with the effort Friends Of Ka Ying put into the Class Three Oi Man Handicap (1,650m) at Happy Valley on Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Caspar Fownes-trained seven-year-old enjoyed a nice run in transit after Zac Purton settled him third, one-off the rail after jumping from the outside barrier, but he did not put in when required.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Friends Of Ka Ying had been following the eventual winner Faithful Trinity and loomed up to challenge at the top of the straight but “did not want to stick his neck out”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That horse is officially barred by me— Zac Purton (@zpurton) September 12, 2018[https://twitter.com/zpurton/status/1039895290076061701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the second time in the space of four days the gelding was narrowly beaten, those involved not convinced the horse had the necessary desire to win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has been a bit of a fall from grace for Friends Of Ka Ying, who won the Group One J.J. Atkins at Eagle Farm when he raced in Australia as Almalad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only four meetings into the Hong Kong season and Friends Of Ka Ying already has two narrow seconds to his name this term. This time, it was Faithful Trinity and @mattLchadwixk[https://twitter.com/mattLchadwixk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] who prevailed, giving the rider a double from three races at Happy Valley #HKRacing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKRacing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #HappyWednesdayHK[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HappyWednesdayHK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/nWsqWCp98j[https://t.co/nWsqWCp98j]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) September 12, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1039853540200525824]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One interesting fact came through on </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1"> after the race, with @jdkayll revealing “Friends Of Ka Ying is the only active horse to have raced in a Winx-less Cox Plate”. He ran in the race as a three-year-old in 2014, finishing well down the track behind Adelaide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So clearly ability is not the issue for Friends Of Ka Ying, but attitude is and the champion jockey doesn't want to waste his time with him any more.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rookie is off to a flying start this season and while he probably won't displace John Size as the best trainer in town, he couldn't have done much more in the first four meetings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting has done a great job with four winners, a second and a third from nine runners to sit second in the trainers' championship behind the guru Tony Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jimmy Ting, the new king of Hong Kong racing!!— Darren Gray (@grayposse) September 12, 2018[https://twitter.com/grayposse/status/1039862933319110657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is certainly building a reputation as the first race specialist, winning three of the four openers so far, but the 45-year-old is keeping it in perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My horses are all Class Five horses - that's why I'm having success in race one,” Ting said with a smile on Wednesday night.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But his early success will pay dividends with owners, who are always looking for an edge and Ting will be the recipient of more horses (he currently has 43 in work) if he can keep this up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a clear map to follow - the one set by Frankie Lor Fu-chuen last season.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has a high chance of reclaiming a spot in the top three global IPO league table in the second half of the year, with the total capital raised expected to reach as much as HK$140 billion (US$17.8 billion) from a flurry of new economy listings that would include well-known Chinese technology unicorns, according to Deloitte on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The potential pipeline of unicorns and mega listings include smartphone vendor Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] - expected to list soon - and telecoms tower operator China Tower, which has filed a listing application to the Hong Kong stock exchange to raise as much as US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is there enough funding in Hong Kong for multiple unicorn IPOs at the same time?[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2151283/there-enough-funding-hong-kong-multiple-unicorn-ipos-same]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another potential candidate is ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing[https://www.scmp.com/topics/didi-chuxing], reportedly considering a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in the second half and hopeful of securing a valuation of between US$70 billion to US$80 billion. Restaurant review and delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping is also mulling a Hong Kong listing to raise US$6 billion, according to various media reports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Others such as mainland Chinese live streaming platform Yingke has also applied for a Hong Kong listing while rival Douyu TV, backed by Tencent, video and photo-sharing app Kuaishou, and online ticketing provider Maoyan Weiying are considering going public in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ranking in the global IPO league table slipped to No 5 in the first half of the year in the absence of big IPOs, with total funds raised dropping a two-year low of HK$50.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-head Deloitte China's national public offering group, expected Hong Kong to climb back to the top three list in the rest of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Starting July, we are going to see many listings by new economy companies, including some famous Chinese unicorns, thanks to the stock exchange's listing rule changes,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He anticipated at least five mega listings in the second half - each raising more than HK$10 billion - from the so-called new economy sector, like fintech, emerging tech, and consumer industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the year, Au has forecast 180 IPOs to raise a total of between HK$160 billion to HK$190 billion, up 25 per cent to 48 per cent from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where do blockbuster IPOs stand as the fizz goes out of Hong Kong's stock trading debuts?[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2148830/where-do-blockbuster-ipos-stand-fizz-goes-out-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“More than half of this year's IPO fundraising will come from the new economy sector,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months, the consumer sector saw the most number of new listings, making up 33 per cent of the total IPOs, up from the 21 per cent recorded for 2017. By value, the sector accounted for 13 per cent of the total funds raised, up from 3 per cent a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest IPO in the first half was the US$1.1 billion offering by Ping An Good Doctor, a Chinese online medical service platform and a unit of Ping An Insurance Group[https://www.scmp.com/topics/ping-insurance].</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Au said downside risks included a stronger US dollar that will trigger fund outflows and US-China trade uncertainty[http://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war] that could dent investor appetite, which will affect the listing window of big IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, Shanghai has also benefited from the massive offering of </span><span class="s3">Foxconn Industrial Internet</span><span class="s1">, which collected US$4.2 billion, the second biggest IPO in the world in the first half. Total funds raised on the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> reached US$9.4 billion for the first half, ranking it the third among global bourses.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Au expected the Chinese IPO market to become less active in the second half, as regulators tighten IPO approvals to ensure market stability when Chinese depositary receipts hit the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of IPOs could more than halve to 120 to 160 in 2018, while funds raised would correspondingly drop 13 per cent to 26 per cent to 170 billion yuan (US$26.3 billion) to 200 billion yuan for the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“CDRs by big Chinese companies will draw liquidity from the market, and regulators want to maintain the stability and protect small investors from potential wild fluctuations,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The A share market is more fragile, as retail investors account for 90 per cent of the total.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Harry Potter had a holiday home in the Mediterranean, it would look like this 17th-century farmhouse on the Maltese island of Gozo. Named Diagon Alley because of its location in a narrow backstreet, the 4,000 sq ft, four-bedroom house is spread over four floors, linked by staircases that lead off and around a central courtyard. It has castle-like crenellations, uneven walls that are more than one metre thick, a maze of rooms with vaulted ceilings and a cavernous underground swim­ming pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is the third house in the area that ex-Hongkonger Fox Daniels has bought and renovated. She and her husband, Paul, moved to Malta five years ago for a more relaxed pace of life, having had their fill of Hong Kong's bustle. When Diagon Alley came onto the market last year, the couple snapped it up with a view to renting it out as a holiday home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is one of the oldest farmhouses on the island,” says Daniels, an artist and ardent Harry Potter fan. “A Danish couple holidayed in this house for 30 years and decided to sell it because they were too old to travel. It hadn't been updated since they bought it so that became my job.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, Daniels has a flair for interior design, having renovated several properties, including a house in Yuen Long that she kitted out to look like a 20th-century Shanghainese bordello.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My style is very theatrical and I don't like my homes to follow a standard format,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A guided tour via FaceTime starts on the ground floor, which is level with the main courtyard and houses the kitchen and living and dining rooms as well as the Severus Snape bedroom and en suite bathroom. Each bedroom is dedicated to one of Harry Potter's teachers and is announced by an enchanting black-and-white door sign, inscribed with magical-looking calligraphy. The ancient-looking Albus Dumbledore room is hidden in the basement; and the Minerva McGonagall and Aurora Sinistra bedrooms, both of which have private terraces, are on the first floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I gave the best rooms to the witches,” laughs Daniels.The quality of the light in each house I have worked with dictates its colour. A lot of natural stone can make a house a bit dark so, in addition to the bright colours, I blue-washed the walls to give the house a liftFox Daniels</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A vibrant blue-and-yellow scheme runs through the house - blue to echo the colour of the Maltese sky and to emphasise the house's Moorish roots; and yellow, says Daniels, to embody the joy of holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The quality of the light in each house I have worked with dictates its colour,” she says. “A lot of natural stone can make a house a bit dark so, in addition to the bright colours, I blue-washed the walls to give the house a lift.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Diagon Alley's original structure didn't change, she created a couple of bath­rooms from existing spaces so that three of the bedrooms would have en-suites. She also designed and installed a white Victorian spiral staircase because there was no internal access between the ground and first floors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it was a working farm, the animals were kept in the basement and on the ground floor. The farmer and his family lived on the first floor and didn't want animal sounds and smells wafting up an open staircase,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daniels sourced furniture and finishes from local craftspeople, including Moorish-style tiles that can be seen indoors and out, on floors, arches and walls. She also found boxes of Scandinavian furniture and knick-knacks that had been left behind by the previous owners. With an eye for turning trash into treasure, Daniels gave many of these pieces a lick of yellow paint to match the doors, window frames and custom-made furniture, or turned them into decorative objects. However, she left untouched several features that hinted at the house's former life. There are holes in the living-room walls that once contained iron rings to tie up the livestock; alcoves in the Severus Snape bedroom were originally feeding troughs for bulls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daniels' biggest challenge was the creation of the spectacular Leaky Cauldron swimming pool in the basement. The long, low space had been used to store food and farming equipment, so 47 cubic metres of stone - a volume equivalent to three times the size of the original room - had to be excavated to create sufficient depth for the pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I allocated five days to do it as it wouldn't have been fair on my neighbours to prolong the noise and dust,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A practical kitchenette services another alfresco dining terrace on the second floor; one final flight of stairs takes you up to the rooftop sun deck, from where you can enjoy open sea views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I love the colour and the silence of this place,” says Daniels. “You can fall out of love with a project but that hasn't happened with this one. We live in the next village but even we come here for a break.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Living room The sofa and armchair cost a total of €700 (US$812) from Orienta[http://www.orienta.com.mt/], in Gozo, Malta. The rug, fireplace tools, urns, candleholders, side tables and mirrors all belonged to the house's previous owners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dining room The resin antler ceiling light was €1,000 from Silhouette The Light Shop in Gozo (tel: 356 2155 9048). The candlesticks, vases, easel, dining table, chairs and chest of drawers came with the house. The stone shelf is part of the house's structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kitchen The kitchen cabinetry was given a makeover with yellow paint and new doorknobs. Fox Daniels[http://foxdaniels.net/] replaced all the appliances. The wall clocks, easel and stone wall sconces came with the house while the brass sconces were €90 each from Silhouette The Light Shop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outdoor terrace and kitchenette The teak outdoor table, chairs, parasol and large wicker basket came with the house. The previous owners had used the indoor space as an office but Daniels turned it into a barbecue kitchen and painted the shelves yellow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Swimming pool Named after the wizards' pub in the fictional Diagon Alley, the Leaky Cauldron basement swimming pool is heated year round and lit by atmospheric green lights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Minerva McGonagall bedroom Daniels transformed a walk-in wardrobe into a bathroom alcove and installed a yellow sink unit and mirror, which were made by Gozo carpenter George Grech (tel: 356 2155 3653). He also made the wardrobe and mirror next to it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The black-and-white tiles cost €25 per square metre from Distinct Homes[https://www.distincthomes.com.mt/], in Malta. The armchair was €395 from Orienta and the brass lamp behind it was bought for €30 at a car boot sale. The sconces and hats had been left in the house by its previous owners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Aurora Sinistra bedroom The wrought-iron bed (€350) was custom made and spray-painted by an ironmonger and the blue bedcover and pillows set cost €250 from eBay UK[https://www.ebay.co.uk/]. Daniels bought 20 flat-packed MDF wall-mounted unicorn heads (€30 each) from Etsy UK[https://www.etsy.com/uk/] and scattered them throughout the house. Grech spray-painted them for her. The rug belonged to the house's previous owners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rooftop The rooftop boasts spectacular sea views, on a clear day all the way to Sicily. However, the only way up is via outdoor stairs. The loungers cost £530 (US$702) each from Hayes Garden World[https://www.hayesgardenworld.co.uk/], in Britain. The banana-fibre Alseda floor “stool” (HK$250) is available from Ikea[https://www.ikea.com/hk/en/]. The wrought- iron table and chairs (€180) came from Alfresia[https://www.alfresia.co.uk/], in Britain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tried + tested</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yellow fever Fox Daniels found a yellow version of the traditional beige mosquito netting common in all hardware shops on Gozo, and used it to hide the outdoor air-conditioning units and cover the external doors. To the latter she added fishing nets strung with small buoys, which were given to her by her builder, who is also a fisherman. The netting came from Dominic Department Stores[http://www.ddsmalta.com/].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The blue-and-white porcelain Skyros Deco Blanco tiles (seen in the courtyard and throughout the house) cost €25 per square metre from Meric Interiors (Triq L- Imgarr, Ghajnsielem, Gozo, tel: 356 9947 8562) and the winking sun wall decoration was custom made by Gozo Pottery Barn[http://www.gozopotterybarn.com/].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The object with four bells was found when excavating the basement and is thought to have accompanied the statue of the village saint as it was carried through the streets on feast days.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed live-streaming platform Douyu has been removed from a number of Chinese smartphone app stores. The Wuhan-based answer to Twitch was not available on Apple's China app store on Wednesday and a search of Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> smartphone stores only showed a basic version with limited functionality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. The removal from app stores would prevent new users from downloading the app but not affect existing users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The app's removal follows a crackdown by Beijing on content it deems inappropriate - which includes “pornography” and “illegal” online content, according to a </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> report in August. Users of live-streaming sites in China now need to register under real names, while platforms should set up a black list of offending broadcasters, and improve vetting mechanisms to guard against illegal or harmful content, </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> said, citing an industry notice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The moves comes as Weibo, China's answer to </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1">, announced it would be stopping any new users registering for its services under 14 years' old.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April, four news apps, including Jinri Toutiao and ifeng News, were removed from app stores for two weeks amid a move by authorities to “clean up” the broadcasting environment. In July, Nasdaq-listed video sharing site Bilibili was pulled for a month after being criticised by state-owned television for inappropriate content. China has now has shut down more than 13,000 websites in the last three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu banned one of its hosts Chen Yifaer in August over comments about the Nanking massacre, a mass murder committed by Japanese troops in 1938, and vowed to have all hosts attend regular patriotic education sessions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2014, Douyu has grown into a unicorn - a term for start-ups that have a valuation over US$1 billion - and was valued at over US$2.4 billion in its latest round of fundraising in March, when Tencent invested US$630 million.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By most accounts, China is home to the biggest active user base of live streaming, with industry revenue expected to grow from last year's US$5.5 billion to US$16.5 billion by 2022, according to figures included in a filing by Huya, another Chinese live-streaming game platform listed on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China also has the world's largest games market in terms of revenue and gamers, according to consultancy Frost &amp; Sullivan Research. The country had 646 million gamers as of last year and this is expected to grow to 917 million by 2022.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese online entertainment portal LeTV has invested US$700 million in car-hailing company Yidao Yongche for a controlling 70 per cent stake, according to media reports[http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/20/yidao-yongche-a-lesser-rival-to-uber-in-china-raises-700m-at-a-1b-valuation/#.q9smht:Xger] this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yidao Yongche isa distant No4 player in the Chinese market with a 2.7 per cent share as of the second quarter of this year, according to Chinese consultancy firm Analysys International. Other analysts say its true share may be as low as 1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also has a presence in over 20 cities in the US and other countries, mainly catering to non-English-speaking Chinese, according to China's state media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The extra funding raises the company's valuation to about US$1 billion, making it another Chinese unicorn,and shows how much faith LeTV has in China's car-hailing market, which is facing regulatory challenges and a backlash from established taxi operators.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese car-sharing services have been spending heavily this year to expand their market reach, but new government regulations may make it harder for them to turn a profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drivers have also complained that the government clampdown is making more of their peers ditch the apps[http://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-gaming/article/1868361/any-one-us-could-be-next-victim-more-chinese-drivers-ditch-car] as their attractiveness wanes and attendant risks multiply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ministry of Transport proposed a new set of rules on October 10 with stricter controls. These require drivers working for such apps to have at least three years' driving experience, pass a government test, and the car needs to be registered as a taxi.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The companies must house their servers in China and let the local authorities dictate the fees they charge, the size of their fleet and the areas in which they can operate, among other conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed regulations are open for feedback for a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite these challenges, LeTV, which also sells smartphones in addition to its video site and other interests including robotics,has grand ambitions for its internet car business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said the deal with Yidao Yongche is a crucial next step in its electric car project, after it announced last year that it plans to produce its own electric cars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">LeTV has already struck a deal with British luxury car maker </span><span class="s3">Aston Martin</span><span class="s1"> to provide it with in-car entertainment.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Phang Yew Kiat said with the licence it hopes to operate a virtual bank based on an open platform concept and make its customers' data available to third parties, allowing them to offer their own wealth management and private banking solutions upon customers' consent.</span></p>

The HKMA has set August 31 as the deadline for applications, and new licences are expected to be issued around the end of this year or the first quarter of 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By allowing third parties to directly access clients' data and manage their investments and use of funds on its open platform, Phang said Chong Sing is effectively embracing the open banking regulations used in the UK, or the Second Payment Services Directive (commonly known as PSD2) of the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">. Both of these aim to foster more competition and innovation, and to level the playing field for new payment-services providers that have emerged in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes the virtual bank licence will help Chong Sing to spearhead that trend in Hong Kong too. Apart from wealth management and private banking services, the company also plans to offer payment services, such as cross-border money transfer through the virtual bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It plans to acquire its customers through online channels, and support them through smartphone apps and video calls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the virtual banks will only operate online, with no physical branch network, the regulator will require them to have at least one bricks-and-mortar office that can also handle complaints from customers. Phang said it plans to maintain one such customer support centre that will operate for up to 18 hours per day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, </span><span class="s3">Chong Sing Holdings</span><span class="s1"> Fintech offers a wide array of online loans, spanning mortgages, consumer loans, and loans for small enterprises. It claims a registered user base of 73 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Phang was previously a principal director of Standard Chartered private bank, and had served as deputy CEO at </span><span class="s3">China Bohai Bank</span><span class="s1">, in which </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> is the second-biggest shareholder.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There wasn't much talk about shared office space in Shanghai one year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in the interim period, a number of operators and developers have set up co-working office space leasing concepts featuring a chic environment, modern furniture and smart services. The new arrivals include New York-based WeWork, the biggest player in the co-working industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeWork announced last week it plans to set up its regional Asia-Pacific headquarters in Shanghai, according to a report by Shanghai-based Thepaper.cn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A unicorn startup with 7 million square feet leased in 12 countries, WeWork entered China earlier this year and chose Shanghai as its first stop. The company currently operates three locations in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Shanghai has the largest office stock in China, which means Shanghai has the highest concentration of companies/businesses. Shanghai is also the financial centre of China. Even for small businesses or start-ups, access to capital is vital to their success,” said Joe Zhou, head of research at </span><span class="s3">Jones Lang LaSalle</span><span class="s1"> in China.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While WeWork also expanded into Hong Kong in August, David Ji, head of research and consultancy for greater China at Knight Frank, believes the cheaper rental is the key reason WeWork decided to base the business in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Office supply in Hong Kong is very scarce, the share-based office cost wouldn't be lower than traditional office space, ” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeWork declined to comment on the reasons it chose Shanghai for regional headquarters instead of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, co-working space has also grown significantly in Beijing. Between the Chinese capital and Shanghai, more than 500 co-working sites have been set up over the past 18 months, JLL data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UR Work, a Beijing-based co-working space provider founded last year, has seen its market value expand to 5.5 billion yuan following a series-B round of fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 40 sites its has set up since its launch, about half are located in Beijing, while the remainder are spread across nine other cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UR Work has started strategic cooperation with Alibaba Cloud earlier this year, the cloud serviced arm of China's </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">. Alibaba will provide technical assistance to entrepreneurs using UR Work.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most recently, </span><span class="s3">Longfor Properties</span><span class="s1">, one of the largest mainland developers, also plans to open its first two co-working spaces, in Shanghai and Beijing, by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said it will use the spare spaces at its shopping malls and expects to see the synergies with retailers in the mall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dynamic economic growth in IT and finance and demographic changes, including the two-child policy, will create more opportunities for niche sectors such as co-working space to take hold, said Kenneth Rhee, the Urban Land Institute chief representative for the Chinese Mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies are also switching on to the use of co-working spaces. “More large corporations are increasingly considering co-working options for some of their business units or functions,” JLL's Zhou said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Zhou doesn't expect significant impact on demand for traditional office space, as the coworking community primarily caters to start-ups, freelancers and small businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou cautioned that the dramatic increase in coworking space could wind up increasing office supply, pushing down rental rates and eventually leading to a wave of consolidation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Coworking is not just providing space. The successful coworking operators offer a platform, a community and experience which we found their tenants value most,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s sports arm Alisports is teaming up with Chinese gym and sports retail outlet operator Hosa in a bid to expand its “new retail” offerings for sports products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strategic partnership, announced on Tuesday, will see Alisports and Hosa work together in integrating online and offline commerce. As part of the agreement, Alisports will carry Hosa's products on its Alisports online store on the Tmall marketplace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hosa, which operates a network of 160 gyms in China as well as a chain of Hosa sportswear stores, will also work with Alisports in developing sports training courses which will be promoted and sold offline in Hosa's retail stores. The Hong Kong-listed sporting goods retailer will also share with Alisports its consumer shopping pattern data as well as data on its gym members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hosa is a sports and fitness company that advocates exercise and a healthy lifestyle, and Alisports is an internet company that is on a mission to make exercise easy for everyone. Together, we can do more for the sports and fitness industry,” said Zhang Dazhong, chief executive of Alisports in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alisports in April closed a US$190 million Series A funding round led by Hong Kong-based Yunfeng Capital, which counts Alibaba's Jack Ma as one of its founders. The funding round gave Alisports a valuation of over US$1 billion, making it a unicorn company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company also last month acquired Chinese fitness app Ledongli, which offers a steps tracking app that has amassed over 55 million users as Alisports looked towards expanding its e-commerce offerings and move towards a “new retail” model.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move to a new retail business model is in line with Alibaba's overall strategy. The term “new retail” was first coined by its founder Jack Ma, and the e-commerce giant has since invested in a string of offline retail companies as it looks to better integrate online and offline shopping to provide a better retail experience for consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alisports was established in 2015, with its operations encompassing television and digital sports rights, as well as venue commercialisation and sports event organisation. Over the last two years, Alisports organised the annual World Electronic Sports Games, a global electronic sports tournament with a multimillion dollar prize pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese internet companies Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, as well as LeEco, also operate their own sports arms, primarily to obtain exclusive streaming rights to sporting events as they look to carve out a slice of the growing subscription-based entertainment market in China. Given the large number of football and basketball fans in China, sports streaming services can be especially lucrative.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Tencent announced a deal to stream the US Major League Baseball games to viewers in China.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed company Grandshores Technology Group, a blockchain investor tied to a 10 billion yuan (US$1.46 billion) global blockchain fund backed by the government of China's Hangzhou municipality, said late on Monday it had appointed China's “bitcoin evangelist”, Li Xiaolai, as its co-chief executive and executive director.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said in a stock exchange announcement that Li, known for founding Bitfund, a bitcoin-focused venture capital fund in China that at its peak had 3.8 billion yuan in assets under management, will lead various projects at Grandshores. One of these will be a “stablecoin” pegged to the yen. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, such as gold or a hard currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mr Li will mainly be responsible for various projects in which the company is taking part, including the establishment of a stable digital currency system (focusing on mainstream international currencies),” the company said in its announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores is aiming to launch the yen stablecoin by February 2019, sources close to the company said on Tuesday. Its chairman, Yao Yongjie, has previously said it would also explore stablecoins pegged to the Hong Kong and Australian dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, there is a growing demand within the cryptocurrency community for stablecoins, which are being used for the settlement of cryptocurrency-denominated trades. Traders prefer stablecoins to fiat currencies because of their faster settlement time. Stablecoins are also often viewed as providing price stability, especially during periods of cryptocurrency market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, 46, an English-language teacher before his career in bitcoin and blockchain start-up investment, graduated from Changchun University with a degree in industrial enterprise accounting. His other blockchain investment vehicle is INBlockchain, which has invested in leading blockchain projects such as EOS.IO, an open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralised blockchain applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li's term is unspecified and he will hold office at least up until the company's next annual general meeting, expected in August 2019. In its exchange announcement, Grandshores also said his pay will be determined by its remuneration committee and board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, Hurun, the Shanghai-based publishing group that compiles the lists of China's wealthiest individuals, estimated Li's net worth at 7 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores has been positioned as an international launch pad for the Hangzhou Grandshores Fund. It is expected to help the backers of its affiliated mainland fund invest globally into blockchain start-ups with the potential of becoming the next blockchain unicorn, or private company valued at more than US$1 billion. Li is also one of the founders of the Hangzhou Grandshores Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's other co-CEO is Wang Qian, 30, formerly a fund manager with Grey Investment in Hong Kong. Shares in Grandshores closed 22.6 per cent higher at HK$1.25 on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao and Li could not be immediately reached for comment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/11/11/c66ca10c-883c-11e5-9598-b94cb5b90839_image_hires.jpg?itok=KZ90u189]</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no small talk in the country, so there is no guessing [among colleagues and partners] when we do business," said Paananen, who began his career in computer gaming right after graduation.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a "great work culture" bolsters efficiency and helps Finnish entrepreneurs and their teammates quickly turn their businesses into a success, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He made a point of comparing this to the high level of bureaucracy that can often tie up companies elsewhere in Europe and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Finland is a very small country ... so in many cases we know everybody [in a company] and there is less management needed, so we can be very efficient," she said earlier this week.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SLUSH, Europe's biggest start-up conference, is taking place in the Finnish capital this week with the support of the country's foreign ministry and other government agencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other factors that have made the country stand out in recent years include a strong reservoir of technology talents, including many experienced programmers and engineers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also praised Finland's education system for helping shore up and attract talent. It has been ranked as "the world's best" by the well-respected education industry standard Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is backed by the </span><span class="s3">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</span><span class="s1">?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paananen noted that after Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia in mid-2013[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1302434/microsoft-acquire-nokias-handset-business-hk557b], many former </span><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> employees, including many outstanding </span><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> developers, went on to start their own businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> used to ranks as the world' s largest mobile phone maker before it was superseded by Apple when the latter's iPhone redefined the industry landscape.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> may no longer be considered the biggest source of Finland's national pride, but many former staffers are now key drivers behind local start-ups and industry innovation in new business areas. Some have been by Paananen to work on new projects at Supercell.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-ups have taken off around the world in recent years and especially in China, with homegrown companies like car-hailing app </span><span class="s3">Didi Kuaidi</span><span class="s1"> valued at US$16 billion and drone maker DJI, which controls over 70 per cent of the global marker for civilian drones, now worth at least US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the Chinese mainland ranks as the world's No.2 economy and the world's largest and fastest-growing internet market, Hong Kong is also keen to play a leading role in new technological advances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After years of delay, the city's new Innovation and Technology Bureau[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1877615/hong-kongs-new-innovation-and-technology-bureau-absorb-two] was approved last week by local legislators. Part of its aim is to help Hong Kong, which for decades has been known as one of the world's leading financial hubs, transform its economic structure by growing more start-ups with the aim of churning out so-called "unicorn" enterprises valued at US$1 billion or higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paananen, also one of the richest young business leaders in Europe, chose not to directly compare Finland with other countries in terms of their respective business environments for start-ups. But he noted how the strong English-speaking environment and high standard of living in the Nordic welfare state have also helped drive the success of new companies.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adopting a new mindset is also important, he said, as more Finnish people now have very different views on new businesses like mobile gaming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I graduated and began my first job in the mobile game business, many people would still ask me when I can find a ‘real job'," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Now that's certainly changing," he added, noting the game business has already become one of the major tax contributors bolstering Finland's economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Advanced manufacturing and smart transport are two one-time traditional industries that have been transformed by technological advances, for which Asia has become the global hub. Real estate could be next. For the first time in over a century, the way we build, buy and manage property is changing in response to new technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And while the "proptech” sector emerged in recent years in Western markets on the strength of new technology, the next chapter in the transformation of construction and property management is likely to take place in Asia - if it succeeds in leveraging cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced materials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proptech, or property technology, came to the fore as a major technology sector last year. Proptech companies raised US$12.6 billion last year, a 200 per cent increase from 2016. WeWork and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> became two of the three most valuable start-ups in the United States. A dozen more proptech companies also passed the billion-dollar valuation threshold to achieve unicorn status.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the investors behind these companies ranged from blue-chip funds like </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Ford Foundation</span><span class="s1"> to some of the world's largest landlords and commercial brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US proptech fund Fifth Wall attracts Hong Kong, Asian interest[https://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2159126/us-proptech-fund-fifth-wall-attracts-strong-interest-hk]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rush of activity, however, was largely limited by technology and geography. Existing technologies like shared economy solutions and listing platforms dominated the funded companies. Little capital was deployed to start-ups driven by more sophisticated digital technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, the capital was focused in Western markets, with companies in the US and UK representing more than 70 per cent of deal activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How proptech is changing Hong Kong's property industry[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145546/how-proptech-changing-hong-kongs-property-industry]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both these limitations are now disappearing. The money in proptech is attracting the best technology. New start-ups are increasingly founded by software and engineering PhDs rather than exclusively real estate veterans. And technology ecosystems like Israel now boast vibrant proptech sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given the global nature of property markets, we expect real estate centres in New York, London and increasingly Dubai, Hong Kong and Shanghai to link with technology hubs like Israel to create future unicorns. This trend is already under way, as some of proptech's most innovative companies - WeWork, Compass, Selina - were founded in international property markets by Israeli entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second missing ingredient in proptech - Asian markets - is also now coming into play. Investors and property groups in Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China and the Gulf have been moving quickly in recent months to stimulate the local proptech ecosystems. The global real estate broker JLL opened offices in Hong Kong for a dedicated proptech fund and in Singapore, JLL partnered with Lendlease to open the region's first proptech accelerator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore construction conglomerate Woh Hup assigned its investment subsidiary Aurum to focus on proptech opportunities. Venture capital funds dedicated to proptech are arriving in Hong Kong and Beijing[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145546/how-proptech-changing-hong-kongs-property-industry]. These firms may be joined soon by Asia's leading sovereign wealth funds. </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</span><span class="s1"> are reportedly considering following the example set by Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund, which invested heavily in SoftBank's proptech-driven Vision Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will a Saudi scandal cloud SoftBank's US$100 billion grand vision?[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2169321/will-saudi-arabias-unfolding-scandal-cloud-us100-billion-vision-softbanks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Asian proptech investors may have looked to the West for inspiration, the market for the new technologies is in their backyard. The scale of Asia's construction output is outpacing the entire construction output of the US and Europe. The importance of regional infrastructure expansion is headlined by ambitious government policies such as China's Belt and Road Initiative[https://www.scmp.com/topics/belt-and-road-initiative]. Moreover, Asian building regulations are generally far less onerous than Western standards - and yet more receptive to futuristic technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While "smart city” is often treated as a buzzword in Western markets, in Asia the term serves as a blueprint for projects as far afield as the futuristic planned city of Neom in Saudi Arabia and the Smart Nation urban planning programme in Singapore. For proptech, this provides an unparalleled entry point to grow on the back of Asia's accelerating and tech-friendly construction boom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When proptech emerged in 2016, the excitement was in the opportunity to disrupt an industry that was among the last to embrace technology. But the real revolution in proptech will take place when today's most advanced technologies are applied to construction and real estate in the fast-growing and technology-friendly markets in Asia and the Gulf. That revolution is now under way.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jia Qinglin , head of Beijing's top political advisory body, will attend the 18th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa to inaugurate the union's new headquarters. Jia will be the most senior official from Beijing to attend the summit. The building, which reportedly cost US$200 million, was entirely funded by the Chinese government and is the tallest building in the Ethiopian capital. The Foreign Ministry said Jia would also hold talks with Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the president of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and current holder of the union's rotating presidency.</span></p>

Lee said the union had heard some employees were planning the protest but did not know how many. Late last year the bank, which employs about 30,000 people, said it would axe about 10 per cent of its local workforce by the end of 2013.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta is expected to outline a 5 per cent cut in the defence budget - the first since the attacks of September 11, 2001. The details will not be formally released until President Barack Obama unveils his budget next month, but some details have begun to emerge. Officials say the cuts will end the US Air Force's long-range surveillance drone known as the Global Hawk, but keep the US Navy's version of the unmanned aircraft.

The attack prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy to halt training programmes for the Afghan military and threaten to pull French forces out of Afghanistan earlier than planned.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a hot summer's day in the hip district of Kreuzberg in Berlin, 28-year-old Simon Specka is closeted indoors with his team of 40 staff members facing an array of computer screens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huddled in an office in a century-old industrial building with neither air-conditioning nor an electric fan, they are trying to create the next-generation of internet security software. They make no attempt to wipe away the sweat soaking their sideburns. Their damp shirts clinging to their backs do not seem to bother them either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want to make an impact on the world," says Specka, who three years ago co-founded ZenGuard, the Berlin-based tech start-up behind ZenMate, a software encrypting internet users' connection information and transmitted data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The software has bagged over 13 million users around the world in just three years. In Asia, nearly 200,000 have subscribed to the software that generates a virtual private network to keep secret who an individual is communicating with and information contained in the message.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Creating a better world, a vision for the future is our driving force," says Specka.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His motto is also a mantra resounding across the vibrant tech start-up scene in the German capital that has been dubbed Europe's "Silicon Alley" - one of the continent's hottest tech start-up hubs being billed as on its way to being the next Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Berlin might have been scarred by the history of a divided Germany. But today, a quarter of a century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it has become a creative Mecca drawing young entrepreneurs, artists and tech savvy talents from all over the world to realise their start-up dreams.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The German capital is home to some of the world's best-known start-ups such as online audio distribution platform </span><span class="s3">SoundCloud</span><span class="s1">, which was founded by a Swedish team.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The buzz in Berlin has caught the attention of venture capitalists and investors worldwide, including those from Hong Kong and the mainland. In April this year, Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures struck a six-digit-euro deal with Berlin-based start-up Jobspotting. On July 13, a delegation of 30 Chinese family business owners and investors looking for investment opportunities attended an event in Berlin to hear business pitches from tech start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traditional German corporations such as </span><span class="s3">Lufthansa</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Volkswagen</span><span class="s1"> are tapping into youngsters' minds for business inspiration by sponsoring events such as hackathons. </span><span class="s3">Lufthansa</span><span class="s1"> also recently established the "</span><span class="s3">Lufthansa</span><span class="s1"> Innovation Hub" in Berlin to scout for and build start-ups and digital companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/2015/07/23/26061964ce104c3f5a7c4beb75e83c4e.jpg]Official statistics show that investment in Berlin tech start-ups rose from €123.4 million (HK$1 billion) in 2012 to €136.2 million euros in 2013 - three times more than the €45.7 million invested in Bavaria, Germany's largest state that ranked second in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When Germany was still separated, Berlin was economically isolated. West Berlin had little space for manufacturing activities. East Berlin, on the other hand, was full of broken infrastructure," says Alex Jansen, a Berlin-based consultant for start-ups including ZenGuard and </span><span class="s3">Native Instruments</span><span class="s1">, the developer of hardware and software for music production used by top bands such as Kraftwerk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jansen says after reunification, more cheap spaces opened up for artists and creative talents who were already settling in the former West Berlin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Low rent became a comparative advantage for Berlin in transforming itself into a hub for artists and new businesses to try their innovative ideas at a low cost, says Jansen. According to data aggregator Numbeo, consumer prices in Berlin are 35 per cent lower than in London. And rent in Berlin is 72 per cent lower than in the British capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a conducive environment has helped to fire up the creative scene, says Jansen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One example is the three Samwer brothers, who in 2007 founded </span><span class="s3">Rocket Internet</span><span class="s1">. The internet company, though criticised for cloning successful business models from abroad, floated on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange last year and had a market capitalisation of €5.91 billion as of mid-July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Berlin start-up scene is supported by a thriving ecosystem. Jansen says that while the federal government offers various funding schemes to young entrepreneurs as seed money, the private sector also offers loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some big companies also take on the role of accelerator. One of them is media giant </span><span class="s3">Axel Springer</span><span class="s1">'s Plug and Play Accelerator, offering start-ups an incubation programme, funding and global networking opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It all looks promising on paper. But according to insiders, there's still a long way to go before Berlin start-ups go truly global and become unicorns - companies that boast a valuation of US$1 billion or above. According to Fortune's The Unicorn List, online food ordering service </span><span class="s3">Delivery Hero</span><span class="s1"> is the only Berlin-based start-up on the list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maks Giordano, managing partner and co-founder of creative strategist Kreait, says that while Berlin has the right environment for start-ups, it still lags far behind Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The business-cloning culture in Berlin, he says, makes it even harder to generate unique and original business ideas that can rival the big guns in the US. "Most innovation still resides in the US," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a global ranking last year of cities with the most tech start-ups set up in the past decade that had gone global or received huge investments, California's Silicon Valley was top with 201 start-ups, followed by New York with 144 and London with 90.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Berlin had 27, ahead of Bangalore, India (26) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (21).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expanding overseas has yet to be top of the agenda for many Berlin start-ups, Giordano says. Many are too busy focusing on making it big in Germany, which is quite a big market, he says. "They need to make the German market work first before going international," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, those with ambition recognise the need to go global, and exploiting the massive potential of China's market remains one of the ultimate goals. But there are huge obstacles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"People are very cautious," says Giordano, citing cultural differences and language barriers among the many problems. The protection of intellectual property is the crux of the issue. Stories of mainland Chinese factories ripping off foreign designs and making local versions of their own are often heard in the business world, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Hong Kong and the mainland offer Berlin start-ups major opportunities for fund-raising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Funds from mainland China and Hong Kong are looking outwards," says Holger Weiss, CEO of Berlin-based start-up Aupeo! He adds that he has met managers of Chinese funds that were keen on finding out more about Berlin start-ups. "They are looking for another unicorn," he says</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jansen says while the mainland remains "interesting" to many start-ups, many of them have no idea how to approach the market. "Market intelligence services would be necessary for start-ups hoping to go to China," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Specka says his company's service was previously available to mainland users. But about a year and a half ago, ZenMate was blocked by Beijing, and the company has yet to identify a solution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Specka is not giving up just yet. "There are plenty of serious venture capitalists in Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong might be very expensive to operate a business but you can make money much faster there," he says.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anthony Tan knew it was not going to be your usual business meeting when the taxi fleet boss he had arranged to meet in the Philippines entered the restaurant surrounded by burly bodyguards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I remember thinking, Manila is hot, why is everyone wearing a jacket and sunglasses at night? What is going on?” said Tan, co-founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia's most valuable tech start-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan was there to sign up the taxi-fleet owner to his ride-booking app. Midway through the negotiations, there was a loud thud. He peered under their table and saw what looked like a machine gun on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I was like, holy cow, I guess this negotiation is going in your favour!” It was only later that Tan realised he had just sat across the table from one of the area's biggest arms dealers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan laughed as he recounted the early days of Grab to the South China Morning Post at its swanky new headquarters at Marina One West in Singapore's downtown business district. Occupying two floors with expansive views of the busy Tanjong Pagar port, both Grab's new digs and Tan's anecdote underscore how far the start-up he founded with fellow Harvard MBA classmate Tan Hooi Ling [no relation] has come from its beginnings in a cramped garage in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since its inception almost six years ago Grab has fought off no-holds barred competitors such as US-based Uber to lead the region's ride-hailing market. Grab has morphed into Southeast Asia's most valuable tech start-up with a valuation of over US$10 billion, giving Tan a personal fortune of around US$300 million, according to a Forbes estimate made before the latest fundraising round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ctrip's female CEO on gender inequality and fighting internet platform companies[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2156661/ctrips-female-ceo-gender-inequality-and-fighting-internet-platform]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia, with its population of about 660 million, has long been seen as the next big market for tech companies - the ride-hailing business alone is forecast to be worth more than US$20 billion by 2025, according to a report on Southeast Asia's internet economy released by </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1"> in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, Grab operates in 225 cities across eight countries and boasts over 100 million app downloads. What started out as a taxi-booking app to help keep both drivers and riders safe has evolved to include bookings for private cars, bicycles, shuttle buses and now delivery services for food, parcels and groceries. To tie all of its services together, it also launched mobile payments service GrabPay in 2016, making payments for services more convenient and incentivising users to make in-store purchases in exchange for reward points. The company is expected to generate US$1 billion in revenue for 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dressed in a black polo T-shirt and charcoal slacks, Tan has a warm, approachable manner and his speech is peppered with colloquialisms common to Singapore and Malaysia. But Tan's down-to-earth manner belies his well-heeled background - before founding Grab, the 36-year-old was better known as a scion of a prominent Malaysian family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Singapore, a preview of the clash to come between Grab and Go-Jek[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2149640/singapore-preview-how-grab-and-go-jek-will-likely-face-across-southeast-asia]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I first met Anthony at a [Harvard] business school event. He was super well-dressed, very extroverted and knew all the right people in the room,” said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anthony Tan is the youngest of three brothers born to Tan Heng Chew, president of Tan Chong Motor, which assembles and distributes </span><span class="s3">Nissan</span><span class="s1"> cars across Southeast Asia. His father believed in the school of “tough love” though and so the younger Tan was put to work on an assembly line and accompanied his father to meetings with tough union bosses, which opened his eyes to a different world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At first I had the typical preconception [of him as a rich man's son],” said Hooi Ling. “But when I got to know him, I was super impressed with Anthony's work ethic. He is one of the most hardworking individuals I have ever met … despite the natural advantages he has from his family.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foo Jixun, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV, which led Grab's US$15 million Series B round of financing, said he found Tan's passion interesting, especially since he was born with the proverbial “silver spoon in his mouth” and did not necessarily have to prove anything.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The idea for Grab (originally known as </span><span class="s3">MyTeksi</span><span class="s1">) was conceived when the two Tans happened to sit next to each other during an MBA class. While ride-hailing companies at the time, such as Uber and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, focused on providing better matching of supply and demand for rides, Anthony and Hooi Ling had a different starting point - improving safety.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The safety of Malaysia's taxi industry at the time left much to be desired. There were some bad eggs among the taxi drivers, and it was giving the entire industry a bad reputation. “Hooi Ling experienced the pain for herself. When she was a consultant at McKinsey she'd finish work late at night and would have to pretend to be on the phone with her mother [while in the taxi as a safety precaution],” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Armed with an innate understanding of some of the dangers of single travel in the region, Grab allowed passengers to share the progress of their rides, in real-time, with someone else as a safety precaution. Soon after, it followed in Uber's footsteps by including number masking between drivers and passengers to protect user privacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, in a major broadening of its business, Grab announced that it would be opening its platform to third-party service providers as part of a push to build an everyday app that can provide a wide array of services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab to open on-demand services platform to third-party providers[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2152176/grab-include-third-party-providers-quest-build-everyday-app]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To find partners for its open platform, Grab has started a venture capital arm, and intends to beef up its financial services offerings to serve the underbanked in Southeast Asia. It has even moved into artificial intelligence, partnering with the </span><span class="s3">National University of Singapore</span><span class="s1"> to analyse user data and explore ways of improving mobility across the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, Grab has a list of shareholders that reads like a 'who's who' in the on-demand services industry and Tan can tap business leaders including </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Corp</span><span class="s1">.'s Masayoshi Son, Cheng Wei of China ride-hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi for advice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/28/33e596f8-9177-11e8-9656-94877fce2da3_image_hires_095200.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan recently went to Japan to meet with Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, which invested US$1 billion in the start-up. His early venture capital backers include San Francisco-based 500 Startups and Singapore's </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1">-owned </span><span class="s3">Vertex Ventures</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But none of it could have been possible without one particular investor - Anthony Tan's mother, Khor Swee Wah. Tan, who had worked as a marketing director for Tan Chong Motor before starting Grab, first brought the idea for the taxi-booking app to his father, who dismissed it and urged him to stay in the family business. His mother, wanting to be supportive, put in ‘several millions' to help Tan get things off the ground and accompanied him to investor meetings in the early days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a rock star list of investors behind him and a green field of opportunity ahead, things have “gained traction” says Tan, being careful not to use the word success. “What is success? There's no end point. We will always find ways to disrupt ourselves,” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not everything has been plain sailing though and he is momentarily stumped when asked about challenges. “Every day is a challenge,” he says, glancing at his PR team across the room.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What he doesn't mention, until asked, is the recent dressing down Grab received from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, which accused the company of reducing competition after it took over Uber's Southeast Asian operations in a merger deal in March. “There's plenty of competition and we will make our representations known to the commission,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There's also the spectre of increased rivalry with Indonesia's Go-Jek, helmed by fellow Harvard MBA classmate Nadiem Makarim and which has set out ambitious plans to expand outside its home market, setting it on a collision course with Grab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek steps up rivalry with Grab as it expands in Southeast Asia[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2152604/indonesias-go-jek-sees-lot-experimentation-it-expands-fight-grab]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two companies are in a battle for investors as well as customers - Grab and Go-Jek count Chinese tech unicorns </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Meituan-Dianping</span><span class="s1"> as investors respectively. Go-Jek's latest funding round values it at about US$5 billion. At the mention of Go-Jek, Tan trots out an oft-used line: “We welcome and embrace competition, because it's easy to re-anchor ourselves on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan and Makarim met at Harvard and were once close - Tan is said to have considered taking an early stake in Go-Jek when Makarim founded the business in Indonesia. But the two drifted apart as it became apparent that they would become competitors. The companies now seldom send executives to attend a conference or forum if the other party is present.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Until recently, Go-Jek operated only in its home market Indonesia, but has since announced plans to launch units in Thailand and Vietnam. Although the company is in fewer markets than Grab, Go-Jek offers more services, making it an interesting test case of whether it is wiser to build the platform suite of services before venturing into different markets, or to gain a foothold in different markets first before tackling more services. Go-Jek said this year that it has earmarked US$500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its competition with Grab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Grab, like other start-ups that have reached a certain stage of development, is to decide on how to maintain initial growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Every big start-up, from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, Tencent to Alibaba, considers whether to build, buy, partner, or invest as it grows its footprint - and getting that right can be quite a journey,” said Khailee Ng, partner at 500 Startups, which made an early-stage investment in Grab in 2014. “This is the current phase Grab is in.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">True dominance of China's Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent revealed - and how their influence extends worldwide[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2154437/true-dominance-chinas-baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-revealed-and-how]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Managing an aspirant multinational company also requires different skills from running a scrappy start-up. This contrasts with the early days when everyone would “know when someone goes to the toilet because we were all sitting at one table, just the few of us,” says Tan. Grab now has 5,000 staff across the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When hiring, Tan says Grab looks for people with four attributes that the company has codified into guiding principles, namely: Hunger, Humility, Honesty and Heart. “We have made bad hires and learned from it,” said co-founder Tan Hooi Ling in a recent interview in Hong Kong. “We don't want to hire brilliant jerks.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many business founders, Tan has had to make the hard decisions to bring in more experienced, external talent when needed, placing them above some of the people who he started out with, says Chua Joo Hock, managing partner of </span><span class="s3">Vertex Ventures</span><span class="s1">, which invested in Grab in April 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab's ‘pay it forward' moment takes a page from mentor Softbank[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2149306/grabs-co-founder-launches-venture-capital-arm-help-start-ups-avoid]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many start-up founders aren't able to make that step up, but Anthony has and that's credit to him,” said Chua. “He's very down-to-earth and truly wants to help people in the lower strata and is one of the rare founders in this part of the world who really understands the problems faced and can rally people to [believe in his vision].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These days, both co-founders spend most of their time on the road. Anthony Tan frequently visits Indonesia, a vast archipelagic nation with around 260 million potential consumers, recently stopping by 18 shopping malls in one day to check out the adoption of GrabPay, the company's mobile payments wallet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/28/340d757e-9177-11e8-9656-94877fce2da3_image_hires_095200.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anthony Tan said that his personal faith, as a Christian, guides his actions and also how the company operates. A principle such as servant leadership is a core influence at the company. “If Jesus can wash his disciples' feet, then who am I?” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab has been aggressive when dealing with rivals though.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First there was EasyTaxi backed by </span><span class="s3">Rocket Internet</span><span class="s1">, then there was global leader Uber, whose founder Travis Kalanick took its bruising approach to markets outside the US. Like Grab's shareholder </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, the company was able to fight Uber to a standstill until it had a change of direction under new CEO Khosrowshahi. Grab took over Uber's Southeast Asian operations earlier in March, after the two companies reached an agreement to stop bleeding money in a subsidy war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Up until this point Grab had cultivated a good relationship with regulators, maintaining regular communications and striving to demonstrate how its presence in a market can be beneficial for society. Grab has also tailored its products to suit local markets. However, Singapore's competition watchdog is now examining Grab's dominance, noting a sharp reduction in the incentives customers and drivers used to receive when there was fierce competition between Uber and Grab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore threatens to reverse Uber and Grab Southeast Asia deal[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2153958/singapore-threatens-reverse-ubers-sale-southeast-asian-operations]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One Grab private-car driver of around four years the Post spoke to said he used to be able to get S$1,000 (US$735) in driver incentives per month but now that had shrunk to about S$200 with more strings attached. Still, he admitted that he owed his job to ride-hailing apps like Grab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today Tan and Hooi Ling are feted by the tech industry and media. Both were included in Fortune's 40 Under 40 2018 list of the most influential young people in business, while Anthony also made it to Fast Company's 100 Most Creative People in Business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All this seems a long way from the Kuala Lumpur garage where it all began. Tan recalls knocking on taxi windows to convince drivers who brought in their cars for repairs to download Grab's early app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Uncle give us a chance lah, your income is sure to increase!” Tan recalls saying. “We were basically begging,” he says. “Maybe out of 10 drivers I pitched, two would agree to try it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the interview draws to a close, we ask Tan what his exit strategy is. “There is none. I'm all in,” he says. “This is all I know. I was born in Southeast Asia, this is my home. I will live and die here.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For more than 100 years, during the fourth month of the lunar calendar, residents of Cheung Chau have honoured the god Pak Tai to appease the wandering spirits of plague victims who died during the Qing dynasty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The island's residents ate vegetarian food and lit incense at the intricate Pak Tai Temple. Local men built three towers of steamed buns for a climbing competition while children, dressed as legendary heroes, were suspended on steel frames and appeared to float above the crowd's heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fixing the Cheung Chau bun festival in May on Buddha's birthdate and resuming the bun competition in 2005 after it had been halted for safety reasons have helped lure 40,000 visitors annually to the island. That's made the Cheung Chau bun festival one of Hong Kong's great cultural treasures that the city hopes to preserve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the popularity of the three-day carnival, which nearly doubles the population of the 2.46 sq km island each year, has also turned off natives such as Lai Tai-sing and his wife, Chan Kam-mui. During the festivities, they stay locked inside their public housing apartment, finding the event irrelevant.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's true that tourists make the island more vibrant and bring business to local shops," said the 49-year-old Lai. "The festival has little to do with us now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, the annual event joined China's national list of intangible cultural heritage - artefacts that include performing arts, skills, rituals, crafts and festivals, and that differ from physical heritage items such as buildings and possessions. Inclusion on the list wins national and possibly worldwide recognition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Safeguarding such traditions has become a global fashion, thanks to the advocacy of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (</span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">). Hong Kong got swept up in the trend, embarking in 2009 on a four-year survey of the city's cultural traditions. The result was the city's first inventory of intangible cultural heritage published in June, cataloguing 480 entries in hopes of keeping traditions alive, said Liu Tik-sang, director of the University of Science and Technology's South China Research Centre, which conducted the survey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is a dilemma. To sustain cultural heritage that's at risk of disappearing, cash and resources are needed. Promotions help bring visitors and money. But overexposure can commercialise a tradition, turning it into tourism spectacle and severing its ties to the local community.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Community life and the community's sense of belonging are most important to intangible cultural heritage," said Liu, a cultural anthropologist. "But when a tradition becomes a show for tourists, it is taken out of context and loses its original meaning to the community."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is a treasure island of Chinese tradition. Civil wars, the second world war and the cultural revolution destroyed swathes of important customs over the last century, Liu said. After Chinese fled to Hong Kong, such traditions thrived and were preserved under colonial rule.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> lists 327 intangible cultural heritage items - from Albanian iso-polyphony music to Zimbabwe's Mbende Jerusarema dance. Thirty-eight traditions from China made the worldwide list, including those that thrive in Hong Kong: Cantonese opera, acupuncture and moxibustion, or heat application, used in traditional Chinese medicine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 1982 </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> conference vowed to protect all forms of cultural items, especially in communities affected by colonialism, war and globalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worldwide recognition of a song or a craft brings prestige to a local community, Liu said. The item's mention raises people's awareness, which can, of course, become a form of promotion and drive preservation efforts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To reach the global list, a tradition such as the Cheung Chau bun festival must manoeuvre a bureaucratic route.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong began asking the public in 2006 to nominate traditions worth preserving. The 480 items correspond to the </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> guidelines. Released in June, the list includes Hakka Chinese and Cantonese, as well as techniques for making pineapple buns, shrimp paste and Hong Kong "silk stocking" milk tea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To get on the national list, an item must be nominated by the provincial or SAR government, which then submits it to the Ministry of Culture for vetting based on cultural and historical values and urgency for preservation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The national recognition is important. For a Hong Kong tradition to get </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> recognition, it must appear on the national list, as </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> accepts Chinese submissions only from Beijing. The national list also includes the Tai Hang fire dragon dance, the Tai O dragon boat water parade, and the Yu Lan ghost festival of the city's Chiu Chow community.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government submitted four other items to Beijing last year - the Quanzhen temples' Taoist ritual music; Wong Tai Sin belief and customs; the crafting of guqin, a seven-stringed plucked instrument; and the Hakka unicorn dance in Hang Hau. A decision on these has yet to be announced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Items from the city's inventory - to be listed online by the year's end - will be reviewed, said Florence Hui Hiu-fai, the city's undersecretary for home affairs, for future submissions. After the Hong Kong list is firm, the proposals to Beijing will come from there. It's not certain how many items will be chosen, Hui said, but those that have high cultural value and that face endangerment will receive priority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benefits of getting national or international recognition can be immense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heritage sites and items lure money. The traditional dress of cheongsam - a figure-hugging outfit with a stiff collar - has inspired contemporary designers, drawing interest from youth. Food items such as egg tarts and cha kwo, or steamed sticky rice dumpling, introduce people to Hong Kong heritage, Hui said. Cultural tours that take visitors past heritage sites attract tourists.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And such items can lure much-needed philanthropy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong provides no designated funding for most intangible heritage preservation. Cantonese opera, which is on </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">'s list, is an exception. The government's Cantonese Opera Development Fund, started in 2005, channelled HK$9.8 million into 57 programmes in fiscal year 2013-14. The Lord Wilson Heritage Trust, founded by the government in 1992, subsidised 157 community projects at HK$41.6 million as of March last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2012-13, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Jockey Club</span><span class="s1"> Charitable Trust financed a study project with HK$359,000 of the Yu Lan ghost festival in the Chiu Chow community and paid HK$354,000 to help put on last year's Cheung Chau bun festival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the growth of creative industries and cultural tourism can lead to commercialisation, which worries proponents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said practices and rituals are performed to connect people with a community - for a community - not outsiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's promotion should be respectful, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, fishermen's laments traditionally sung for families at weddings and funerals to honour dead relatives should not become paid shows for tourists as that would be disrespectful, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government's effort to catalogue these perhaps fading traditions is important, he said. The elderly practitioners are dying, and younger generations of indigenous inhabitants have left their rural homes, severing their roots to attend elite schools and find well-paying jobs in the city centre. "If you can't sustain the local economy, you can't sustain [the heritage]," Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Resources, he said, should be given to local communities - either money or priority land use - so that the residents can carry on the traditions, rather than transforming their heritage into a tourism spectacle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Cheung Chau, tourists and the money they spend are vital for the dumbbell-shaped island. "Cheung Chau needs money," said Yung Chi-ming, a life-long resident of the island and chairman of the Bun Festival organising committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yung, who also chairs the island's Rural Committee, said that each festival costs more than HK$1 million to stage and fund-raising has been difficult in years past. He said the local economy soured in the early 2000s and few people visited Cheung Chau. "People moaned about the bad business," Yung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the bun festival's success in bringing tens of thousands of tourists has benefited the island's small local businesses, Yung said. National heritage recognition also made fundraising easier, he added. He said there were island natives who chose not to take part or come back to Cheung Chau for the festival, but there were others who are dedicated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The downside is that people now complain about the island being overcrowded with tourists," said Yung. "It's very difficult to find a balance."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the bun festival gets listed with </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">, it would become part of the world's cultural heritage, said Chau Hing-wah, curator of the </span><span class="s3">Heritage Museum</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu, Chau and others insisted that safeguarding intangible cultural heritage was not about promoting tourism or creating other money-making opportunities. The truth is, Chau says, that many visitors are not aware of the real customs of the Cheung Chau festival besides the most eye-catching parades and lucky bun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is a dilemma. I certainly do not want to see the festival become too commercial. If [cultural heritage] serves tourists only, it is wrong," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cultural critic and consultant Desmond Hui said: "Intangible cultural heritage carries intrinsic value that is important to a society's identity and knowledge."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Preserving such traditions helps to safeguard Hong Kong's identity amid a growing mainland influence, experts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yung said the Cheung Chau bun festival must go on - despite criticisms. The festival celebrates an identity that is unique in Hong Kong. He hoped more natives would return home. "It is our island's heritage that we are proud of," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The South China Morning Post will highlight some of the city's intangible cultural heritage in coming weeks</span></p>
