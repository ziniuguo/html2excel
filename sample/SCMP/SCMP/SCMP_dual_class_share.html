<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies chairman, Francis Leung Pak-to, also known as “father of red chips” said on Monday that the chamber supported the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed separate board to list dual class share companies here, but not new start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has just ended a consultation last Friday for the third board's establishment, whose listing requirements differ from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, essentially aimed at providing a listing venue for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two platforms: a premium market that is open to all investors and will host companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but have a dual-class share structure which the exchange currently disallows. The second is for start-ups where only professional investors can invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung was opposed to the start-up board for the high risks that entailed. “Many start-ups lack track records and have a high risk of failure. They are not suitable to be traded on the stock exchange,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He supported however, the launch of a separate board only for the dual class shares with a market capitalisation of HK$8 billion, which is similar to a so-called unicorn new economy firm valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list here,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are plenty of mainland “unicorns” which would be interested to list in Hong Kong, but our market needs to prepare itself for these companies. This is why we would need this new board that accept dual class share companies to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many big technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are dual class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than the others. Hong Kong bans such types of companies to list but US allows it, which has led mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to go for a listing in New York in 2014, instead of Hong Kong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list hereFrancis Leung Pak-to, Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Three years after losing Alibaba and our market still has done nothing to address the issue. We need to make sure our market can capture these companies to list. This is why we need to introduce the third board soon,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I introduced the red chips in Hong Kong in the 1990s, there were many criticisms that these companies are different from other H-shares. But then, we have many successful listings - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Citic, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> - and they are still heavily traded by investors,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A red chip is a company incorporated in Hong Kong but has a mainland parent, which is different from an H-share company which is established in the mainland but listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also against the HKEX's proposal to let US-listed mainland companies seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This rule will turn Hong Kong into a second-tier market as most big players will go list in the US and then seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. We oppose to this proposal,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> has opposed to dual class share listings as they reduce the ability for fund managers to exercise their voting rights to decide on the remuneration, director appointments and other important corporate affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund body said the development of dual class shares were “negative” to investor protection and urged the exchange to stick to “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) busies itself consulting on detailed trading rule changes, to pave the likely way for companies seeking dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, it's time to outline exactly what their inclusion in the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index would mean.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a proposal by HKEX, a one-month consultation period ends on March 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its plan is to attract three categories of new-economy companies to list here: large biotech companies without revenue, giant dual-class shareholding structured new economies companies, and US-listed mainland new-economy companies looking for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting right over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are popular among many tech firms such as US tech firm </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, and pointedly mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns South China Morning Post. The fact Hong Kong could not then offer Alibaba a dual-class structure was seen as a strong reason why the tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With several “unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion) expected to seek public funding in the not-too-distant future, such as Xiaomi, WeLab, Lufax, and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">, officials in Hong Kong are anxious not to have a repeat of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX expects to start accepting dual-class applications, soon after the end of the consultation's conclusion in late April, with the first dual-class share companies floating in the city as early as June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we still don't know whether or when successful dual-listed companies will eventually be allowed to be included in the benchmark Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's important, as many passive fund managers track the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index. If such companies were be added to these indexes, they could be accessed by a much larger pool of institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there are the Stock Connect share trading links between the Hong Kong exchange and its peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen to consider, which only allow the trading of stocks listed on the major Hang Seng Indexes (again, the Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index) to qualify, and in which mainlanders and mainland mutual funds have readily invested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong exchange's turnover comes via southbound trading over the Stock Connect links.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So if these stocks are not allowed to be included in the major indexes, mainlanders would unable to buy them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Indexes Company, which compiles the benchmark indices, completed its own public consultation on the issue, ending On February 28 - but it's still yet to publish its conclusions nearly a fortnight on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants themselves, say they still have mixed views on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers, supports the inclusion of dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index, giving a green light to mainlanders to plough into them via Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many passive fund managers, however, oppose the suggestion, as once dual-class shares are included in the leading Hang Seng indexes, they fear they would have no choice but to focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other fund managers express reservations on the dual-class structure as it violate the city's “one-share, one vote” rule - an important principle for listed companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, New York's S&amp;P and London's FTSE indexed have not included these companies in some of their indexes, as in some cases they add restrictions on calculating their weighting on a gauge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSCI, another major index complier, is also consulting the market on their inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland exchanges consider allowing them, we are going to see more of these companies listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any blanket ban on them appearing in major indexes would be unlikely - but we are likely to see some restrictions coming with such issuances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many sector the adage that “uncertainty breeds opportunity” rings true, but not in this case. Markets hate it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so it's now doubly important the Hang Seng Indexes Company and other compilers announce their final decision on dual-class shares, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is Hong Kong's rival, and not Shanghai or Shenzhen, when it comes to attracting “unicorns”, according to Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Asian stock exchanges are vying with each other to change listing rules in a bid to attract new economy companies and dual-class shareholding structure firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen have never been competitors of Hong Kong as we always cooperate with each other. Tong said on the sidelines of a regulatory forum on Wednesday. “Rather, Singapore is a competitor of Hong Kong,” adding that if dual-class shareholding companies were to list in Hong Kong and in the mainland, it would be a win-win situation for both.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) last month said it would bring forward its listing reform by several months, with its one-month long consultation due to end on March 23. Thereafter it plans to change the rules which will take effect in late April and start accepting listing applications of dual-class shares companies and biotech giant without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend that they had prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting unicorns - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and had already visited a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, chairman of </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)</span><span class="s1">, the mainland's top markets watchdog, confirmed last week that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) too is also planning to allow dual-class share structure companies to list as early as July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX, said last week that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong were planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a dual-class listing structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC's Tong said Hong Kong's stock market will not be affected by China's plans to attract new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong cooperates with mainland stock markets but we are very independent,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, owner of theSouth China Morning Post, chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structure allows shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian stock exchanges previously opposed such companies to list because it goes against the “one share one vote” principle. But now several exchanges are speeding up their reforms to explicitly allow dual-class shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of SFC, said at the same forum that the commission found shortcomings in the works of 31 financial firms that acted as listing sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some listing sponsors did not fulfil their duty with regards to due diligence on the companies they sponsored, falling short of the SFC requirements,” she said, adding the commission will issue a report on the matter soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also said the commission plans to study some brokers' demand to use WhatApp to take customer orders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class shares listing rules must reform to protect investors and prevent an erosion of corporate governance, the </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of people think that because dual-class shares structures work in other jurisdictions it will immediately, effortlessly translate into an APAC context,” said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1">. "We are trying to challenge some of those preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's listing rules changed in April to allow companies with dual-class shares to float on the bourse, giving founders and key management stronger voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Western countries, including the US, have had such rules in place for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, Tokyo implemented the change in 2015 and Singapore in June, but no companies have listed so far in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has traditionally been defined by a "one-share, one-vote” system, meaning all shareholders enjoy proportional representation in company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Hong Kong could not offer </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> a dual-class structure was thought to be a strong reason the Chinese tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014, and was indicative of the city losing out as an IPO destination. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms - aimed at attracting tech companies who want to maximise valuation and see their founders' vision through - have drawn two of the city's biggest tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi raised HK$54 billion (US$4.7 billion), while in September Beijing-based online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised HK$52.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in a survey carried out by </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> in March this year, 97 per cent of their members in Asia-Pacific believed safeguards were needed to protect investors from a few controlling stakeholders, according to a report published on Tuesday, named "Dual-class Shares: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong already offers an "event-based sunset”, where founders' stronger voting rights collapse if they leave the company or transfer shares. But more is needed, argued CFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global association of investment professionals recommended a mandatory "time-based sunset” where super voting rights will collapse to regular shareholder voting rights after no longer than five years post-IPO, to protect investors from a lack of control in their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insufficient investor protection was noted by 53 per cent of respondents as a key risk of dual-class shares, while 52 per cent highlighted the skewed proportionality between ownership and control, and 28 per cent identified an erosion of corporate governance standards.The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountableMary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountable,” said Leung. "No matter what public shareholders want, there is a limitation to what they can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the structure may make sense at the time of IPO, we don't believe it should carry on forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> of 157 dual-class structure IPOs in the US since the early 2000s found companies with ongoing weighted voting rights and those that allowed collapsed super voting rights, had similar valuations in the first two years after floating. From the third year, however, companies with collapsed voting rights began trading at a higher valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CFA respondents were also worried about their lack of education on how to invest in companies with dual-class share structures. The survey founds 60 per cent said they had no experience investing in such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some argue we don't need rules as we are all grown ups, in Asia because there is so much retail investment in the market when things go wrong, they look to the regulators,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Are we set up in the right way to look after these people? Investors must of course do due diligence on what they are buying, but a great deal of work can be done to raise awareness and education levels.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed regulations on variable interest entities (VIEs) in a new draft of China's foreign investment law may put more obstacles in the way of companies with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong while encouraging e-commerce firms to incorporate in the Shanghai free-trade zone, lawyers and accountants said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies have been using VIE structures to list overseas, allowing foreign capital to get around Beijing's foreign ownership restrictions on some sectors, such as the internet industry. </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Baidu all use such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In some cases where [China] has imposed shareholding restrictions on foreign investments in certain industries, the VIE structures may shield the shareholders in real control," said Roy Lo Wa-kei, a deputy managing partner of accounting firm Shinewing. "The proposed law would require more disclosure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government could gather more data from VIE firms through the new regulation. But the risks for the companies would be they might have to reveal any practice of non-compliance covered by the VIE structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The draft of the foreign investment law published by the Ministry of Commerce would legitimise VIE structures but also require companies using such structures to prove they were ultimately controlled by Chinese investors, otherwise they would be treated as foreign-invested enterprises and might fall foul of a "negative list" of industries with foreign investment restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law is now in a consultation period, with the deadline for submitting comments on February 17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Haiwen &amp; Partners, a Beijing-based law firm, said the regulations on VIEs could lead to obstacles for firms with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are not yet listed, the clauses on [Chinese] investors selling stakes in offshore companies to foreign investors could be subject to restrictions in the law on foreign investments, such as foreign ownership," Haiwen said in a note to clients. "In some cases, the clauses could not be implemented, thus there may be legal obstacles if they want to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"More disclosure would also be required when they list in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are already listed, restrictions on the transfer of [mainland] shareholders' shares in foreign investment would severely reduce the liquidity of their shares, and affect the valuation of such companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, said Alibaba, Baidu and other firms with dual-class share structures would benefit in the proposed regulatory change as dual-class share structures could help keep the company founders in control, which in turn would ensure their firms were not deemed foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, companies such as Tencent, with VIE structures but without dual-class shares, might be treated as foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed law encourages companies to set up using a dual-class share structure," Gillis said. "Hong Kong does not permit such companies to list, which will be a huge win for New York."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US exchange permits dual-class share structures, which was why Alibaba listed in New York instead of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The consultation paper points to a positive direction that VIE structures will be formally recognised by the [mainland] government and governed by the proposed new legislation," a Tencent spokesman said. "As this is in the early stage of consultation, we are monitoring the progress closely."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In order not to loose access to the Chinese market due to the regulatory change, e-commerce companies without ultimate mainland control might want to incorporate in or move their VIEs to the Shanghai free-trade zone, which had indicated it would allow wholly owned foreign investment in e-commerce, Gillis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Weiss, another law firm preparing to submit comments on the draft law, said more clarity was needed on whether a company would be deemed to have ultimate Chinese control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For example, what if the [Chinese] and foreign investors both satisfy the control definition? What if a founder of a VIE structure has de facto control over the business but only holds a small minority interest in the foreign parent entity controlling the VIE structure and does not have special board appointment rights?" it said in a note to clients.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should only allow exceptionally big technology firms with multiple class share structure to list in the city to prevent poor quality ones from abusing the system, say bankers and lawmakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing rule reform is exciting as it would allow more technology companies to consider the prospect of a Hong Kong listing and allow investors to be able to participate in these new economy companies,” Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive of China Renaissance, a Chinese investment bank that has helped many start-ups and biotech firms to list, told the South China Morning Post in an interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it is very important for HKEX [Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing] to keep the bar high to maintain high standards while accepting a broader range of listing candidates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is in the midst of its largest listing reform in decades aimed at lifting the exchange's attractiveness to compete for more technology firms to list here instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June large biotech firms without revenue and giant technology firms with dual class shareholding structure would be allowed to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class share companies allow one class of shareholders to have more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders. These are favoured by many tech firm founders as many of them hold minority stakes but want to have control. Meanwhile, biotech firms usually have no revenue in the research period. The current Hong Kong listing rules do not allow them to list here but they can list in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at the US, there are in fact not many technology companies listed in the dual class share structure, but only the very large and successful ones such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abused.”The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abusedFan Bao, chairman and CEO of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX next month will issue a detailed consultation on the listing reform, but Bao wants to see more investor protection measures in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The view is echoed by fund mangers and lawmakers, with many calling for a “sunset clause” - a provision that requires these dual class share companies, after certain years of listing, to seek shareholders' approval to continue with the structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing, however, told lawmakers during the financial affairs panel meeting last week that the exchange would not go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we were to introduce such a sunset clause, some tech companies might consider Hong Kong to be too restrictive and they may not come here to list,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenneth Leung, lawmaker for accountancy, said the exchange could consider setting a longer period such as 20 years for the sunset clause.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of letting the founders have special voting rights is to allow them to have control for a longer time to implement their vision. If they are doing well for 20 years, the investors would support and approve them to continue to have special voting rights. If they do not do a good job, investors should also have the right to say no,” Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission has unveiled key conditions for companies seeking to list in the city with dual-share structures, marking a major step forward in reform of the listing rules designed to help Hong Kong compete with the US in attracting listings by technology firms and other innovative enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conditions have high thresholds as the regulator does not plan to open the door too wide and allow too many companies to apply for such a shareholding structure, because the city does not allow class-action lawsuits to protect shareholders??interests, unlike the United States.The SFC still supports one share, one voteCarlson Tong, SFC chairman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC only wants to allow certain types of newly listed, innovative companies to be eligible for dual-share structures, and only as long as they meet conditions the SFC considers important for shareholder protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said companies applying for dual-share structures would have to be restricted to firms whose founders held only small stakes but whose contributions or innovations were vital to the business, such as in technology firms. Companies with majority shareholders should not be allowed to have such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other conditions designed to ensure investor protection should include sunset provisions, so that the special shareholding structure would end in a certain number of years or when the founders sold their stakes or left the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would support the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) carrying out a second phase of detailed consultation on dual-share structure reform if the exchange could address those issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC still supports one share, one vote,??Tong said. We do not plan to allow all companies to do it. However, we are not turning a deaf ear to market demand to enhance our market to compete with the US for new listings.??/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the first time the SFC had made its position clear on controversial listing reform proposals. HKEx is pushing for reforms to enable Hong Kong to maintain its position as a listing hub for mainland firms after the city lost some heavyweight technology firm listings to the US in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is the city's ultimate market regulator and the HKEx reform proposal would need its approval. Its position appears to clear a major obstacle for the reform, with some market watchers saying it could be introduced in six months to a year. That could help attract many technology firms such as mobile phone maker Xiaomi to list in Hong Kong instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx consulted the market last year on whether it should change listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure which it banned in 1989, after refusing to give Alibaba an exemption from the ban. The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only held a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong. The SFC still believes no exemption should be given but supports rules with clear conditions for companies seeking to apply for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba took its listing to New York, where dual-class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them were information technology companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structures allow one class of shareholder to have more rights than others. Many technology firms??founders sell stakes early on as they seek funding, resulting in them holding small stakes. They argue that dual-share structures protect their interests but many fund managers believe such structures are unfair because they would damage investor protection for small shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may amend its listing rules to accept companies with dual class shares and biotech companies with no revenue as early as late April, accelerating the timeline for the widely-expected listing regime change by several months, the bourse operator said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January predicted the listing rules could be amended from June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We bring the reform forward to late April as it would allow the listing of these companies in the summer period when June to August are active months,” Li said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have discussed this reform for a long time and a lot of issues have consensus already. We do not need the normal two months of consultation and could speed the process up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange on Friday issued a consultation paper detailing the proposed rule changes that will enable some companies with multiple-class share structures to list on the Hong Kong stock market, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation will last for one month, officially drawing to a close on March 23, while the consultation conclusion would be made in late April, officials said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Upon the issuance of the consultation conclusion and the implementation of the listing rules, the exchange will accept formal applications under the new regime,” the exchange said. Companies are welcome to make informal inquiries to the exchange ahead of the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few months we have collectively decided to take a big step forwards as a financial centre and welcome emerging and innovative companies. Now we are proposing a listing regime that will boost Hong Kong's attractiveness for a new generation of companies as well as investors, bringing more dynamism to our stock market,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said he supported the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The proposals are reasonable and can offer shareholder protection. It is particularly important that biotech companies must not change their principal business without prior approval by the exchange,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the HKEX, following an industry consultation, decided to proceed with reforms to allow dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, as long as the companies have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$10 billion (US$1.29 billion) and annual revenue of HK$1 billion. Companies that have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion would be exempt from the revenue requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our new secondary listing regime welcome both Chinese and international companies to apply,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies already listed under the dual-class share structure such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> or Baidu in the US, could apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong while maintaining their current structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If their share trading volume exceeds 55 per cent in Hong Kong, they could be classed as a dual primary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech companies taking advantage of the new listing regime would need to have a minimum market cap of HK$1.5 billion and be limited to sophisticated investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the exchange did not accept calls made by some fund managers for a sunset clause that would see the dual class structure expire after a period of years, or undergo a general vote by shareholders for renewal. The exchange said the rule would be too restrictive and prompt companies to look towards other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A sunset clause with an expiry date would create uncertainty for both companies and investors. It would be difficult for the companies to have long term development,” Li said. “It is also hard to determine what time frame would be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among safeguards to protect minority investors, some shareholder votes would be conducted on the basis of one share one vote. This would apply to issues involving the appointment and removal of independent directors and auditors, changes to constitutional documents, changes to the rights of any class of shares, and the winding up of the company, the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual class shares will have a “W” stock marker while biotech firms will have a “B” at the end of their share name to help investors identify their features.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong's stock market industry watchdog, will not be taking a front-row seat in new listing approvals, meaning the city can now push ahead with plans to launch a new market for dual-class shares in an effort top lure technology companies in particular to list here, according to brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The retreat by the SFC from taking a frontline role in approving new listings means HKEX (</span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">) and the listing committee can continue to share the task," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a local broker who is also the lawmaker representing the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is positive for the HKEX, allowing it to push ahead with another reform later, aimed at attracting more dual-class technology giants to list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class stock structure allows the issuing of various types of shares by a single company, where the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two share classes are typically issued: one share class is offered to the general public, and the other is offered to company founders, executives and family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to sources close to the matter, the SFC and HKEX are now set to unveil what commentators see as a watered-down conclusion to their five-month long consultation, with the SFC agreeing to back off from its desired front-line role in new listings approving, with the HKEX maintaining its primary role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is, however, to be represented on a new committee to formulate listing policies, but would not be able to appraise the performance of HKEX's listing staff, the sources told South China Morning Post on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC's retreat is obviously related to strong opposition from all sectors to its reform plans, with many worried that an upgraded role in approvals would have had a negative affect on the number of new listings," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the SFC now willing to compromise on listing reform, it is likely to be more open minded on allowing dual-class shares companies to list in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's two years since HKEX proposed allowing dual-class share listing in Hong Kong, which the SFC immediately opposed, fearing such a structure would be unfair to investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shares are still not allowed in Hong Kong, but the US does allow them, a factor which is largely credited with mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's opting for Wall Street instead of Hong Kong to list in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global equity strategist Christopher Wood said rejecting duel-listing in Hong Kong would be "stupid" and lead to lost future listing opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the key in future will be disclosure, and that as long as the dual-class shares companies were open about their shareholder structure, it would be up to investors to decide if they want to buy or walk away from an investment.The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpracticeJoseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed a two-month consultation into the launch of a new third board to allow dual-class share structure companies, and make it easier for start-ups to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform is expected to need a second consultation later this year. If it again gains strong support, the new board could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, however, maintains that dual-class shares could still be allowed to list on the main board instead of being forced to choose the new board. But he would not oppose market participants wanting to list on a new board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, believes the SFC will continue to use enforcement action to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpractice, if needed."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mike Wong Ming-wai, chief executive of the Chamber of Listed Companies of Hong Kong, said he was glad the SFC had retreated from its proposed plan to become directly involved in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We still worry, however, there may be over-regulation in the market if the SFC goes ahead with its proposal to set up a new committee involving its representatives in setting listing policies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC may still have an important influence on this committee and hence a tight curb on the new listing policies. We want to see Hong Kong remain a market that has listing rules friendly to all market players, instead of one which is regulatory led."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) expects to let the first company with a dual-class share structure list in the second half of this year as it looks to complement the Chinese onshore and Asian capital markets in allowing tech firms to raise funds, bourse officials told a media briefing in Hong Kong on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX said that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong are planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a have a dual-class listing structure that has operations in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Chinese companies make up 20 per cent of the market cap of companies listed in Singapore, according to Chew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We see ourselves playing an offshore complementary role to the emerging markets in Asia and that includes China and to a certain extent Hong Kong companies that are looking to expand overseas,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is expected to release its dual class share rules in the coming weeks and aims to be a lot more freer than other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, if you list an IPO in Hong Kong, the cornerstone investor is expected to be locked up for six months, but Singapore will not have that issue,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore may provide value when it come to the Chinese companies expanding their international business, and is likely to continue to attract consumer, tech, health care, REITs and infrastructure companies that want to extend their “overseas ambitions”, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly 40 per cent of all companies listed on SGX are international and account for more than 50 per cent of total market cap. Whereas only 6 per cent of all companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange are non-Chinese companies, according to data from the two exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's revamped IPO rules will take effect soon, allowing start-ups valued at US$1.5 billion to list shares under a dual-class shares scheme. Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has chosen the city over New York for its mega-IPO because of the planned reforms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore is a more international market than Hong Kong in terms of investors and companies that raise capital, Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it is a Chinese focused technology business Hong Kong does better; we acknowledge that. But when it is pan-Asia business and Southeast Asia business then we a little bit better off,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese technology businesses developing international applications and looking to expand such as into South East Asia and South Asia under China's Belt and Road Initiative may choose Singapore to obtain better valuations and attention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International investors from the US, Japan and Korea that want to invest in emerging Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia but cannot get access to the markets directly could also use Singapore to invest into these companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is a far more international destination,” Chew said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Singapore maintained their high ranks in a report on corporate governance published on Wednesday, but a decision to allow listings by dual-class shareholding companies has eroded their edge over other jurisdictions in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report was presented by brokerage CLSA and non-profit organisation Asia Corporate Governance Association. The association ranked Hong Kong second in the region, with a score of 60 in its biennial survey, followed by 59 for Singapore in third position. CLSA, on the other hand, ranked Singapore second with 70.1 points, Japan third with 66.7 points and Hong Kong fourth with 66.3 points. Australia topped the rankings in both cases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2016, the non-profit ranked Singapore second and Hong Kong third, while CLSA ranked the Lion City third and the special administrative region fourth, behind Japan and Australia in second and first places, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threat to that fundamental driver [of better corporate governance],” the association and CLSA said in their joint report. While a belief "in the value of transparency and accountability remains largely intact, the third principle, fairness, has come under fire”, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shareholders with dual-class shares have different voting rights. Through this structure - popular among emerging companies and industries - founding shareholders or key management with minority ownership can still retain control over company board directors and major decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has allowed companies with dual-class shares to list since April this year; Singapore followed in June, in the face of competition from exchanges in the United States that have long allowed such listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only two mainland China companies with dual-class shareholding structures have listed in Hong Kong so far: Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone supplier; and food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Yonts, head of environment, social and governance and power research at CLSA, a joint sponsor of Xiaomi's US$4.72 billion initial public offering this year, said its analysts had "marked down” Xiaomi on "fairness” when giving it a score, which was "in line” with the average score given to mainland Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asia Corporate Governance Association, said Hong Kong and Singapore's lead over other Asian markets would have been three to four points higher, had they not allowed dual-class share listings.The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threatCLSA, Asia Corporate Governance Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he believed the two cities would be able to maintain their edge, as there was no sign yet that lower ranked but close rivals Malaysia and Taiwan would follow suit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the problem in Malaysia is, if they start losing some of their technology companies to Singapore, Hong Kong or the US, then clearly there will be pressure on them. It really depends on what happens in the next six to 12 months, in terms of where some of their companies choose to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said he was worried that a "contagion” had already started, and gave the example of South Korea signalling this year an interest in allowing small businesses and venture start-ups to issue dual-class shares, to encourage more small technology companies to list on the Kosdaq second board market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was ranked by the association on the basis of "original and independent research”, with no input from outside respondents to 121 questions it designed to assess a country's corporate governance. The questions cover government policies, regulatory rules and enforcement, investors' participation in corporate governance and corporate audit standards, besides society and media monitoring. The association also incorporated findings from an in-depth look at disclosure and governance practices of 25 large and mid-capitalisation stocks in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, meanwhile, used a "bottom-up” approach by examining 1,100 listed companies' governance in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said Hong Kong's move to set up an independent regulator for the audit industry next year is positive, but bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> had not gone far enough in its recent corporate governance code revamp, on issues including gender diversity and limits on the number of corporate boards individual directors are allowed to sit on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, the trial of so-called mixed ownership in state companies - private and state capital - had yielded mixed results, said Allen. The reform would fare better on the governance front if private funds were allowed to invest in units spun off from state-owned enterprises, and appoint representatives in their independent new boards, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun[http://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] on Monday promised to consider listing the company in Hong Kong and increasing investment in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma was responding to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam]'s invitation at the inauguration ceremony of the Hong Kong Association of Zhejiang Entrepreneurs on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The executive chairman of the e-commerce giant, who is also the chairman of the General Association of Zhejiang Entrepreneurs, engaged in a fireside discussion with Lam during the ceremony, where Ma praised Lam for possessing great leadership for offering the invitation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A mere politician will never dare to say so,” Ma said. “Alibaba will take this message. We will definitely consider Hong Kong's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope we can further invest in Hong Kong and enhance our participation in the city's economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam's invitation came after the passing of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposal to allow companies offering different classes of shares with different voting power to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now I hope Alibaba can come back to list in Hong Kong,” Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the stock exchange had decided to start allowing the dual-class share system in midyear, and described allowing the system as a form of economic innovation.I have never been as confident in Hong Kong as todayJack Ma</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the move would encourage more companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The passing of the system follows local authorities' rejection of a plan by Alibaba in 2014 to adopt a structure that would allow Ma to appoint more than half of the company's board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures, while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the ceremony, Ma said he first met Lam in the chief executive's office and talked with her for about 20 minutes, during which time they discussed the rejection, as well as how to encourage young start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I believe the passing of the dual-class share system will bring great changes and will help Hong Kong greatly in its future reforms,” he said. “I have never been as confident in Hong Kong as today.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma said there were many young talented people in Hong Kong and he urged them to find more opportunities on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said she believed the city could nurture entrepreneurs like Ma and invited Ma to share his innovation experiences with local young people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and Lam have met each other more than once before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Ma met Lam at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province. During the meeting, Ma offered to play a bigger role in helping Hong Kong develop a “more fashionable”, cashless society, by taking advantage of Alibaba's growing data clouding and e-payment systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November in Hong Kong, at the grand finale of Alibaba's start-up competition, Jumpstarter 2017, the pair chatted about how Hong Kong could attract technology talents from the outside and how local talent can take advantage of opportunities elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In her first policy address in October, Lam said she would lead a new high-level interdepartmental steering committee on innovation and technology, and emphasised the importance of Hong Kong becoming a “smart city” to maintain its global competitiveness.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With big Chinese technology and internet initial public offerings potentially in the pipeline, Hong Kong's decision to revamp its IPO rules could tip the balance in its favour as it battles for China listings with New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies are increasingly more positive on Hong Kong as a preferred listing destination,” said Mervyn Chow, the co-head of investment banking and capital markets, Asia-Pacific, and Greater China chief executive at Credit Suisse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said on Friday it would propose rule changes to allow dual-class shares on the main board, with a formal public consultation to be launched as early as the first quarter of 2018. The overhaul in listing regulations could be the city's most drastic in three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rule changes to allow dual-class shares will enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness vis-a- vis the US, especially for Chinese technology IPOs. It is the right timing for Hong Kong to make these changes. It will be a game changer,” Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a group of rapidly expanding Chinese technology and internet companies nears the stage of going public, the battle for big Chinese listings has intensified between Hong Kong and its fundraising rivals, such as New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the privately owned Chinese smartphone maker, has been in talks with investment banks for a possible IPO as soon as next year, which might value the company at more than US$50 billion, versus a valuation of US$46 billion at its most recent funding round in 2014, according to media reports. Either Hong Kong or New York could host the listing, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong refits listing rules in race with New York for IPO crown [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124503/hong-kong-overhauls-citys-stock-listing-rules-attract-biotech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If valued at US$50 billion, Xiaomi's float will be the third-largest technology IPO in history, surpassing Snap's US$24 billion listing in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> , which owns the South China Morning Post, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> rank No. 1 and No. 2, with valuations of US$167 billion and US$104 billion, respectively, when they were listed in 2014 and 2012 in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> , has also invited investment banks to handle its planned listing next year, which could value the unit at US$10 billion, Bloomberg reported recently, citing unnamed sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has already seen a flurry of fundraising in 2017 by technology and internet companies, with five of its 10 largest IPOs by companies operating in the new economy, compared with none last year. Listings by banks and securities companies, staples of Hong Kong's capital market, have halved to 30 per cent of this year's top IPOs, from 60 per cent last year, in line with regulators' goals to draw more new economy companies to float here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, Tencent's China Literature debuted on the Hong Kong market, and its US$1.06 billion IPO attracted overwhelming investor demand, in what was the hottest listing in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other potential technology IPOs in the forthcoming year could include: </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Company of China's peer-to-peer online-lending platform Lufax, which could raise up to US$5 billion in a planned Hong Kong IPO as soon as the first half of 2018; its Chinese rival Dianrong.com, backed by Singapore's GIC, which is also considering a Hong Kong listing to raise least US$500 million; as well as Hong Kong's online finance lending platform WeLab, with a possible listing size of US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu's video streaming site </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is targeting an IPO as soon as next year, to value it at up to US$10 billion, with New York a possible listing destination, according to reports this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is Hong Kong's IPO fever over after Nissin and Shandong Trust fail to excite? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> , the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> fintech affiliate that operates Alipay, has delayed its IPO. Jack Ma Yun , the Alibaba chairman, said last month he would possibly consider an IPO for </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> in two years, but not in the next 12 to 18 months. The venue for this listing is also undecided. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> was valued at US$60 billion in its last funding round in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> 's Chow said Chinese issuers usually prefer a Hong Kong listing, as it is closer to their home market and enables access to a larger pool of international as well as mainland investors, who typically have a good understanding of the business models and the products that tend to be relevant locally. “This has been important for Chinese technology firms, which are largely ‘product companies' focused on building and selling products to consumers.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the proposed move to a dual-class share structure, more innovative companies might choose Hong Kong as a listing destination. Moreover, the changes might bring new opportunities for investors, which would boost the liquidity of the city's capital market, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These opportunities include new IPO products, such as potentially a trading link to enable mainland investors to buy into Hong Kong IPOs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital, said he had already seen a rising willingness among his clients in China to favour Hong Kong as an IPO destination. Wan said he expected the first dual-class share company to appear on the Hong Kong market as early as the second half of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year we've had several hot tech IPOs, such as ZhongAn Online, China Literature and Razer, which have ignited investors' enthusiasm towards new-economy stocks and raised expectations about more tech and internet listings coming to Hong Kong, such as the highly anticipated IPOs of Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> ,” said Kenny Shui, a senior researcher at Our Hong Kong Foundation, a Hong Kong-based think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a key issue would be how Hong Kong can protect retail investors at the same time, as dual-class shares give company founders much more power over their business even if they hold a small portion of the shares, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is up for another round of market reform as the stock exchange will solicit views from the public at the end of the month for a new board to allow more technology firms like Alipay and Lufax, as well as foreign giant companies such as </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchange is at the final stage of preparation in the details of this new board. We hope to have the consultation about launching this new board by the end of May,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which runs the stock and futures exchanges in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the sideline of the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> Week Asia forum on Wednesday, Li said they were keen to have a bigger variety of companies to list here, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO that is expected to raise US$100 billion, in a 5 per cent stake sale of the oil giant valued at US$2 trillion. Hong Kong is in the running for the listing, but is facing competition from London and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new market which brokers call the third board, will be the third market in Hong Kong after the Main Board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said in January that the new board would have different listing rules from the other two markets to allow more foreign firms, infrastructure firms, overseas companies on the “Belt and Road Initiative”, technology or new-economy companies, and firms that want to be listed in a dual-class shareholding structure, to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX rekindles plans for dual-class share structure in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2063569/hkex-rekindles-plans-dual-class-share-structure-city]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be a good idea for the HKEX to launch a new board to attract more technology firms to list. Hong Kong has many big banks and financial giants to list, but we have too few technology companies listings here,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector, and is himself a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firms. This would be better than changing the rules for the main board and the GEM,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung however, said the consultation needed to also offer suggestions to safeguard the interests of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We also want the HKEX to have good communication with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, for the regulator to support the reform. We do not want to repeat the chaos two years ago when the stock exchange proposed rule change on dual shareholding structure, and the plan was rejected by the SFC immediately,” he said.A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firmsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many new-economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares with a dual-share structure as their founders tend to hold on to a minority stake but want to retain control. Dual-share structures allow certain shareholders to have more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York over Hong Kong in 2014, as the SFC considers its shareholding structure to be a dual-class shareholding that is banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US. Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called Hong Kong listing rules outdated, that they do not meet the needs of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pain of Alibaba loss prompts HKEX to examine new measures[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2012339/pain-alibaba-loss-prompts-hkex-examine-new-measures]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - payment arm of a unit of Alibaba - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> are both considering to list to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the plan a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time would be different as the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing last month said the commission had agreed to a consultation on the third board, including the dual-class share proposal. The change in attitude was because the type of listings would be limited to the new board, while the previous proposal applied to the entire market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, HKEX would face an uphill battle to convince all stakeholders to accept the dual-class shareholding structure. Many fund mangers such as </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> and Templeton Franklin are opposed to it as they consider the structure unfair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be good to have a new market in Hong Kong to attract different types of companies to list here. But as usual, devil is in the details. We need to see if the HKEX proposals are flexible enough to attract new technology companies to list here, while at the same time, that there is sufficient investor protection,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Stockbrokers Association chairman Benny Mau said if the HKEX would propose a third board, it would need to clearly define how the role and listing requirements are different from those for the main board and the GEM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The consultation paper should also consult the market if all investors could invest in this new board or if it should be for institutional investors to trade only,” Mau said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the SFC, say they will work together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for new economy companies, adding momentum to the proposed new stock market for dual class shares after regulators embraced a water down version of listing reforms on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform should not be seen as a power struggle between the SFC and HKEX. The two regulators and the government all want to work together to upgrade the quality of Hong Kong markets and to see that the market operates more efficiently,” said James Lau, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the listing reform package, the Securities and Futures Commission agreed to abandon its controversial proposal last year for a frontline role in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central listing approval process will remain in the hands of HKEX and its listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC also agreed to abandon a proposal to review the performance of listing division staff. The responsibility will instead remain part of the purview of HKEX executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not a climb down which is a wrong way to describe the conclusion. We are listening to comments and consider the current approach more effective,” said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The conclusion will clarify the roles of SFC and HKEX in vetting new listings. Many problems happen after companies get listed. This is why post-listing enforcement is important,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will retain its role in setting listing policies, while a 12 member advisory panel will support the listing committee in setting policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government and the SFC and the stock exchange are open minded to carefully study how to carry out reforms to make sure our market could attract new economies to list here while at the same time we protect the interest of investors,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The water downed listing reforms come after a five-month controversial consultation last year, which received 8,500 submissions from brokers, listed companies and financial professionals. Ninety-four per cent of respondents were against the proposed reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said the listing reform result was a blow to the SFC and a victory for the HKEX and would likely help pave way for the launch of a third board supporting dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 the HKEX pushed for a consultation process on whether to launch dual class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX completed a two month consultation on the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board was among the top agenda items at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in August, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange operator has deferred a planned consultation on expanding listing reforms to allow corporate investors to own premium shares with greater voting rights in companies that have a so-called dual-class share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision is a further setback for the sweeping reforms, which have so far failed to generate the much hoped-for slew of applications from big technology firms eager to raise capital on the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange introduced new rules in April to allow companies with dual-class shareholding rights, or weighted voting rights, to list here. The reform allows individual founders or certain key executives of these companies to own shares that carry more voting rights than those of other shareholders. The move was aimed at attracting more technology companies, which tend to favour this structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) had said initially it would launch a separate consultation by July 31 on whether it should also allow companies to own the special voting-class shares. The bourse, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that this consultation would not be launched after all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said: “Given that the current weighted voting-rights regime has only recently been put in place, the exchange believes it should deliberate further the extended weighted voting-rights regime and should continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to develop a broader consensus on the subject matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the exchange has decided not to launch a corporate weighted voting-rights consultation at this time as initially planned. The exchange will update the market on the subject in due course.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief expects more IPOs under Hong Kong's new listing regime after summer break[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2146645/hkex-chief-expects-more-ipos-under-hong-kongs-new-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marks another setback for the biggest overhaul of the local bourse's listing rules in 25 years, which was carried out amid high hopes that it would attract technology giants with dual-class shares as well as biotech firms that are yet to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Almost three months on, only two companies with the dual-class shareholding structure - smartphone maker Xiaomi and online food-delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> - have applied for listing. Hangzhou-based </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in mainland China, is the first pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing, and has just closed its IPO. There are seven more biotechnology firms that have applied for listings, but they are still awaiting approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is somewhat disappointing,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector. “We would like to see the HKEX continue its listing reform to accept diversified companies to list, including those with different shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it may be a good move to slow down the pace to allow more parties to discuss further on the reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiaomi's recent IPO not living up to its expectations of raising US$10 billion and some Chinese tech firms opting to float their shares in the US and Shanghai, Hong Kong could only maintain its No 3 global IPO ranking in the first half, unchanged from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong retail investors give Xiaomi's IPO the cold shoulder, put off by high financing cost and valuation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced earlier this month they would not allow dual-class shareholding companies listed in Hong Kong to be traded by mainlanders via the stock connect schemes, a further blow to the effectiveness of the listing reforms. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiao-jia flew to Beijing last week to negotiate, and the three bourses agreed to look at when dual-class companies might be allowed to trade via the stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, supported the HKEX decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The dual-class shareholding listing reform was only launched three months ago. The market participants and investors still need time to digest the reform. It would be too soon to launch another consultation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX would be better off focusing on working with the mainland regulators to sort out the issue of mainlanders being able to trade the dual-class shares via the stock connect. That would be more important than making further changes to the listing reform.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore's effort to score the 2018 listing of state oil giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> - expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering - is the latest show of its ambition to develop an elite global exchange, but analysts say a lack of liquidity in the Lion City should mean Hong Kong will hold firm as Asia's top bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fierce courtship of Aramco has brought into focus how the region's exchanges are dangling new carrots to attract multibillion-dollar listings that have dried up since the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba in 2014 - the largest to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One incentive being considered in Singapore and Hong Kong is an easing of the one-share, one-vote orthodoxy in order to accommodate technology companies that prefer dual-class share structures in which the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco, which is planning an initial listing of just five per cent of its equity in 2018, has so far not shown an interest in dual-class shares, but Singapore is offering other sweeteners. These include the possibility that GIC, one of the city state's two sovereign wealth funds, could become a cornerstone investor. On February 2, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom was considering concurrent listings of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With its estimated oil reserves of 265 billion barrels - or 15 per cent of the world's proven reserves - the company is expected to be valued at around US$2 trillion. A five per cent flotation would raise US$100 billion, four times the amount raised by Alibaba, the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco's share offer is the centrepiece of the influential Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's strategy to attract foreign investment and wean the country off its dependence on oil revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market observers said the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX), the city state's sole stock market operator, would be looking to differentiate itself from the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (NYSE) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) by touting the island nation's neutral stance in geopolitics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US President Donald Trump's erratic Middle East foreign policy, coupled with legislation passed last year that allows victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, are seen in some quarters as factors that could deter Aramco from listing on the NYSE. With Hong Kong, questions remain over the extent of the city's legal autonomy from Beijing, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The biggest case for Singapore to woo Aramco would be that it is a truly neutral ground compared to everywhere else,” said Song Seng Wun, a Singapore-based economist with CIMB Private Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On purely market-based factors, however, the Singapore exchange is unlikely to upstage its bigger counterpart in Hong Kong any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily value of shares traded in the Lion City in January was S$1.05 billion (HK$5.74 billion), about a 10th of the HK$57.2 billion worth of shares traded in Hong Kong over the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total market capitalisation of SGX in 2016 was S$926 billion (HK$5.06 trillion), compared with HK$24.8 trillion in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore is just a smaller, niche market with limited liquidity compared to Hong Kong,” said Song, the Singapore-based economist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eddie Wong, partner of capital markets services at PwC in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong had an advantage over its regional rivals because of its deep ties with the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People [on the mainland] like doing deals in a familiar place and with people they know,” Wong said. Apart from mainland Chinese firms, South Asian companies were also increasingly showing interest in being listed in Hong Kong, Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An endemic lack of liquidity and the difficulty in luring Chinese IPOs away from Hong Kong are just two of several obstacles the SGX is facing. Its ambition of being an “Asian Gateway” is increasingly under threat by the rising stature of other Southeast Asian bourses like the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the </span><span class="s3">Indonesia Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, and Malaysia's Bursa Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite falling global deal volumes, Asian exchanges are likely to see an uptick in flotations as “it is relatively early days for many of the equity markets in Asia including mainland China and many Southeast Asian markets,” said David Erickson, the former co-head of global equity markets at </span><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ace up Singaporean stock market regulators' sleeves could be the introduction of dual class shares before the city's rivals. Technology start-ups have shown a preference for such tiered stocks, but critics charge that they give founders outsized control cheaply and disadvantage minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on Alibaba's IPO because the Chinese e-commerce giant was adamant on a tiered share structure that the city's rules do not permit. SGX was edged out by the NYSE for the 2012 IPO of English football giant </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> for the same reason. The city state has not had a multibillion-dollar IPO since the 2011 listing of </span><span class="s3">Hutchison Port Holdings Trust</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye in January said the exchange would soon launch a public consultation on permitting dual class shares. HKEX chief Li Xiaojia, meanwhile, has said the exchange will launch a similar exercise. The Hong Kong had plans to relaunch dual class shares in 2015 (they have been banned in the city since 1989) but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> shot down the idea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If Singapore goes ahead with the plan, I am afraid it will be a race to the bottom. Hong Kong will not be able to resist the political pressure to [introduce dual-class shares] and both markets will hurt themselves,” said Jamie Allen, the Hong Kong-based secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. “It goes against the principle of fairness...dual-class structures are unfair to minority shareholders,” said Allen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuck Seng Tham, capital markets leader at PwC in Singapore, said risks associated with tiered share structures could be “properly managed instead of avoided, with the appropriate safeguards”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said Singapore and Hong Kong were unlikely to make a decision on dual-class shares by the end of this year. ■</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A high-powered financial forum initiated by new Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and chaired by Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has discussed reforms to attract more new-economy companies to list on our stock market. It is a clear signal of the key part the direction of economic development is expected to play in Lam's first policy address next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new economy has already galvanised the traditional business rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore, which are both now playing catch-up to avoid being left behind. The island state may become the first Asian bourse to allow dual-class-share initial public offers - a reform also at the top of the agenda of the Hong Kong forum - in a bid to become a tech hub and a regional magnet for IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has also so far not allowed such listings, which enable founding shareholders to retain control with minority holdings by giving some shares more weight, because of worries about sidelining ordinary shareholders. But they have been on the city's mind ever since e-commerce giant Alibaba - owner of the Post - took its dual-class-share listing to New York after it was rejected by Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time for Hong Kong to define the ‘new economy' amid talk of third board at stock exchange[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2105149/time-hong-kong-define-new-economy-amid-talk-third-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent public consultation on the controversial idea is reported to have revealed consensus among finance industry professionals on broadening the market and allowing dual-class shares on a third trading board that would also host start-ups with no profit record, but division on how to go about it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> both presented briefings and will do follow-up work before the forum reconvenes in the last quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, but we face regional competitors who are prepared to undertake aggressive structural reforms in a bid to capture the opportunities offered by China's rise. If Hong Kong does not push forward and clings to old ways of doing business, it stands to miss out. In that respect it is good that in Lam's consultations ahead of her policy address, a recurring theme of her remarks has been the need to strike a balance between regulation to protect investors and development, in order to meet the needs of the new economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the development of the new economy, share structures can be quite different from traditional companies. As a result regulations are prone to become outdated. It is good to see the government set up this forum headed by the financial secretary to look into the issue. We trust economic policy will be a centrepiece of the policy address, and that the government will set some landmark direction on where Hong Kong is headed over the next five years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, recognising the competitive pressures the city faces in attracting listings by new economy companies, has thrown its weight behind the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed listing reform that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list here, its chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This confirmed a South China Morning Post report on the regulator's support for a change that will hopefully attract big mainland players such as Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is a competition issue. It is not just the US - the UK and Singapore also want to attract technology and new economy companies to list. Hong Kong needs to play catch up,” Tong said in a media briefing on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hoped at least one giant tech company would list here under the new rules by October 2018, when he retires after a six-year stint with the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong, while the tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu would consider secondary listings here after the new rule changes for dual-class share companies are introduced next year,” said Tong.“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong.”Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman, Securities and Futures Commission</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This follows the rejection in 2014 of a plan by e-commerce giant Alibaba to adopt a structure that would allow its founder, Jack Ma Yun, and key executives to appoint more than half of the company's board. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange in 2015 proposed to allow these companies to list but the proposal was scrapped following objections by the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> unveiled a proposal to allow giant technology companies with at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) to list with multiple classes of shares, and biotech companies with no revenue to list in Hong Kong after a rule change by mid next year. This time, Tong indicated his support but stressed that proper investor protection measures must be in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Let us be clear, we still believe that ‘one-share, one-vote' is the gold standard since it has never been proven that companies with weighted voting rights perform better in the long run. We do accept, however, that to attract new economy companies to list in Hong Kong and to make our market more vibrant, we need to change,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The challenge that Hong Kong faces is one of competition, which is fully supported by market statistics, he said. About 50 per cent of the mainland technology companies listed in the United States have multiple-class shareholding structures, versus only 17 per cent for non-mainland technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, only 8 per cent of mainland non-technology companies listed in the US have multiple-class shareholding structures, about the same level as non-mainland non-technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This suggests that mainland technology companies prefer weighted voting rights structures and if Hong Kong wants to attract these companies to list in its market, we have to find a way to accommodate those that we consider to be of substance and quality,” he said, adding that the commission will work closely with HKEX on safeguards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong also said one of the reasons for the commission's objection in 2015 was that due to large fund houses worries about these companies would be added to the benchmark index and, as such, passive fund managers would be forced to invest in them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Recently, both FTSE Russell and S&amp;P have decided to place restrictions on the admission of companies with weighted voting rights in their indices, although MSCI has decided to carry out further consultation,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, some large fund houses such as Black Rock rejected the idea of index providers restricting weighted voting rights companies from their index as they believe the fund houses should have the right to choose what companies to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They would rather see protective measures such as sunset clauses. Clearly, there has been a slow shift of mindset … accepting some form of weighted voting rights companies.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regard to the commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption</span><span class="s1"> (ICAC) joining hands to raid the offices of financial company Convoy Global, Tong declined to comment on the case but confirmed the commission would, where necessary, continue to collaborate with other regulators and enforcement agencies such as ICAC, Hong Kong Police and mainland regulator </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> in combating financial crimes to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said investors should be aware of market uncertainties in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Going into 2018, the capital market may face many uncertainties, including Brexit, geopolitical risks in North Korea and the Middle East, and the US interest rate rises,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US stock market may adjust itself and if it happens, it will affect the rest of the world, including Hong Kong, which has recorded substantial gains over the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would therefore like to remind investors that they need to be very cautious and prudent in making their investment decisions and to not take excessive risks.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A proposal by Hong Kong and mainland China's stock exchanges to let investors partake in initial public offerings in each other's markets has been given an added impetus by the prospect of attracting the US$2 trillion </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is one of several global equity bourses including New York, London, Tokyo, Toronto and Singapore contending to be the staging ground for Aramco's IPO, estimated to be US$100 billion in size. The proposal, known as the “Primary Equity Connect,” would let investors from China's US$7.6 trillion capital market gain access to the Aramco IPO through Hong Kong, increasing the city's attractiveness as a place for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From China's side, Aramco listing in Hong Kong can also provide a “natural hedge” for domestic investors against the oil price volatility, said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the exchange operator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The “primary equity connect” and the Aramco listing in Hong Kong can be a successful combination, as both sides are able to benefit from it, Li said during a conference in the city. “It's a win-win situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li didn't specify on the timetable of the launch of primary equity connect, but said the exchange has been in talks with relevant parties. “We never stop (the talks),” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Li said in his blog that the “Primary Equity Connect” is feasible from a technical perspective, but important work remains for regulators to iron out the right regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The connect plan is the latest piece of a process of fostering closer integration between Hong Kong's equity market with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has launched three of the so-called connect schemes since 2014 with Chinese markets to facilitate cross-border trading. These comprised the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016, and the Bond Connect in July.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco, owned and run by the government of Saudi Arabia, plans to sell up to 5 per cent of the oil company in a 2018 IPO in one or more international markets beyond the stock exchange in Riyadh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even listing only 5 per cent of the US$2 trillion company would lead to a US$100 billion IPO, the biggest ever in world history, and leagues ahead of Alibaba's record US$25 billion flotation in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, Li also said the HKEX has finished the consultation on a new trading board and the conclusion could “hopefully” come out in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX started a public consultation in June for establishing a so-called “third board”, after the current board and Growth Enterprise Market, aiming to lure more new economy listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board could allow companies ranging from internet start-ups to biotech firms with dual-class share structures to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX has received positive feedbacks about establishing the “third board”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange might launch a second round of consultation on details about listing rules, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to find new ways to lure new economy companies to stay competitive,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX proposed in 2015 to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February, Singapore's stock exchange started a public consultation on introducing a dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted to list in New York as its corporate governance structure was refused in Hong Kong.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has failed to secure a spot in the top 10 league table for funds raised from IPOs of technology companies worldwide, which surged three times to US$18.87 billion in the first eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong's main board only ranked at the world's 12th largest market in terms of IPO funds raised by technology companies, while the second board Growth Enterprise Market ranked 19th.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This marks a contrast to the ranking for the world's largest IPO market, where Hong Kong's main board is placed fourth as its strength lies in drawing financial firms to list, but not technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Hong Kong has seen improvement this year. So far, three technology firm IPOs have raised a combined US$424.1 million this year, which is 30 times higher than the same period last year when one firm raised US$14.8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increase is largely attributed to the IPO of FIT Hon Teng, a subsidiary of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and maker of connectors for Apple's iPhones that raised US$393.58 million in June. It was also the world's eighth largest technology firm IPO this year.</span></p>

The volume is substantially lower than the New York Stock Exchange, the top technology IPO centre, where four technology firm IPOs to date have raised US$4.56 billion, accounting for 24.2 per cent of global funds raised, the Thomson Reuters data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Swiss Stock Exchange ranked second and South Korean ranked third, while Shenzhen ChiNext ranked fourth, and Singapore was fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other markets,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the city's financial services sector.Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other marketsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has been a worldwide trend that there are more and more new economy and technology companies seeking for listings. They are the future driving force of the worldwide economy. If our market could not capture these companies to list, we would lag behind,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has just completed a consultation to set up a third board to attract more technology companies to list, but it would still need a second round of consultation for the detailed rules. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wants the new board to be launched in the first half of 2018, but he will have to convince all stakeholders to accept the proposals that have received very mixed reactions during the two-month consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have different regulations from the existing main board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has proposed the third board to have two markets: a premium market for companies eligible to list on the main board but with dual-class shareholding structures and open to all investors, and a second market for start-ups and open only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong currently bans dual class shares which are allowed in the US. Dual class shareholding allows founders or key management of the companies to own shares with more voting rights than the others, which large technology firms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> preferred.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the largest technology IPO this year which raised US$3.9 billion on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in March, also has a dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, Francis Leung Pak-to on Monday showed support for a new market for dual class share companies with a market cap of HK$8 billion (US$1 billion) to list, but opposed to a start-up board market as he said the risks of failures of these newly set up companies were too high.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A contentious proposal to allow dual share listings on Hong Kong's bourse emerged top of the agenda at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by the chief executive, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forum, championed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] and chaired by the finance chief, held its first meeting on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po[http://www.scmp.com/topics/paul-chan] confirmed the attendees had discussed whether to allow dual-class share companies to list in the city after receiving separate briefings from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We had a very good discussion with some very good opinions raised,” Chan told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He revealed the two market bodies would do “follow-up work” on what had been discussed and that the forum would meet again next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A government statement quoted Chan as saying at the closed-door meeting: “The Government attaches great importance to enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. While we endeavour to uphold market quality, we should also actively seek to further develop and broaden our capital markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the meeting, HKEX, operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, set out its proposal for the establishment of a third board to give companies with dual-share structures a way to list as well as those with no track record of profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The public consultation ended earlier this month, with financial industry professionals still divided over the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia, who is not a member of the forum, presented on Wednesday.Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit?Dr David Wong Yau-kar, MPF Schemes Authority</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's support reflects a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it deemed the proposal at the time lacking sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As recently as last month, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder, also a forum member, said there was a need to reposition Hong Kong's listed market amid the shrinking size of initial public offerings in the past decade and trading volume in newly listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there was a need to strike a balance between “a healthier supply of interesting companies” at the top end of the stock market and greater demand by investors for more diverse companies at the lower end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source at the meeting revealed that the consultation showed consensus on broadening markets and allowing dual-class shares but opinion was split on how to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carrie Lam, who met the forum members before they had their pow-wow, was quoted in the government press release as saying that the financial services sector, as a pillar industry contributing 18 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, should seize opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area proposal to “better serve our real economy”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many major technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> offer dual-class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. Unlike the US, Hong Kong bars such shares, favouring the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forum member Dr David Wong Yau-kar, chairman of the Mandatory Provident Fund[http://www.scmp.com/topics/mpf] Schemes Authority, noted the attendees on Wednesday had raised their views on the proposed third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most people agree Hong Kong should attract new-economy companies to list here, but the question is how to do it. Do we need a new board?” he asked. “Do we accept dual-class share companies? Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit? There are many different ways to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong added he could not detail individual views or the government's stance, citing confidentiality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/30/5bbc1156-8d4b-11e7-9f40-4d9615941c08_image_hires_210652.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other forum members include Hong Kong Monetary Authority[http://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-monetary-authority] Chief Executive Norman Chan Tak-lam, Securities and Futures Commission CEO Ashley Alder, and Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Executive councillors Bernard Chan, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, Chow Chung-kong and Joseph Yam Chi-kwong are also members, as are Carlson Tong Ka-shing and Moses Cheng Mo-chi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 30 government reports on financial matters were distributed to the 10 forum members to keep track of proposals and their implementation and they agreed to meet again in the next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong described the forum as not a decision-making body but a high-ranking consultation group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Carrie Lam is very concerned about the group, as she initiated it in her manifesto,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chief executive announced the forum during her election campaign earlier this year, saying the government should play a more active and leading role in policymaking and matters of monetary stability, financial safety and regulation. The idea was to reinforce Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam believed the forum could offer a platform to discuss strategic and forward-looking proposals and keep track of the implementation of such proposals by government departments and other relevant parties.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government yesterday came out in support of the Securities and Futures Commission's stance in the controversy over Alibaba's listing plans and rejected calls to strip the stock exchange of its power to approve listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock exchange has no plans to consult the market about any change in listing rules. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine," Chan Ka-keung, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, said at a Legislative Council meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the law, the chief executive can issue directives to the SFC, meaning the government has the final say on any listing issue, but it has never exercised this power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant lobbied the SFC and the stock exchange last month to be allowed to have a partnership structure that would have let its top executives nominate the majority of board members. The regulators refused to budge, saying there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another. Alibaba has since reportedly been looking at listing in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Legislator Charles Mok, who represents the information technology sector, asked the government if new policies were being considered to attract technology firms to list in the city. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine CHAN KA-KEUNG</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an attack on regulators following the rebuff, Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai said last month: "Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes" and "look forward as the rest of the world passes it by".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan rejected allegations that Hong Kong was lagging behind and said that a number of "high quality" technology firms had listed in the city. "Hong Kong is not the only market worldwide to ban dual-class share structures … Most markets ban such structures," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US is the only market that allows the dual-class share structure. The US regulator, the SEC, in the 1980s appealed to the courts to ban such structures. The court ruled the issue would have to be determined by state law. The US has a different system from Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the legislator representing the financial services sector, asked Chan to consider stripping </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> of its power to approve listings, saying there was a conflict of interest between its obligation to shareholders and its role as a regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have seen many mainland companies facing problems shortly after listing here. The government should consider taking away the HKEx's regulatory role," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said that was unnecessary because the SFC had been monitoring the exchange's approval of listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the stock exchange had officially said "no" to Alibaba's proposal, Cheung said there was concern that it had worked with Alibaba behind the scenes to find a way out of the impasse before it had finally agreed to the SFC's stance against any relaxation of the rules.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange is making its biggest push in decades to attract Chinese tech companies. But Wall Street is not fazed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the city fell from the top and slid behind New York and Shanghai in overall dollar volume raised through initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an effort to regain supremacy, the bourse said in December it would relax rules to allow controversial dual-class share listings and let young biotech firms list before they turn profitable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital markets professionals on Wall Street agree that the proposed changes, once they take effect, are likely to make Hong Kong more competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these are not earth-shattering alterations, given their availability on bourses globally for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is largely matching what other Exchanges currently permit,” said Gregg Noel, head of the West Coast capital markets practice at law firm </span><span class="s3">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom LLP</span><span class="s1">, which has advised hundreds of IPOs globally, including Chinese online retailer </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">'s 2014 IPO on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes “will be immensely helpful for Hong Kong to try to take the cream of the crop,” he said, indicating that the rule-easing aims to attract a particular group of fast-growing Chinese tech and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not going to suddenly shift the rest of the global listers' attention entirely to Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma to consider listing Alibaba on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also a less-than-adequate challenge to the US IPO market, which remains the most liquid and mature in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You have the deepest pockets in the US,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management. “The demand is high for Chinese IPOs because the returns are great.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funtleyder's fund, for example, saw its investment in Chinese biopharma company </span><span class="s3">BeiGene Limited</span><span class="s1"> quadruple as the firm's stock rose to US$136 (HK$1,063) after its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> IPO in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US market is also among the most flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong requires every offering to have a retail tranche, US banks can decide whether to sell shares to individual investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, while Hong Kong has a one-week gap between pricing and trading, US shares begin trading the day after they are priced. Both measures help reduce the exposure of companies to US market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class share listing that Hong Kong is expected to introduce has already been offered by many bourses globally for years, including those in the US, Canada, Brazil, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Russia and Finland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1"> opted for a dual-class share structure in its 2004 IPO. Social media company </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1"> took it to an extreme with its US$3.4 billion deal in March 2017 as the first listed company to only issue stock with zero voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such listings, which allow founders of public companies to maintain control of their firms even with minority ownership, have become a favoured tool of tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's unwillingness to provide </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd</span><span class="s1"> with that option largely forced the Chinese e-commerce company to bypass the city for its gigantic US$25.7 billion listing in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bitter loss of Alibaba was a catalyst in a years-long debate over the need for Hong Kong to loosen its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle between Hong Kong and New York for Chinese tech companies' IPOs has intensified as more start-ups have matured and become ready to seek financing through a public offering. The race became more urgent after a number of high-profile companies bypassed Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Ctrip.com</span><span class="s1"> are among the mega Chinese tech companies that have opted for a </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2008, China has been the top source of IPOs by non-American companies in the US; the trend is not expected to slow this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tech has been the biggest sector for Chinese companies listing in the US since at least 2009, according to Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track such data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The country has great tech companies and a strong entrepreneurial culture,” said Bob McCooey, senior vice president of Nasdaq's Listing Services unit. “These founders will be recognised globally when they are listed here [in the US].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early this month, MCooey told the Post that the number of China listings in the US this year was expected to be “materially higher” than a year ago, rising 25 to 30 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hottest American sectors for Chinese IPOs in the year to come will be data centres, streaming businesses, education, life science, wearables and enterprise technology providers, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One high-profile company, Huami, a Chinese maker of wearable devices that has partnered with Xiaomi, went public on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Hong Kong has been losing ground. While US IPOs surged 55 per cent to 174 deals in 2017, Hong Kong saw just a 28 per cent increase, to 149 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">'s December Global IPO Trends report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO growth last year also lagged the 49 per cent average global increase in IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's endeavour to regain IPO market share could hit more bumps as the administration of US President Donald Trump pushes to pare financial regulations to spur economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A top priority for Jay Clayton, the new chief of the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">, the agency responsible for enforcing American securities laws, is to further streamline the IPO process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clayton, a former capital markets lawyer with the New York firm </span><span class="s3">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</span><span class="s1">, advised on Alibaba's IPO. Since taking the SEC's helm in May, Clayton has been actively looking for ways to encourage more companies to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In prepared testimony, Clayton said in June that “fewer companies are choosing to enter the public capital markets than in the past”. The SEC's aim, he said, was “promoting firms' access to capital markets”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July he expanded a programme that allowed all companies seeking to go public to keep their financials private longer, increasing their flexibility in the listing process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street bankers and lawyers have told the Post they believe a further easing of restrictions is on the way. One area being explored is finding ways to shield public companies from potential shareholder litigation, according to people familiar with the discussions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial communities of both Hong Kong and New York are watching closely as a slew of blockbuster IPOs from Chinese technology firms are in line to go public in the next two years, with an estimated total market capitalisation of US$500 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, is talking to banks for its planned listing next year, which could be valued at US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, a financial unit of Alibaba that delayed its 2017 IPO plan, was valued at US$60 billion in its latest funding round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, a Chinese online platform for ordering food and booking movies, and Toutiao, a Chinese news aggregator, are other mega IPOs coming in the next 24 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, when Hong Kong announced its proposed marketplace changes, the move was touted as “the biggest change of the exchange rules since 1993”, when it opened its door for Chinese enterprises to go public there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The emergence of the new economy, particularly in mainland China, is a fantastic catalyst for us to take a closer look at our business and see if we're as competitive and attractive as we can be,” Hong Kong Stock Exchange CEO Charles Li wrote in a blog post last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect companies from the new economy to begin applying for listing under the new rules by the end of June this year,” Li wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early responses have been encouraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This month, smartphone maker Xiaomi was said to favour Hong Kong over New York as the location for its initial stock listing that would be, arguably, this year's most-coveted Chinese tech IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If that happened, Xiaomi, said to be valued at about US$100 billion, would be the first company to take advantage of Hong Kong's newly revamped listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc, a biotech company owned by </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Co, also was reported to be planning a Hong Kong IPO. The offering, expected to occur in the second half of this year, could raise at least US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, Alibaba founder Jack Ma said in January that he would consider listing the company in Hong Kong, during a meeting with city chief Carrie Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong “has made strong progress in attracting more small- and medium-sized companies, a trend that is set to continue,” Terence Ho, Greater China IPO Leader at E&amp;Y wrote in the firm's December report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In particular, it is showing success in turning itself into a listing hub for technology and other ‘new economy' firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's wooing will probably make people think twice about getting listed in New York,E Squared's Funtleyder said,“but the bottom line is, the US continues to have a much deeper market and a really sophisticated investor base.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may be set to its listing rules and introduce the a dual-class share structure in the city, after </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it plans to consult the market on the launch of a third board in an effort to attract more technology and new-economy firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of the agenda is the controversial issue of whether dual shareholding structure should be allowed, said HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Thursday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX consulted the market on a dual shareholding structure two years ago, which would have allowed one class of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eventually the idea foundered, after the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> opposed the proposal due to what is claimed was a lack of sufficient investor protection - a subject which is likely again to dominate discussions this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow poor performers to exit from the new board," Li told a media briefing on Thursday.Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should be [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade. There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow the poor performers to exit from the new boardCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange would be involving the SFC in the consultation process, in an effort to ease their fears last time, and investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will have discussions with the SFC and hope to work out a future direction," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using duel shareholding structures, which are banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request for a shareholder structure, which the commission considered as dual structured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has told the Post that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs or requirements of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse is also planning to launch gold and iron ore contracts this year and a primary connect system aimed at attracting international companies to list in Hong Kong, which could then be offered to mainland investors via the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect links, Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Major international players such as Apple or </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1"> might consider listing in Hong Kong and offering their shares to mainlanders subscribed to a new primary connect system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This will strengthen Hong Kong's listing market and offer more choice for mainland investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in his briefing, Li said the exchange continues to work on reforming the poorly performing Growth Enterprise Market, and is working on a bond connect and one for exchange-traded funds, which again could both be linked to mainland markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outgoing chairman of the Hong Kong stock market operator said his biggest regret during his six-year tenure was the failure to land the initial public share offering in 2014 of Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow Chung-kong, who stepped down as chairman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, said he hoped that reforms to listing rules announced this week would bring big tech firms like Alibaba to the city's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba is a good company. It was a regret during my term to see HKEX lose Alibaba. I hope the listing reform announced on Tuesday will bring eight or 10 companies like Alibaba to list in Hong Kong,” Chow said at his last media briefing after the AGM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to list in the US rather than Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted under rules at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was met with disappointment in Hong Kong and was the spark for the debate over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what it billed as the biggest listing reform to the exchange in 25 years, HKEX said on Tuesday that from next week it would allow companies with dual-class share structures to list. Such structures are favoured by many tech firms because they allow founders and key managers to keep control even if they hold only minority stakes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said that he would count the listing reform as among his three major achievements, alongside HKEX's takeover of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012 and the setting up of the two Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges that allowed cross-border trading of Hong Kong and mainland China equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX has developed from a local stock market to a global exchange with multiple asset classes,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed on Wednesday at 30,328.15, up more than 30 per cent from the 20,677.16 when Chow took office on April 24, 2012. Its market capitalisation has also risen more than 70 per cent in the period to over HK$34 trillion (US$4.3 trillion). Market turnover in the first quarter of this year stood at HK$146.1 billion, compared with average daily turnover of HK$53.9 billion in 2012.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's new board of directors will elect a new chairman at their first meeting on Thursday. The Financial Services Development Council's chairwoman, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, a former vice-chair of market regulator the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, is widely expected to succeed Chow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What I can say is the overall outlook is positive for the new chairman. As China is going to become the world's largest economy, it will need a world class financial centre and Hong Kong has the conditions to play such a role,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among those changes is the introduction of dual-class share listings, which enable company founders, usually of riskier hi-tech and innovative companies, to retain control after going public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If successful, the IPO of the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker will be a much-needed shot in the arm for our long-standing reputation, now under challenge, as the region's premier finance hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city, overtaken by Shanghai last year for the first time in the global IPO stakes, was still smarting over the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba, the parent of the SCMP Group, in New York in 2014, which holds the record as the world's biggest stock sale.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overhaul in listing rules comes as Hong Kong is eager to retake the IPO crown. Beijing-based Xiaomi is seeking to raise US$10 billion, in a sale that values the firm at US$100 billion. This will make the IPO the 15th biggest in the world and the fourth largest in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About a dozen mainland and overseas start-ups have expressed interest in listing in Hong Kong under the new rules. At least two Chinese biotech companies are expected to switch their New York IPOs to Hong Kong to raise a total of around US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which is expected to list in July, is no doubt a real catch for the stock exchange. But authorities should not let it go to their heads. Dual-class share structures deny holders of ordinary shares the same voting rights.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After being snubbed by mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba for its huge initial public offering, the city's financial officials have been engaged in serious soul-searching. As the IPO market is the lifeblood of the Hong Kong stock exchange, it's understandable its bosses want listing rules to be as competitive as those of premier investment hubs like New York and London to attract newcomers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stumbling block has been the long-standing "one share, one vote" rule, from which Alibaba had wanted to be exempted to retain control of its board membership. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> made the right decision not to bend the rule for Alibaba. But it does not mean the rule itself should not be reviewed and changed in future. This is why the exchange is now seeking public views on whether to allow potential listing companies to have special shareholding structures that would have allowed Alibaba to list in Hong Kong rather than New York. The exchange says it is keeping an open mind and does not have a fixed position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation followed proposals made by the Financial Services Development Council, which included changing the rule for the main board or creating new boards for companies, especially hi-tech ones that tend to favour so-called dual-class share structures to retain management control. On the surface, "one share, one vote" seems fair and sensible. In reality, it does not really affect ordinary retail investors, who rarely accumulate a big enough stake in a company to make a difference. Such fights are usually between significant minority shareholders like fund managers and company management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The jury is still out on whether a dual-class structure is good or bad for shareholder returns. </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, Warren Buffett's </span><span class="s3">Berkshire Hathaway</span><span class="s1"> and London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> all have similar such share structures, and their returns speak for themselves. On the other hand, a joint </span><span class="s3">Wharton School</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Harvard Business School</span><span class="s1"> study found that while large ownership stakes in managers' hands tend to strengthen corporate performance, heavy voting control by insiders weakens it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It appears management quality is the key. If investors are buying into such companies, they are placing their trust in their managers for superior returns. Otherwise, they should avoid investing in them. But there is no reason why Hong Kong investors should not have this choice.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma to consider listing Alibaba on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's equity capital markets have put in a strong performance for the first nine months of the year, raising almost 45 per cent more than in the period last year. However, many in the market are still focused on what could have been.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s record-breaking initial public offering in the US this month has added impetus to a push for the city to re-examine whether the stock exchange operator should change its listing rules to enable the kind of dual-class share structure that the e-commerce giant had sought for a Hong Kong listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, companies raised US$40.9 billion in Hong Kong's equity markets in the year to September, including IPOs, follow-on deals and convertible bond offerings, a 44.4 increase from the year-earlier period, according to preliminary data by Thomson Reuters. The nine-month haul represents 88 per cent of the capital raised for all of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Follow-on deals, in which listed companies issue new shares to the public and block trades, dropped 26.5 per cent year on year to US$21.2 billion for the period, despite Citic Pacific raising US$6.9 billion in August for its asset injection deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is undergoing a transitional period in which the Chinese city needs to recover quickly from the loss of Alibaba's flotation, the most important event in recent listing history," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY in Hong Kong. He is keen to see more private-sector listings after most state-owned enterprises - a one-timer pillar of the city's IPO market - have gone public over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised US$25 billion in its New York listing, making it the world's biggest IPO, valuing the firm at about US$250 billion based on the first day's trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate over the way Hong Kong handled Alibaba's proposed listing structure has continued to simmer. On one side are those who argue the city should have shown flexibility in accommodating Alibaba's wish for a dual-class share arrangement. Countering that view are defenders of the status quo who say the exchange was right to not bend its rules for the sake of one company, fearing the consequences for investor protection in the absence of US-style class-action lawsuits. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> began consultations on a rule change at the end of last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong lost Alibaba, it did welcome an influx of mainland private companies listing their shares. These firms are drawn to the city to avoid a cumbersome regulatory approval process at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, a number of these small share sales sparked concerns over the quality of the mainland companies coming to the market. Ding Hui, the chairman of retailer Fujian Nuoqi, went missing after transferring HK$291 million in cash out of the company's accounts, soon after Nuoqi's January IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also suffered the embarrassment of missing out on a wave of Chinese internet companies that bypassed the city for listings in the US. JD.com China's second-largest e-commerce firm, raised US$2 billion in New York, and social network platform Weibo raised US$286 million in a US public offering, partly due again to the dual-class issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation now under way over a change to the listing rules comes as the city's exchange tries to play catch-up with its US counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some market professionals are prepared to look beyond the Alibaba setback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mathias Helleu, chairman of 8 Securities, said: "We do not think sentiment in Hong Kong has been dented after the Alibaba IPO listing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, chief executive of Cathay Conning Asset Management, said: "Missing out on Alibaba IPO only had a very temporary impact on the HK stock market sentiment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">, said economic concerns in China and the US Federal Reserve's plan to end its bond-buying programme could affect the listing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first nine months, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> remained the top performer in the Hong Kong equity capital markets, followed by </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing reforms that would increase the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s power in listing matters are likely to join the list of failed reforms, after they were resoundingly rejected by most of the respondents to a consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals in a joint consultation paper by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the SFC centred on establishing two committees - one for policy and one for regulatory issues - on top of the existing listing committee, with equal representation by the SFC and HKEX, to approve complicated new listings and set listing policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This would upend the current structure whereby HKEX's listing division staff give preliminary approval to a listing and can suggest listing rule changes, which are then submitted to the 28-member listing committee of accountants, lawyers, executives of listed firms and fund managers for final approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposals</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">for fear that the change would allow the SFC to overregulate. As they have in past reforms, the listed companies again led the opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the stiff opposition, the reforms would be difficult to proceed without any modification, and the current deadlock is not a first. Previous failures in the past 15 years have ranged from delisting, quarterly reporting and restrictions on cornerstone investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are the reforms that were proposed and why they failed:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Companies to report results every three months instead of every six months, in line with international practice</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Plan was abandoned one year later after public consultation drew strong opposition from companies, including blue chips such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">. They argued that it would increase costs and prompt the management to chase short-term profits</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Move to delist companies trading below 50 HK cents for a full month</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: HK$10 billion in value was wiped off the market a day after the consultation paper was released as investors rushed to dump penny stocks. HKEX scrapped the public consultation exercise four days later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government accepted an expert group's report on the penny-stock fiasco and decided to shift the listing division and regulatory powers from HKEX to the SFC and remove the conflict of interest of HKEX as a listed company and regulator</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Stiff opposition from companies, brokers and those who feared the change would enable the SFC to become too powerful. The government backtracked and abandoned the plan one month later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government wanted to add part of the listing rules into the law; companies and directors that failed to disclose price-sensitive information could face a maximum 10-year jail term and a fine of HK$10 million</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: With strong opposition from companies and fears of the SFC becoming too powerful, the plan was dropped. In 2010, the government proposed that breaches could be a civil offence with a maximum fine of HK$8 million. The law was supported and enacted in 2013</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce quarterly results reporting in two phases: bigger firms with a market capitalisation of at least HK$10 billion would start in September 2008 while smaller ones would do it in September</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan was dropped after stiff opposition from companies, including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX attempted to restrict tycoons or certain investors from becoming cornerstone investors in initial public offerings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan received stiff opposition from tycoons and investment banks. The regulation has not been tightened and cornerstone investors still have a place in numerous listings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce the British style of quarterly reporting in 2009 where companies give only broad performance outlines. In 2011, it wanted companies to follow the US style of quarterly reporting with more detailed numbers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The proposals were dropped after stiff opposition from the companies including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought to extend the period banning directors from trading shares from two months in a year to up to seven months</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: More than 200 listed companies voiced their opposition with an open letter published in newspapers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought views on whether dual-class share structures should be introduced after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for a listing in New York over Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Mixed views were received. HKEX in June 2015 launched a second round of consultation to allow big companies to have dual-class structures, but SFC banned it a week later. HKEX said it would launch a consultation in the second quarter of 2017 to introduce a third board to attract technology firms and other new economy firms, which would allow dual-class share structure firms to list</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX and the SFC jointly issue a consultation paper to allow SFC to take more front-line role in listing regulation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposal as listed companies, brokers and lawyers generally feared the change would lead the SFC to overregulate and hence hurt the listing market. The SFC and HKEX said they would review the comments before making any consultation</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is on track to lose its much-coveted crown as the world's top initial public offering (IPO) market as the year draws to a close, with latest figures showing total funds raised here have dropped 48 per cent compared with 12 months ago, leaving the city ranked third behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPO funding raised by 67 companies on the main board of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) this year stood at US$12.29 billion as of Wednesday, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">, compared with US$23.72 billion at the same stage of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York's 67 IPOs raised US$28.93 billion and Shanghai saw 197 companies raise US$18.69 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The disappointing Hong Kong result comes even after a recent flurry of new listings in the past two months - but even those failed to turn the tide in its favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has been the top IPO market for the past two years, but a lack of real blockbuster new listings and its failure especially to attract tech firms, have been blamed for getting kicked it off its perch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan has already announced a consultation paper will be launched by HKEX in the first quarter of next year on plans to examine allowing dual class stock listings - a type favoured by many technology or new economy companies - which it hopes will help reverse its fortunes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/06/cdf36ba2-da44-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_161237.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual class stock is the issuing of normally two types of shares by a single company, possibly offering more voting rights or dividend per share than other classes of shareholdings. That is the type favoured by tech giants </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share class might be offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives or family. The class offered to the general public has limited voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides them majority control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is allowed in the US, but has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the world's largest IPO this year raised US$3.91 billion, adopted a dual class shareholding structure for its offering in New York. Its stock exchange had three IPO among the top 10 in the year-to-date, including two hi-tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market, in contrast, is still dominated by "old economy" financial firms, seven of which make up its top 10 largest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> was Hong Kong's largest IPO this year raising HK$16.5 billion (US$2.22 billion), which was also the only domestic listing to squeeze into the global top 10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other more-recent heavyweight HK floats have come from China's largest online car retailer </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (US$866), gaming device maker Razer (US$524m), China Literature (US$1.06b), China's largest online publishing and e-book site, a unit of Tencent, and ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance (US$1.52b), China's first online-only insurer backed by Alibaba affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> .[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs to fight for both old and new economy companies to list here," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for financial services sector who is also a broker, "so as such, we should allow companies with dual class shareholding structure to be listed".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we would need to add in a number of measures to safeguard the interest of investors," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested, for instance, having sunset clauses - regulations that can automatically be abolishing - and possible expiry dates on adopting such a structure. One sunset clause might be the company would have the option to delist, if the founder or key management members were to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norm Champ, a partner at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, and the former director of investment management at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it would be "smart" for</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong to change its listing regime to allow dual class share structures, given the fierce IPO market worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SEC and the </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> are also very keen on getting more companies to list in New York by easing the disclosure regulations," said Champ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the actual number of listed companies in the US has fallen by half over the past two decades as many companies stayed private, or delisted, to escape the expense and scrutiny of being public.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scramble by mainland China's two stock markets to lure foreign-funded technology firms is firmly back on track, as its financial regulators revisit their plan to create a fast track mechanism for share offerings by what many consider will be the profitmaking stars of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this time, their on-off-on-again plan - first revealed way back in 2001 - is set to have greater substance, say commentators, since the leadership is more determined than ever to inject some entrepreneurial vigour into the economy to drive long-term growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will ratchet up the pressure on Hong Kong, as a tug of war over listing resources gradually takes the strain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend it has prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting “unicorns” - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and has already visited to a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invited them to Shanghai, so they can gain first-hand experience (of our facilities and systems),” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are also reaching out to help them overcome difficulties in accessing the capital markets,” it added, without casting a light on any actual names.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's top securities regulators, including chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, confirmed last week too that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's own securities regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), and its stock exchange are also conducting the city's largest listing reforms in decades, aimed at enhancing the bourse's attractiveness to technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June, large biotech companies, for instance, without strong revenue track records as well as more mainstream technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures will be allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That dual-class share structure, will allow shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends, and is favoured by many tech founders as the majority hold minority stakes but still want to maintain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> (which owns the South China Morning Post) chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC quickly recognised the competitive pressures this put the city under in attracting listings by new-economy companies, and threw its weight last December behind its own proposed listing reforms, that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology firms being courted by both exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland have chosen to list A-shares only - yuan-denominated shares bought and traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges - because of the domestic market's higher valuations and the convenience,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expect to this see-saw game between the two markets[Hong Kong and the mainland] intensifying in coming years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, a would-be, fast track listing mechanism proposed to be launched in 2015 was seen as a winning formula which underlined its efforts to set up a dedicated board for emerging industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was put on ice after a summer stock market rout exacerbated regulator worries about a further slide in key economic indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That board was particularly designed to welcome relistings by privatised Chinese tech firms, which had previously traded in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Foxconn Industrial Internet - a unit of the world's largest contract manufacturer whose products include Apple's iPhones - received the go-ahead from the CSRC to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai, just five short weeks after it filed an application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The green light granted to the 27 billion yuan (US$4.27 billion) fundraising was the clearest sign yet that the CSRC is now prioritising technology IPOs as a way of bolstering the country's levels of technical innovation - a key component of the Chinese leadership's attempt to create an economy reliant on slower, but more sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the country's promising start-ups have been backed in the past by foreign private equity and venture capital funds, under the so-called VIE (variable interest entity) structure, and could only list in markets such as Hong Kong and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A VIE structure allows founders and investment funds to set up offshore vehicles which can sign contracts with Chinese firms, giving the latter effective control of the resultant offshore vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To woo VIE firms into an A-share listing, regulators now need to amend securities and corporate laws and revise domestic listing rules, as direct investment in China's A-share market is off-limits to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange says it has already started putting together a blueprint to attract IPOs by foreign companies, particularly “red chips”, or mainland companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, but with controlling Chinese shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Shanghai exchange officials said its fresh initiative to attract technology-leading IPOs has the solid backing of the Chinese leadership, further north in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of their agenda is clearly creating the next generation of tech behemoths on a par with established leaders such as Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, with the full backing of the domestic capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the Shanghai exchange beating its Hong Kong counterpart in terms of value for IPOs for the first time last year, the signs are strong that more investors could well take the bait.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is garnering support towards creating a third board to attract technology start-ups and new economy firms. But safeguards on corporate governance, investor education and transparency in the downside risks are needed to ensure the success of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) has just completed a consultation over the proposed third board, but a second round of consultation on the detailed rules is still needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new third board will offer two markets, one for listing big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, which would open to all investors. The second board is for start-ups which would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main and GEM boards have adopted the one-share one-vote principle in the belief that a dual-class share structure can lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders. Venture capitalists and fund managers also tend to oppose to weighted voting rights as they reduce the price at which they can sell their shares relative to international peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But attitudes of Hong Kong regulators and some market participants are starting to shift, with focus turning to the development of the city's future competitiveness and the appropriate measures to safeguard investors' interests and mitigate governance risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX's proposals strive to address the market quality and risk profile concerns," said Nelson Tang, a partner in the corporate department of </span><span class="s3">Hogan Lovells</span><span class="s1">. "Clearer guidance however from the regulators is needed and a ‘one size fits all' approach should be avoided."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the suggested accelerated delisting regime may allow for quicker enforcement by the stock regulator, which is key to enhancing profitability and corporate governance if listed companies want to maintain their listed status while removing poor performers from the board, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board PRO will restrict access to professional investors only in trading start-ups lacking a financial track record. While this may address concerns that retail investors are perceived to be more vulnerable and less sophisticated, some may argue that a complete ban is an unfair deprivation of an opportunity to invest in these high growth companies. A more flexible approach could be explored by allowing retail investors to participate with additional safeguards in place, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators are also looking at the "primary equity connect" concept, an extended model of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes as an avenue to help with the liquidity of the new and current boards, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marketing and investor education will help make investors savvier when investing in the tech industry, and therefore enhance the appeal for those companies to list in Hong Kong, improving stock liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's proposed third board consultation comes amid the government's promotion on Hong Kong's role in the Lok Ma Chau loop project with Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area integration, which appears to be an effort in developing an innovative culture for education and investment of new economy companies in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Luke Waddington, chief executive of Hong Kong-based fintech Bluepool, says Hong Kong requires a more coherent regulatory framework and bigger government grants to create an innovation technology ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These companies [in Singapore] are on the path towards growing into a large company quickly that eventually aim to IPO. But I don't get the sense that is what has been happening in Hong Kong," Waddington said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He praised Singapore's model as making things much easier for start-ups, citing the ease with which funding can be raised, as well as the ability to exit an investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington added that Singapore has a more coherent regulatory framework designed to get different organisations to come together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore said earlier this year it was seeking public feedback on a suitable regulatory framework to allow the listing of dual-class structures. HKEX invited the public to submit their feedback on the proposed board under a deadline that ended earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore has also announced that it is replicating the UK model, linking the stock regulator with the central bank and businesses so that they can create funding and sandbox mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong has allocated resources to business incubators in Science Park and Cyberport overseen by bureaucrats with little entrepreneurial experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington said a better approach would be to give cash grants directly to entrepreneurs as small companies often struggle to cover the fees to meet licensing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the overall ecosystem can support innovative and new economy companies, then investors will understand why we need a third board and dual-share voting structure," Edward Au, co-leader National Public Offering Group at Deloitte said. "This spirit seems to be starting to develop in Hong Kong now."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji recruited then Hong Kong securities regulator Laura Cha Shih May-lung to help bring order to the mainland's unruly emerging stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seventeen years later, she is now responsible for overseeing implementation of reforms to ensure the local bourse is the No 1 destination for mainland company listings, ahead of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore and New York. Cha, 68, nominated enhancement of the city's competitiveness as her greatest challenge after the board of directors of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> elected her as its chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This reflected the greatest regret of retiring chairman Chow Chung-kong - the failure of the bourse to land the US$25 billion initial public offering of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, now owner of the South China Morning Post, in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba listed in New York because its dual-class share structure was not then accepted in Hong Kong under the principle of one share, one vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This prompted debate culminating in the introduction this week of the biggest listing reforms in 25 years, including the acceptance of applications from companies with dual-class shares, and from biotechnology firms that have no record of generating revenue and therefore would not meet the financial eligibility tests of the main board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a perfect world, the one-share, one-vote principle served Hong Kong well as the exchange developed sound regulatory practices and built a reputation for investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the real world of the new economy, innovation and risk-taking, however, dual-class shares are more attractive to company founders and key executives who want to retain control with minority shareholdings as a company grows and attracts more investor capital.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has edged closer to allowing companies with a dual-class share structure to list on the stock exchange after the regulator backed plans for a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) said on Thursday it supported the local bourse's proposed consultation exercise this quarter to gauge opinion on creating a third board aimed at technology start-ups and ‘new economy' firms.There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board would for the first time permit dual-share listings, which afford one class of shareholder more rights than others. Their long-standing ban in Hong Kong is widely seen as a barrier to potentially lucrative initial public offerings, particularly by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's decision to back the move represents a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it considered the proposal at the time did not carry sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January suggested launching a new third board with more relaxed listing rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board aims to attract three types of entity - infrastructure companies, start-ups and dual-shareholding firms. Li said on Wednesday the consultation paper would be ready soon for SFC approval before it is launched this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC supports the consultation to allow the public to share their views on the dual-shareholding structure," said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC at a media lunch on Thursday. "The SFC will be open minded to listen to the market comments. However, the regulator will only agree with any listing rule changes if it would develop the market and provide sufficient investor protection measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC took a different attitude to the consultation this time around because the dual shareholding companies would only be listed on the third board. Two years ago, the proposed changes would have applied to companies listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also need to consider the worldwide trend," he said. Singapore's stock exchange last October said it planned to consult the market on allowing dual shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using a dual-class structure, which is permitted in the United States. It is favoured by many start-ups because their founders often hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to allow such listings on the grounds that they would violate the long-held principle of "one share, one vote".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request to allow what it considered a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has since said that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs of new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players have mixed views on the issue, with listed firms and investment bankers preferring a dual-share structure while fund managers generally oppose it as they believe it is not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needs," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, who support the dual-share proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the third board consultation should be accompanied by a review of the role of the GEM, Hong Kong's second board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999 with the intention to attract technology firms to list, but it has failed to do so, now acting only as a stepping stone for smaller firms while they wait to grow big enough to move to the main board. Many new listings on the GEM have seen their share prices fluctuate wildly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After setting up the third board, we need to find a new role for GEM. Many companies only take GEM as a short cut to list on the main board. We need to make changes to address the problems of this market," Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose to close at 31,904.75, surpassing the record previously set on October 30, 2007.

The HSI is now also only 53 points from reaching an intraday record high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The record close came after HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia unveiled a reform to listing rules that will allow large biotechnology companies without revenue and other new-economy firms to apply to list their dual-class shares in Hong Kong from the end of June.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi staged a dramatic turnaround on its second day of trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's market capitalisation surged to HK$425 billion (US$54.2 billion), breaking into Hong Kong's top 10 companies, after the stock was added to widely tracked the FTSE China A50 Index, and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect schemes as soon as this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure quickly rebounded on Tuesday to as much as HK$19.34. It closed at HK$19. On its debut on Monday, it fell 1.2 per cent below the offer price of HK$17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The turnaround was quite surprising as it was just the second day of trading and the fundamental has not changed at all,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “It's mainly due to short-term capital inflows, after it was added to FTSE and HSCI indexes, prompting some funds to chase it before the additions take effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yip said the FTSE China A50 Index is tracked by many passive ETFs, which means they will have to rebalance their portfolios to accommodate the change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share surge has helped Xiaomi break into Hong Kong's top 10 most valuable listed companies, a league that includes </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, AIA, and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">. Xiaomi ranks No 9 at its current market cap, ahead of </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading volumes also soared, with more than HK$9.8 billion worth of shares changing hands on Tuesday, 27 per cent higher than the HK$7.7 billion on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change in fortunes came after index compiler FTSE Russell announced that it would include Xiaomi in a number of its indexes with effect from July 16, including FTSE China A50 Index, which is tracked by nearly US$7 billion worth of funds globally. Consequently, it will remove US sanctions-hit ZTE from the FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday afternoon, the Hang Seng Indexes Company also said that it would add Xiaomi to the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) with effect from July 23. The HSCI family has more than 400 constituents, covering over 90 per cent of Hong Kong stock exchange's market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a constituent of the HSCI, mainland investors will be able to buy Xiaomi shares via the Stock Connect programme, provided Chinese authorities grant approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macquarie, which issued a research report on Monday, set Xiaomi's target price at HK$30, as it expects the company's earnings per share to post a compound annual growth rate of 40 per cent between 2018 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank's analysts said Xiaomi can monetise its large number of active users via various internet services, such as online games, apps, ads, which could be its biggest strength compared to its peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company can benefit from rising profit margins in internet services business for the next three years and its continued smartphone sales growth in India, Europe, and Chinese markets, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi has 190 million monthly active users for its mobile operating platform, according to the company's founder and CEO Lei Jun.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi fell below its offer price on Monday, after its much-anticipated IPO received a lukewarm response amid a weak market, as the company's categorisation of “internet firm” and valuation sparked a close examination by investors and regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Index compiler MSCI said last week it will not add Xiaomi to its benchmark index because the company does not meet the criteria due to its weighted voting rights (WVR) structure. WVR, also called dual-class shares, allows a company's founders or executives to have control even if they have minority shareholding.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When a long-held principle no longer reflects the investment reality of new-economy companies, regulators may be forgiven to want to loosen the rules. Companies with different classes of shares may be allowed to list on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange by the middle of next year under a new pilot scheme. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> has had a change of heart about the sacred principle of "one share, one vote", established as a cardinal rule of share ownership in Hong Kong since at least the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A consensus has also emerged among the commission, the government and the stock exchange that it is not necessary to create a new board for listing such companies. Hong Kong has been facing intense competition from rival bourses in such places as New York, Singapore and Shanghai, which have long allowed listed companies to hold dual-class share ownerships. Such share structures enable company founders and/or the management to exercise strategic control even if they don't own a majority stake. Many new-economy and bio-tech companies favour such arrangements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Hong Kong still insists on "one share, one vote", it will be in danger of losing out on the highly lucrative market for initial public offerings. It has lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for IPOs this year, having fallen behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first half of the year, the city's stock market raised just US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, down 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised during the same period last year, when it was ranked as the world's top market for new listings. Indeed, it is still smarting over the IPO of Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] Group Holding, the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post, which skipped the Hong Kong bourse in favour of staging its record US$25 billion flotation in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the new scheme, some start-ups that have reached valuations of over US$1 billion will be allowed to raise capital on the main board. But there will be protection provisions that may include a sunset clause forcing such companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They will also list with a special code to distinguish them from more traditional companies, to help investors identify potential risks. The scheme may expand if enough high-quality companies are attracted to list in Hong Kong without regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The commission's U-turn is welcome. People ought to be able to invest in promising companies with dual shares, provided they know what they are getting into. Transparency is key.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global institutional investors are urging Hong Kong not to change its listing rules even after losing the mega listing of e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to a survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those surveyed, 54 global institutional investors managing a combined US$14 trillion of assets, warned they would on average give a 19 per cent price discount to Alibaba's valuation if it lists with its special shareholders structure intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They also said they would on average put a 13 per cent discount on the Hong Kong market valuation if the city allows a non-standard shareholder structure to accommodate Alibaba-like listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong government and regulators should do nothing with the existing listing rules. The one-share-one-vote principle in Hong Kong has worked well for many years, providing all shareholders with fair treatment," said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the association, which has 100 global institutional investor members including some of the world's largest fund houses, pension funds and insurers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey, conducted on association members early this year, came after Alibaba was reported in October to be in talks with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange refused to grant the exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle. Alibaba last month said it planned to list in the US, which allows the dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba lists with the structure, 71 per cent of respondents said they would not buy the stock or buy it at a discount ranging from 5 to 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia has written several times on his blog since September on the need to relook at listing rules for "innovative" companies, but institutional investors are opposed to any change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Twenty-eight per cent of the respondents gave a "bad" rating to HKEx in its manner of handling Alibaba, compared with 2 per cent "bad" each for the SFC and the government. In comparison, 41 per cent ranked the SFC "good" in its handling of the Alibaba issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Cheng, the association's research director of mainland China and Hong Kong, said some years ago London had allowed the dual class structure but that did not lead to more listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Chan, finance partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Berwin Leighton Paisner</span><span class="s1">, said: "In the US, there is a more disclosure-oriented approach as well as a culture of litigation. Investors don't need the exchanges to protect them as much as they do in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's top destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) during the first quarter, as an absence of blockbuster listings allowed the city to be overtaken by New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sixteen companies chose to list their shares in Hong Kong in the first quarter, raising US$1.5 billion of capital, far behind the 14 IPOs in New York with US$9.6 billion raised. New York's haul was bolstered by </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">'s US$3.9 billion IPO in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai ranked second, with US$4.8 billion, while Shenzhen's ChiNext exchange ranked third with US$2.2 billion raised from technology companies and startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There wasn't any big IPOs in the first quarter, while the HKEX and the Securities &amp; Futures Commission tightened their approval procedures of new listings in both the Growth Enterprise Market and the main board,” said Joseph Tang Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The drop in ranking, as well as the reduced fee income that follows, puts pressure on HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to quicken the process for establishing a third board in Hong Kong, with a more relaxed set of rules including the possibility of dual-class shares, to attract technology companies to raise capital here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the Hong Kong securities watchdog had been conducting a process of public consultations since last year, obtaining public feedback on the best way to change the city's listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook Inc</span><span class="s1"> and Snap adopt dual-class share structures, banned in Hong Kong, but allowed in other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1"> chose New York for its US$25 billion IPO in 2014, catapulting America's financial centre to the top of </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' global ranking that year. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's capital-raising rules are outdated, more suitable for traditional companies like property developers instead of technology and fintech companies, Alibaba's chairman Jack Ma said last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first-quarter total equity funds raised, including IPOs, share placements and rights issues, dropped 26.6 per cent to an 11-year low of US$5.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should study how to relax its listing rules to attract more my firms to raise their capital here,” Tong said. “Otherwise the local IPO market will wither.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local stockbrokerages and banks are jockeying to attract business from retail investors seeking to get in on the share sale by smartphone maker Xiaomi this week, rolling out special discounts and fee waivers tied to the subscription drive for the US$6.1 billion IPO, the largest of its kind globally for two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Individual retail investors can become owners in the company for as little as HK$4,444.33 (US$566.32), representing a single lot of 200 Xiaomi shares, available during the subscription period which runs from Monday until Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks and brokers could be the biggest winners from the blockbuster offering. The Xiaomi initial public offering [IPO] could bring in commission income of HK$479.3 million among the more than 500 stockbrokers and banks involved, based on the assumption that they receive an average 1 per cent of commission and that the offering prices at the top end, raising HK$47.93 billion (US$6.1 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial firms also stand to benefit from interest payments from investors who borrow on margin to subscribe to the IPO.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For many stockbrokers and banks, the Xiaomi IPO would be a chance to earn a good commission and margin lending. They could also get new customers from the blockbuster IPO,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector who is also a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, my brokerage firm has not received many enquiries from investors about the IPO. This may be because the overall stock market sentiment last week was not good due to the worries over the trade dispute between the US and China. The valuation of Xiaomi is also very aggressive. Investors need to beware of the risks involved in the IPO,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi could raise up to HK$47.93 billion by offering 2.2 billion shares to global investors this week</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">at an indicative price range between HK$17 and HK$22 each. The company will be the first to list in Hong Kong under new rules that permit the dual-class shareholding structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) is working closely with both Hong Kong and mainland regulators on further moves to try to connect mainland and foreign investors with each other, Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, told an audience at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Securities Institute</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companies,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to his plans, HKEX is considering the creation of what's being dubbed “Primary Connect” - a programme which would allow mainlanders to subscribe for new shares listing in Hong Kong, which in turn will hopefully attract more international firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He refused to give any further details or a timetable on this latest “Connect” initiative, and declined to confirm if those international companies already listed in New York or London, would be able to make secondary listings or secondary share placements via the proposed plan.Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companiesCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange already has two “Stock Connects” in place with their counterparts in Shanghai and Shenzhen, allowed cross trading of shares between the exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also kicked off its “Bond Connect” programme in July which allows mainland Chinese bonds to be traded by international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This [new plan] still needs a lot of parties to discuss the details. What I can say is this new Primary Connect will benefit both the Hong Kong and mainland markets,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li and HKEX have already prioritised their desire to increase the number of major international players listing in Hong Kong, as well as helping more mainlanders to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major exchanges around the world, including Hong Kong, are licking their lips especially, over the prospects of hosting the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of energy giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, expected to be the largest IPO ever when it floats in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market is the third largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation but it is dominated by mainland companies, which take up 60 per cent of its total value with the rest predominantly Hong Kong companies, and a few international listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, say they are working flatout together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for foreign firms, especially new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed the consultation for a plan to launch a new board, referred to as the “third board”, for dual class shares companies or those newly start-ups without profit to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe for Hong Kong to be a serious contender to land the Aramco IPO, or any other major multinational IPO for that matter, regulators would need to design the planned Primary Connect in a way to allow foreign listed firms to have secondary listings or placements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also needs more diversify in its mix of constituent company listings, argue brokers, illustrated well with the fact that 56 per cent of the funds raised in the first half were by financial firms, and less than one per cent from new economy or technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments we have received so far show there is a consensus that Hong Kong cannot afford to miss any opportunities to act as a fundraising hub for new economy firms,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said it would still need a second round of consultation on the details of the new third board before it could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board is proposed to contain two markets - one is for big companies with dual share structure for all investors to trade and another is for start-ups for professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many commentators consider the planned start-up market is a risky tactic, while others think dual-class share companies should be more encouraged to list on the main board, rather than the planned new one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said the bourse could also opt for what he termed a “landing zone” approach to make some change to the proposal regarding the third board plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To the millions of mainland investors frolicking in China's go-go stock market of the early 2000s, given a kick start from the country's membership in the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">, Laura Cha Shih May-lung was the killer regulator anointed by Beijing to crash the party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, whose married name rhymes with the Chinese word for inspection, soon earned the moniker of the regulator who would “inspect miscreants to their death”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though her tenure as a vice-chairman at the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">from 2001 to 2004 drew mixed responses, it earned her a place in the history of China's capital market development - the first Hongkonger and non-mainlander to take on a vice-ministerial position within the central government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week, the 68-year-old grandmother of three was elected unopposed as the first woman to chair </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the operator of the stock market, in the bourse's 127 years of history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha's ascent comes at a critical time. The exchange is striving to strengthen its relevance and position as the go-to market for mainland companies in the face of increasing competition from global and regional exchanges, as well as China's Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Increasing integration of the Hong Kong and mainland markets, pinned by the city's Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges since 2014 and 2016, makes China a partner but also a rival as the latter wants to bring home some its biggest overseas-listed companies through depositary receipt issuance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) are instituting much-needed listing reforms to entice new economy firms, particularly technology and biotech ones from the mainland, while cleaning up irregularities and excesses.Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to playLaura Cha</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they are also increasing their collaboration with the CSRC to crack down on cross-border frauds, including going after what Beijing calls “big crocodiles”, or wealthy corrupt mainland businessmen who manipulate the capital markets for illegal gains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means Cha has one big balancing act to tackle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pointing to her previous roles at the SFC and the CSRC and now with HKEX, Cha argued that they all differed but did not conflict, as each institution worked towards the common objective of ensuring that Hong Kong's financial markets grew robustly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to play,” she said on Thursday at a media briefing after she was elected chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha also said she would draw on her CSRC experience and mainland network to enhance communication between Hong Kong and China and foster stronger cross-border cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In fact, the cross-border cooperation has never stopped since the launch of H shares 25 years ago,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, Cha has made mapping a three-year strategic plan one of her top priorities in the first 100 days in office, to look at how to enhance the exchange's competitiveness from 2019 to 2021 and fend off competition from other overseas exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/9092235e-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the Hong Kong stock market gained 36 per cent last year, it lost its initial public offering (IPO) crown, which it held for the prior two years, to New York, as IPO value dropped to its lowest since 2012. The loss was in part due to the ban on allowing companies with dual-class shareholding structures, commonly preferred by tech firms, to list since the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To regain the sweet spot, HKEX officials, with the SFC's support, have proposed to lift that ban on Monday, under new rules that would also allow biotech firms without revenue to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Long-time rival exchange Singapore also announced in January that it was allowing dual-class share firms, in line with the global trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Needless to say, the job facing Cha is anything but easy, as she will have to oversee one of the exchange's most crucial turning points in its more than a century history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha's major challenge as HKEX's new chairman is the listing reform. Although the HKEX has announced the new rules, the new listing regime has yet to be tested. The challenge for her is to make sure the regime will be implemented smoothly and to attract many new economy companies to list here,” said Bonnie Chan, a partner at law firm Davis Polk. Chan has worked with Cha since 2013 as a council and committee member of the Financial Services Development Council, the government's advisory body on financial issues that Cha still heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“She has strong leadership and is capable of drawing on a pool of professional talent to work for the council … We could not have done so much work without Cha's ability to draw the many professionals to voluntarily do the job,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said she would step down from the council once the government had found a replacement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the council, Cha, a career financial regulator, had served on the HKEX board from 2006 to 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/8b50afb4-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha had a relative late start to her career to focus on bringing up her two children and being a full-time housewife for six years in the US where she then lived.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was so hard to get help in the US, and as a mother of two I had to be a full-time housewife. I only started my career after my children went to school,” she had said in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was during that period that she became interested in law and returned to school to read law. She qualified as a lawyer in the US before returning to Hong Kong in 1985, when her businessman husband Victor Cha Mou-zing was called back to run the family business, </span><span class="s3">HKR International</span><span class="s1">, the developer of Discovery Bay on Lantau Island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha went to work at a law firm before joining the SFC in 1991, where she stayed till former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji invited her to join the CSRC in 2001. During the decade to 2000, the HKEX and the SFC had garnered extensive experience and expertise in bringing Chinese state firms to market and instilling corporate governance in the process, while weathering the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's stock markets, created in the 1990s with the aim of raising funds for ailing state-owned companies, have long been plagued by insider trading and illicit deals. Wu Jinglian, a renowned Chinese economist, once described the market as a “casino”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha was paid up to 5 million yuan (US$790,557 at current rates) for her CSRC role, in a specially-approved remuneration package that was several times more than what even the Chinese president was earning, according to mainland Chinese media. She took the equivalent salary of her fellow deputy regulators, and donated the remainder of the pay to a fund for educating Chinese regulators, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Cha struggled to implant mature, Hong Kong-style regulatory practises in the mainland to weed out rampant insider trading in the three years she was at the CSRC, as they would have ruffled vested interests. Changing China's broader political, economic and legal framework remains a tall order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But many Chinese investors would hold her as “Hong Kong's iron lady” who helped drive mainland stocks to a three-year bear market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/96617ac8-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We knew of her as the ‘iron lady',” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai who has been tracking China's stock market since 1998.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not fair to blame the bear market on her, maybe it was a coincidence. No one is powerful enough to let the market rise and the purpose of getting her here then was to strengthen market oversight, not to create a bull market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha returned to Hong Kong after her stint at the CSRC, and has been a member since 2004 of the Executive Council, or cabinet, of all four of the city's chief executives: Tung Chee-hwa, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, Leung Chun-ying and incumbent Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While her return to lead the HKEX has been met with positive responses by her supporters and the exchange's chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, who was recruited nine years ago by a panel that Cha led, her work would inevitably be pitted against predecessor Chow Chung-kwong. In his six years as chairman - the maximum term for any government-appointed director - Chow oversaw the acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and the launch of the Stock Connect programmes.Cha's major challenge as HKEX's the new chairman is the listing reformBonnie Chan, Davis Polk</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said she might struggle to understand the needs of smaller players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha was a former SFC head and she has a regulatory mindset. She does not understand the difficulty that many of the 500 local players have in competing with international big players,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker representing the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope Cha would focus more on promoting the financial services industry in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever the challenges, Cha is seen likely to rise above them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ermanno Pascutto, who recruited Cha to the SFC and is now director of the Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights, described her as “very adept” at dealing with senior leaders and executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Laura is the sort of person you could send to New York, Beijing or to talk to Legco [Legislative Council] and she would do a creditable job in all of them,” Pascutto said an earlier interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are few people who could pull that off.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More Chinese fintech firms vying to go public could choose Hong Kong as their listing venue, after the city's first fintech IPO received a hot response from investors, and that Hong Kong has unique advantages compared with other global financial hubs, said </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> 's head of global investment banking in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, closed nine per cent up from its IPO price on Thursday in its Hong Kong debut. With an oversubscription of nearly 400 times from retail investors, the company had priced its IPO at the top end of the expected range, raising US$1.5 billion in the city's biggest ever fintech offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and CMB International are joint sponsors of the deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Houston Huang, head of </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> 's global investment banking in China, expected the IPO to mark the beginning of more fintech companies seeking a listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A good fintech IPO will have a ‘push effect' on other Chinese fintech players, prompting them to consider linking with the capital market to raise fund," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The next Zhong An could show up in online payment, P2P lending, [financial] product distribution, or online insurance."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang expected China's fintech industry to expand fast in the next few years, due to the rapid spread of mobile technology and the application of artificial intelligence.A good fintech IPO will have a ‘push effect' on other Chinese fintech players, prompting them to consider linking with the capital market to raise fundHouston Huang, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology is driving revolutionary progress in China, " he said. "Fintech is an untapped market, with great growth potentials."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's fintech market could grow to 460 billion yuan (US$69 billion) in revenue by 2020, with a 44 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from 2016 to 2020, according to a recent research note from </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, revenue from online payment is estimated to increase to 202 billion yuan by 2020. Revenue from online distribution of financial products could grow to 52 billion yuan by then, while that for online lending and online insurance may reach 142 billion yuan and 60 billion yuan respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, companies seeking an IPO have to show profit in three consecutive years leading up to the application year, among other regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rules about profitability are less stringent in the US and Hong Kong, which gives the city advantages as described by Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also has other strengths, such as its proximity to the mainland market, the Stock Connect schemes that allow mainland investors to directly trade Hong Kong stocks, and comparably lower listing costs than the US, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Zhong An IPO may prompt structural changes in Hong Kong's capital market, which is trying to reduce its reliance on traditional sectors, such as real estate, financial services and energy, and increase the technology component.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given the strong response received for the Zhong An IPO, investors' knowledge and understanding about fintech had also grown, which could make it easier for future fintech companies to gain a reasonable valuation, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia's booming technology landscape will become large enough for more than one stock exchange to cater for future initial public offerings (IPOs), according to the chief of Singapore's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector's explosion in the region has had leading regional and global exchanges vying for more tech listings, including Hong Kong, long seen as Singapore's arch rival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asian tech listings are in some ways, a new space,” said Loh Boon Chye, chief executive officer of the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yet no exchange has been able to establish a lead position. Being a new space means there is room enough for a few players; each can take its own track.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/17/183aa842-faa2-11e7-b2f7-03450b80c791_image_hires_205109.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX considers technology - which includes telcos and media firms - among its priority sectors, with 76 technology firms listed already in Singapore, with a combined market capitalisation of US$64 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of the month, South Korea's top mobile messenger operator Kakao Corp will list its global depositary receipts on the exchange, raising US$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh claims Singapore's edge lies in its “strong technology eco-system”, pillared by a supportive government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore offers plenty of government initiatives and grants, led by the </span><span class="s3">National Research Foundation</span><span class="s1"> and official agencies, such as the </span><span class="s3">Media Development Authority</span><span class="s1"> and statutory boards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Startup Genome, the city state ranked 12th in the top 20 list of the world's start-up eco-systems in 2017, down two places from the previous year. Hong Kong wasn't even ranked, but Beijing and Shanghai are new entrants, at fourth and eighth respectively.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, heavy government backing can also work against entrepreneurship and commercialisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent survey of Singapore start-ups by the National University of Singapore's Entrepreneurship Centre found that while more than half of the tech firms survived past five years in business, they were still generating little growth or employment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 8.1 per cent of the 530 tech start-ups surveyed were considered “gazelles” - or high-growth firms that are increasing its revenue by 20 per cent annually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX, however, insists that government support is not its only edge over rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, it signed an agreement with the US's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> that will allow concurrent and sequential listings on both exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh calls that his “east-west corridor”, and that it's part of a wider strategy to draw more tech firms and start-up firms to list in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He dismissed, however, suggestions by the local media that Singapore simply provides a stepping stone to Asian firms who ultimately want to go public in the US, but have yet to qualify.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One can argue that it's easier to explain tech to investors outside the region, but you can also argue that you need to be able to explain Asia or Southeast Asia to investors from outside Asia,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The crux often lies in helping investors understand Asian business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Understanding how your model fits into distributing in Asia is equally important. You could then, because you are already Asian-focused, list on SGX first,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX is looking at prospects jointly with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, but Loh declined to give details or pin down a time when any debut listing might happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange's engagement with techs and start-ups has also spilled into taking private stakes in some promising prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX subsidiary </span><span class="s3">Asian Gateway Investments</span><span class="s1"> last October took a 10 per cent share in Capbridge, a Singapore-based capital-raising platform it helped create in 2015, with a S$1.5 million (US$1.13 million) grant over three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will help companies tap series B funding upwards, allowing them access lists of investors,” Loh said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange proposed revamping its listing rules last month to accommodate dual-class shareholding companies and biotech firms, without strong records of profitability, to avoid losing out on more IPOs by techs and new economy giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share firms must be worth at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) and have annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies with market caps of HK$10 billion or more that are already listed elsewhere will be eligible for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under their existing shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech firms would be able to list if their expected minimum capitalisation topped HK$1.5 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's initial public offering market continued to decline in the first quarter, as the total capital raising was down 26 per cent on year, sending the city down the rankings to the No 3 spot globally, behind New York and Frankfurt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s main board and the Growth Enterprise Market saw a combined</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a Hong Kong lawmakers for financial services sector, said the low IPO number in the first quarter was a result of the consultation of the listing reform at HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aberdeen Standard leads calls for more investor protection within HKEX's proposed listing reforms[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2136796/fund-managers-call-more-investor-protection-hkexs-proposed]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many listing hopefuls are holding up their listing plans in the first quarter. This is because the HKEX has released this listing reform consultation in February and the companies want to wait until the change of the listing rules before they apply for listing. After the rule change is settled in April, we will see more large IPOs,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung said Hong Kong is likely to face heated competition as mainland China also wants to introduce similar changes to attract overseas-listed companies to host Chinese depository receipts in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But Hong Kong could still compete as it is an international centre and has no capital controls. In comparison, China still has capital control and has not yet fully opened to western investors,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said last week that Hong Kong and the two mainland bourses were not direct competitors. The mainland tech giants can list as H share and A shares together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange has set a goal of overtaking New York's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology companies and their market capitalisation, according to HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The declining trend came after funds raised at IPO in Hong Kong in 2017 fell 45 per cent to US$13.87 billion, the lowest level since 2012, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lack of big tech-related stocks and other blockbuster capital raising are among the reasons Hong Kong lost its global IPO market crown - a title it retained in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, the city slid to the No 3 spot globally for IPOs, overtaken by New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last Friday marked the deadline for a market consultation on the proposed rule changes to allow large tech companies with dual-class shares structure and biotech firms that have yet to generate any revenue to list in the city, possibly as early as April. These dual class share structures are favoured by technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or Alphabet as they enable founders to maintain control of the company even though they only hold a minority of the listed shares</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/26/64f17ce4-3033-11e8-aca1-e0fd24c4b573_image_hires_092253.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are several unicorns such as Lufax and Xiaomi which are expected to list in Hong Kong after the listing reform. These could boost the city's competitiveness as a listing destination for new economy giants. This would also help Hong Kong to climb back to the top of the IPO market worldwide again,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 2.8 per cent of IPO funds raised in Hong Kong in the first quarter are from high technology firms, compared with real estate companies which represented 39 per cent, and financial companies at 30 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked No 1 with 16 companies raising US$10.35 billion in the first quarter, thanks to success in attracting listing among top tech firms and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, which is more focus on technology, ranked as the fourth largest IPO market while it may challenge Hong Kong for third place amid pending listings by big players such as Chinese Netflix iQiyi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which was not among the top IPO markets in 2017, ranked second in the first quarter as the </span><span class="s3">Instone Real Estate Group</span><span class="s1"> listing in February raised US$1.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai declined to fifth in the first quarter from third last year, while Shenzhen's small and medium sized market ranked sixth. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen are mulling rules change to attract technology firms to list which would post competition with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong relies heavily on Chinese companies in its IPO market. In the first quarter, Chinese companies represents 79 per cent of all fund raised. China's Bank of Gansu is the largest IPO in the three month period in Hong Kong, raising US$900.7 million (HK$7 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nasper, the majority shareholder in </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, last week sold shares in the company worth</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HK$76.94 billion, which is the largest deal in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This brought total equity capital markets activities in the first quarter to a record US$20.3 billion, up 150 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> ranked top of bankers in all types of equity capital market underwriting, capturing a 23 per cent market share with US$4.7 billion in related proceeds.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now that the dust has settled on whether the Hong Kong stock exchange should grant Alibaba a special waiver to list dual-class shares, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia is stirring up the issue again. He kicks off his latest blog with: "Now that Alibaba has gradually faded from media attention, maybe our market can finally have a more rational and open discussion about weighted voting rights and our future competitiveness." The implication here is that the previous discussion, which resulted in Alibaba deciding to list in the United States rather than in Hong Kong, was somehow irrational.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li takes issue with the "one share, one vote principle" which he seems to think has wrongly been seen as the Hong Kong market's "core value". This, he argues, is not universally applied and ironically takes the case of HKEx which, although a listed company, the government gets to elect six of the 12 board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, Li thinks that rule of law and due process are the market's core values. They dictate that "we must not change our rules haphazardly for a single company and any significant change would need to go through due process. But on the other hand, due process does not dictate refusal to debate the future of our market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You can see where he is going with this. He makes the point that dual listings are permitted in the US, saying, "It is difficult to conclude that US regulators chose to allow the dual-class share regimes because they do not care about investor protection. The success to date by firms like </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> makes it difficult for us to conclude that US investors have lost out as a result of such structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share, one vote, he says, has a nice ring to it and, "if we only care about reputation, this approach will certainly help to maintain Hong Kong's nominal regularity purity". The corollary of being overly concerned with what he calls "regulatory purity" and persisting with a ban on dual shares is that China's technology and new economy companies will list in the US rather than Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If this becomes a trend, Hong Kong could lose a huge franchise for good, " he says, getting to the meat of his argument. This of course hurts competitiveness, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So for all the chat about having a rational debate, Li's discourse does not take the discussion any further and is a restatement of the view that if Hong Kong sticks to one share, one vote - this will affect the Hong Kong market's "competitive" position and will result in the loss of new China listings to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One aspect of the discussion he neatly avoids is that in the US, investors can use the class action system to obtain legal redress. This is not available in Hong Kong where the cost of legal action is usually not worth it. This is a huge difference which Li does not address. There is also the question of whether Li or the HKEx is the right body to be initiating this discussion. It has a huge vested interest in this matter, and as such is deeply conflicted. It's not unlike having a rabbit in charge of the lettuce patch. This topic shows no sign of going away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In harm's way</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jim Walker's Asianomics has come out with a cheery report that says Hong Kong's current positive economic demeanour is masking the tell-tale signs of a sharp and possibly unprecedented correction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is in the path of a typhoon developing on the mainland," Sharmila Whelan, an analyst with Asianomics, told The Telegraph. "A nasty downturn in China and a sudden sharp correction in the Hong Kong property market would severely buffet the territory's economy. China's problems have become insurmountable and the likelihood that 2014 will prove the year of reckoning is growing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The problem lies in the banking system, according to the report. Before the financial crisis, China had never represented more than 10 per cent of total external claims. Post-crisis, there has been a dramatic shift, with Hong Kong financial institutions' exposure to the mainland rising to 49 per cent. Much of this is from the offshore units of big mainland banks, which have been using the city as a base for sourcing foreign funding that is re-lent in the domestic economy. A real estate crisis on the mainland would have a serious impact on Hong Kong bank balance sheets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange will face mounting competition from Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, as speedier listing approval process and strong demand from investors expected next year will help them to extend their top rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its annual IPO review and outlook for 2018, EY laid out the prediction based on the number of IPOs and proceeds raised this year - 436 companies mopped up 230.4 billion yuan (US$35.1 billion) from the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These represent an increase of 92 per cent in number and 53 per cent in proceeds compared to 2016, and make the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges the top two respectively in number of IPOs completed this year. Hong Kong was ranked third, with a total of 160 IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in terms of proceeds raised, the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked top in 2017, with US$39.5 billion, followed by Shanghai at US$20.9 billion; and Hong Kong at US$16.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the number of A-share IPOs reached a record high, a lack of IPO that raised over 5 billion yuan per deal also means that all these IPOs' proceeds raised combined was just 47 per cent the total amount raised in 2010, which was the second biggest year for IPOs in numbers at 347.There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listedRingo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, “there were 508 companies [as of December 22] waiting in the pipeline to have their IPOs approved by the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">,” said Ringo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY. “There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said the A-share IPO market became more “normalised” as 2017 progressed, with an average of 30-40 IPOs completed per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, a record 160 IPOs were completed, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Combined they raised HK$128.2 billion (US$16.5 billion), down however by 34 per cent from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to EY, a lack of large IPOs also squeezed total funds raised in Hong Kong. But more significantly, a record 80 companies got listed on GEM board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bullish performance of the Hang Seng Index, which has gained 34 per cent this year and ranked first among major indices including </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Dow Jones Industrial Average, has benefited the IPO market, Choi said, adding that 28 overseas companies were also attracted to list in Hong Kong, the highest in six years, raising a total of HK$10.02 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“New listing rules to be introduced in 2018 for allowing listing of dual-class share structure on the main board; and the proposal to increase the minimum expected market capitalisation of main board applicants to HK$500 million from HK$200 million are all positive for the Hong Kong IPO market for the first half,” Choi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, for the second half he was more cautious. Apart from uncertainty about whether investors would still continue to favour equities like they did in 2017, Choi noted competition from the two exchanges in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expected that as A-share IPO vetting process accelerates with simpler approval procedures, this might erode the attraction of the Hong Kong bourse as these companies might opt for a listing on the mainland because of the attractive pricing levels that can be achieved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For 2018, he expects IPOs in Hong Kong to raise HK$150 billion, but a mega IPO, such as that by listing hopeful Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco, will bring the total to over HK$200 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next stop after the stock "through train" scheme could be commodities as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> looks towards tie-ups with mainland futures exchanges after the proposed collaboration with the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We'll need to focus on working out the details in establishing our link with the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in the next few months. In future, it would be possible for us to have more tie-ups with other mainland exchanges. We are not ruling out similar linkages with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> or futures exchanges across the border," HKEx chairman Chow Chung-kong said after the annual general meeting of the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and mainland regulators last week announced a through-train scheme to begin in October that will allow investors from the city and the mainland to cross-trade stocks listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong up to a quota of 550 billion yuan (HK$691 billion). The quota has no time frame and Beijing has not said if it will replenish the quota after it runs out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx and the Shanghai exchange will soon sign the agreement. Under it, mainland investors looking to trade Hong Kong stocks can do so through mainland brokers, who will place the orders at the Shanghai exchange that will then be passed on to the HKEx. Those in Hong Kong investing in mainland stocks will do the reverse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors can trade up to 10.5 billion yuan of Hong Kong stocks a day, or 250 billion yuan in total, while Hong Kong investors can trade up to 13 billion yuan of Shanghai stocks a day, up to 300 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the HKEx annual general meeting yesterday, some small shareholders asked about the possibility of listing reforms after the exchange lost e-commerce giant Alibaba's initial public offering to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to look for another listing venue after it failed to convince the Securities and Futures Commission and the exchange in October to allow it to list with a share structure that would give its founders and the top management more control of the board despite holding minorities stakes. The US allows such dual-class share structures but Hong Kong does not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's listing committee is studying the issue while HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wrote in his blog about the need to take a fresh look at the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But institutional investors are opposed to any changes in existing rules. A survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association on Tuesday showed most are against any changes to the listing rules and want the one-share-one-vote principle to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before we make any changes to our rules, we would need to have a consultation to gauge the market view," Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates the third largest stock market in Asia, on Wednesday reported better-than-expected net profit of HK$7.4 billion (US$950 million) for 2017, up 28 per cent year on year, on the back of higher market turnover and record number of new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This beat the consensus forecast of a 27 per cent profit growth to HK$7.34 billion, according to a </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> poll of analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results also marked the second best year ever, behind the HK$7.96 billion earned in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earning per share stood at HK$6.03, up 27 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said it would pay a final dividend of HK$2.85 per share, bringing the full-year dividend to HK$5.4, up 27 per cent from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's shares fell 1.31 per cent to close the morning session at HK$286 before the results announcement during the lunch break.The bourse operator's shares have risen almost 49 per cent in the past 12 months, making it the 10th best performer on the Hang Seng Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fourth-quarter profit stood at HK$1.87 billion, up 51 per cent than a year, according to calculations by the Post, which also beat analysts' forecast of HK$1.85 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In Hong Kong, we witnessed a bullish securities market especially in the fourth quarter of 2017 when the average daily turnover reached HK$107.3 billion,” HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong said in the results statement. Chow will step down in April after serving in the post for six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher stock market turnover helped deliver a 38 per cent annual increase in trading fee income at HK$1.95 billion. The average daily turnover last year stoodat HK$88.2 billion, up 32 per cent from HK$66.9 billion in 2016, but still below the HK$105.6 billion in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April 2015, China allowed mutual funds to invest in Hong Kong stock market via the stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai, which has boosted turnover up to an average HK$200 billion per day. Turnover, however, went down after the mainland markets' slump in mid 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It rose again in 2017 as mainland investors increased their investment in Hong Kong equities after the launch of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The northbound and southbound trading through the two stock connect grew significantly last year, increasing by 194 per cent and 170 per cent respectively from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their investment now represents almost 10 per cent of the daily turnover, which helped to drive the Hang Seng Index up 36 per cent last year, making it the world's best performing benchmark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fees, a major source of income, rose 8 per cent last year to HK$828 million, as a record 174 companies launched IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, since there were no blockbuster floats, the total funds raised dropped 34 per cent to HK$128.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow, however, warned on risks ahead, as stock markets worldwide have seen intense volatility in the first two months of this year, adding that impending US interest rate increases and US tax reforms pose challenges to global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The world is also moving into a new era of new economy businesses and technology innovations, and the financial markets are facing a landscape filled with both opportunities and challenges,” Chow said, adding the exchange is in the midst of listing reforms to capture these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange last Friday announced that it would bring forward listing reforms from June to late April, and would start accepting listing applications from biotech companies without revenue or giant new-economy companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, which has led analysts from Citi and CICC to view the developments positively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will meet the media and analysts later on Wednesday afternoon to provide an update on the exchange's development plans.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FAST FACTS:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• GDP to grow 3 to 4 per cent this year</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• Fiscal reserves expected to reach HK$1.092 trillion</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$138 billion fiscal surplus; 40 per cent to be spent on relief measures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$50 billion in tax breaks; reductions on salaries and profits tax, rates</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$50 billion for innovation and technology development</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$2,000 one-off cash handout for poor students</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• No tax waiver on electric cars but drivers get subsidised one-for-one replacement scheme, capped at HK$250,000</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• One-off allowance to ‘N-nothings' makes comeback</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A budget with a clear eye on the future and massive expenditure to alleviate people's burdens - these were the twin pledges from Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po as he set out the Hong Kong government's spending blueprint with a record surplus of HK$138 billion (US$17.7 billion) as its centrepiece.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A chunk of the bounty, more than HK$50 billion, will be shared with at least 2 million Hongkongers - mostly through targeted tax reliefs, rate waivers and beefed-up allowances. And in an even-handed gesture, he pledged to invest the same amount on hi-tech development to transform the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current-term government is ready to think out of the box and act proactively to open up new horizons for Hong Kong,” Chan[http://www.scmp.com/topics/paul-chan] declared, as he delivered his first budget under the Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] administration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Riding on 3.8 per cent growth last year, Chan's forecast growth this year isas high as 4 per cent, with headline inflation kept at bay at 2.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The massive surplus - almost 8.5 times the amount projected in the last budget[http://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-budget-2017-2018] - also broke the 2007-08 record of HK$123.7 billion to become the biggest since the 1997 handover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This also increased fiscal reserves to an estimated HK$1.092 trillion by end-March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In delivering the budget, Chan, unlike his predecessor, took pains to show he was aligned with his boss' thinking, as he explained her “new fiscal philosophy” of optimising the surplus to invest in the future and relieve people's needs. “I agree entirely with her view,” he told the Legislative Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial secretary said he aimed to develop Hong Kong into a more diversified economy and highlighted innovation and technology as a major new growth driver that the city could not afford to lag behind in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The unstoppable wave of innovation and technology has swept through the world, fundamentally changing the global economic structure and the way we live and consume,” Chan said, as he presented an extra HK$50 billion in funding to boost IT development, on top of the HK$10 billion already reserved in last year's budget.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the new money, some HK$20 billion will be used on the development of the planned Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park in the border area of the Lok Ma Chau Loop. Some HK$10 billion will be injected into the Innovation and Technology Fund to support the establishment of research centres for health care technologies, artificial intelligence and robotics technologies, according to Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also proposed allocating HK$10 billion to Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks for it to boost research infrastructure and support for incubatees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In all these initiatives, Chan made clear the close link between the city's economy and that of the mainland. Noting that China now contributed more than 30 per cent to the global economy, he said the mainland's strategies have not only a global bearing but “are also the linchpin of Hong Kong's sustained prosperity”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To attract leading overseas and mainland internet enterprises and fintech companies to set up offices and research units in Hong Kong, Chan proposed HK$200 million in funding to Cyberport to enhance its support for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in a move to reform the stock exchange, he said that dual class share listings will be in place in the second quarter this year, potentially paving the way for listings by tech and biotech start-ups eager to be anchored in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To take advantage of the mainland's growing economy, Chan asked the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to set up an academy of finance to train the city's talent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the domestic front, while Chan did not heed the public's calls for handouts, the measures he rolled out came up to 40 per cent of the surplus. They include a salaries tax rebate of up to 75 per cent, with a cap of HK$30,000, widening the tax bands, a 20 per cent rise in tax allowances for families with children, as well as rates waivers of up to HK$2,500 a quarter, and extra social security payments to the needy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in line with his boss's fiscal philosophy, Chan departed from the past “small government” policy of keeping public spending at not more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product. Instead, he aimed to push the level to “slightly higher than 21 per cent” of GDP in the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 20 per cent cap was meant to avoid overexpansion of the government, but Chan argued: “Today, while acknowledging the forces and roles of the market, we have to be more proactive in managing public finances in the face of various development needs of society and the economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked later at a TV forum why he rejected calls for distributing cash to the people, Chan said he liked the relief measures to be aimed more specifically at the lower-income class.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan was made financial secretary early last year after his predecessor John Tsang Chun-wah[http://www.scmp.com/topics/john-tsang] quit the post to join the chief executive race, despite Beijing's apparent preference for Lam. Chan, who delivered his maiden budget last February, was picked by Lam to be finance chief in her administration, though it was widely reported he was not her first choice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The budget Chan delivered last year was mainly based on a nearly finalised draft prepared by Tsang. Wednesday's was widely seen as the first blueprint of his as well as Lam's philosophy on public financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his speech, a more confident-looking Chan, compared to last year, said his budget strategies also aimed to take care of the long-term needs of society and enhance health care and social welfare services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On health care, Chan noted the government had increased its recurrent expenditure by an average of 7 per cent over the past decade. Spending on public health care services will increase by 13.3 per cent to HK$71.2 billion in 2018-19, accounting for 17.5 per cent of total recurrent expenditure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An additional recurrent funding of nearly HK$6 billion will be allocated to the Hospital Authority in 2018-19 to increase the number of beds, operating theatre sessions and manpower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The limit on Elderly Health Care Vouchers will also be raised by HK$1,000 to HK$5,000 in 2018, which will involve expenditure of about HK$796 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also proposed to establish a HK$500 million fund to promote the development of Chinese medicine by providing support in areas such as applied research and knowledge exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To support the second 10-year hospital development plan, HK$300 billion would be set aside as an initial provision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The finance chief also set aside HK$20 billion for the improvement and development of cultural facilities, and another HK$500 million for the acquisition of museum collections and holding exhibitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On education, Chan also planned to increase recurrent expenditure by another HK$2 billion, on top of the HK$5 billion that Lam already pledged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the extra spending will be aimed at achieving quality education, through enhancing the professional development of teachers, strengthening support for kindergartens, and supporting schools in enhancing the promotion of life-wide learning, or education in real-life settings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan proposed to allocate some HK$504 million to launch a three-year pilot scheme to provide social work services in phases for about 150,000 children and their families in all aided childcare centres, kindergartens and kindergarten-cum-childcare centres.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also promised more resources from the 2018-19 school year to achieve “one social worker for each school”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There will also be a one-off grant of HK$2,000 to each student in need to support learning, involving an expenditure of about HK$740 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Largely following the footsteps of his predecessor, Chan offered a number of one-off “sweeteners” to ease the burdens of taxpayers and the needy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to higher tax allowances for children and dependent parents and grandparents, there will also be tax rebates of 75 per cent for salaries taxpayers, with the cap being lifted by 50 per cent from last year to HK$30,000. That is expected to benefit some 1.88 million taxpayers and see tax revenue reduced by HK$22.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For landlords, property rates will be waived for four quarters of 2018-19, subject to a ceiling of HK$2,500 per quarter for each property. That is estimated to benefit 3.25 million properties and reduce government revenue by HK$17.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And there will be two extra months' pay to recipients of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance or Disability Allowance. That will involve an additional expenditure of about HK$7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government will also set aside HK$15 billion for arrangements for offsetting severance payments or long service payments against Mandatory Provident Fund contributions - almost doubling the HK$7.9 billion proposed previously by Lam's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying[http://www.scmp.com/topics/leung-chun-ying-0]. Details of the new mechanism are expected to be released soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese Manufacturers' Association welcomed the budget measures but said the HK$15 billion the government set aside for the MPF offsetting mechanism was “still some distance away” from what the business sector had expected. It urged the government to increase its financial commitment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his speech, Chan noted that the property boom had resulted in land premiums increasing by HK$62.6 billion to HK$163.6 billion, or 62 per cent higher than estimated, but he did not touch much on cooling the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He only urged caution, saying the “key factors underpinning soaring property prices over the past few years are gradually undergoing fundamental changes”, citing the increased supply and possible US rate hikes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The private sector will, on average, produce about 20,800 residential units annually in the coming five years [from 2018 to 2022], an increase of 50 per cent over the annual average in the past five years,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides, as at end-December 2017, the projected supply from the first-hand private residential property market in the next three to four years will remain at a high level of about 97,000 units.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides, as the US interest rate normalisation process continues, the ultra-low interest rate environment of the past few years will no longer persist.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sharmaine Lau Yuen-yuen, chief economic analyst at mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services, expressed disappointment that Chan had not come up with measures to cool the market or help people own homes. She urged the government to ease the loan-to-value ratio to 90 per cent for flats priced up to HK$8 million to help first-time buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, possibly to help Lam honour her promise that there would be “surprises” in the budget, put forward some unexpected measures, including giving out 10,000 free tickets to primary and secondary students to Ocean Park, and HK$2 billion to expedite installation of lifts in schools, and HK$100 million for the promotion of e-sport.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung criticised Chan for failing to roll out any plans to address the income gap problem. “One-off relief measures cannot solve any deep-rooted social problems,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenny Shui Chi-wai, senior researcher at the policy think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation, welcomed the government's move to inject resources into innovation and technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Shui said the government should also increase funding for university research so as to “consolidate the world-class status of local universities and continue to train local talents”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company, also known as Ping An Good Doctor, has launched its highly anticipated Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) which aims to raise as much as HK$8.77 billion (US$1.12 billion) in what could become the city's biggest flotation by an internet-based business since ZhongAn Online's blockbuster IPO last September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing, which has already triggered an increase in Hong Kong's liquidity demand, is expected to ignite investor enthusiasm and become the catalyst for a strong potential pipeline of blockbuster new-economy IPOs this year, including star names such as Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed tech listing rule changes, set to be revealed on Tuesday, are also expected to facilitate a rash of dual-class share listings by tech and biotech companies that have yet to make profits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to use the [IPO] proceeds to expand our business, and fund future domestic and overseas acquisitions,” said Wang Tao, the medical service app's chairman and chief executive officer, on Sunday in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company plans to sell 160.094 million shares at an indicative price range of HK$50.8-$54.8 (US$6.48-6.99) per share, raising between HK$8.13 billion and HK$8.77 billion - which would be the city's most valuable this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If priced at the top, it could also become the largest flotation by an internet business since ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance raised HK$11.9 billion last September, in Hong Kong's biggest fintech listing ever.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/23/b779b118-462a-11e8-ab09-36e8e67fb996_image_hires_114409.jpg] Retail investors will be offered 6.5 per cent, or 10.4 million shares, with the rest targeted at international institutional investors, who have shown an “enthusiastic” response, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmond Hui, chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Bright Smart Securities, also expects the stock to receive a hot response from the public, given its “new economy” nature.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will reignite investor enthusiasm for IPOs, as the market anticipates more [new economy listings] to come,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail proportion will be offered from Monday to Thursday, with shares expected to start trading on the main exchange on May 4.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Hong Kong brokerages have already allowed retail investors to pre-register bids for the new stock using margin loans, including Bright Smart Securities, </span><span class="s3">Haitong International</span><span class="s1">, Phillip Securities, Prudential Brokerage, and Celestial Asia Securities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company posted a 2017 loss of 1 billion yuan (US$158.86 million), its third annual loss, but Lee Yuansiong, deputy chief executive officer for </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, said that is normal for a tech “unicorn” in its early phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Unicorns usually have four phases - building scenarios, obtaining traffic, generating revenue, and generating profit,” Lee said. “Good Doctor is still in the obtaining users and traffic phase.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group and Good Doctor will cooperate closely on businesses in future and that he was optimistic on the latter's outlook.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the prospectus, around 40 per cent of the net proceeds will be used for business expansion, such as its e-commerce business, hiring sales and medical professionals, acquiring new users and funding marketing activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just under a third will be allocated to funding potential investments or acquisitions at home and abroad, a fifth will go on research and development, while the rest will be for working capital and general corporate purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, the offshore arm of China's biggest brokerage, is planning to accelerate its expansion in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other areas that are part of the Beijing's ambitious “Belt and Road Initiative”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong-based brokerage, founded in 1986 and acquired by state-owned </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> five years ago, has re-entered Pakistan through a partnership with Alfalah Securities. It also intends to establish a presence in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Dubai this year through similar partnerships with local firms in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past 32 years, CLSA has established a presence in 13 markets in Asia, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Korea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As China expands, we are also expanding globally,” said Jonathan Slone, CEO of CLSA, in an interview in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asia is our backyard. [But] we want to be in all areas of the ‘Belt and Road Initiative'.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China launched its flagship global trade strategy five years ago, aiming to create an economic land belt that includes countries on the ancient Silk Road through central and west Asia, the Middle East and Europe, as well as a maritime route that links China's port facilities with the African coast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is estimated that Beijing has pumped several hundred billions of US dollars into building infrastructure projects across more than 70 countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, Chinese companies, mostly state-owned, have secured US$500 billion of construction contracts along the belt and road's route in the past five years. Funding for the projects mostly comes from state lenders or financial groups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone said because of the firm's relationship with </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">, which is controlled by China's </span><span class="s3">Citic Group</span><span class="s1">, CLSA has advantages in facilitating cross-border funding and carrying out capital market work for Chinese companies to expand overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being owned by a strong parent has put us in a unique position, into and out of China,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone hopes to leverage the parent's deep connections in China and CLSA's own extensive Asia network and global distribution, to play a more central role in helping Chinese companies go global and bringing international capital to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said CLSA's investment banking business has grown sharply, with the help of </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">. The firm has completed 17 initial public offerings so far this year and has an “enviable pipeline”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to the connections of its parent in China, CLSA has won work on a number of high-profile Chinese tech and internet IPOs in the Hong Kong market. It recently advised Xiaomi, the first company with a dual-class share structure to list in Hong Kong, and Beigene, the first Nasdaq-listed firm to seek a dual listing under Hong Kong's new rules to attract biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone also expects the firm's private equity business to expand, as he sees increasing demand from technology companies to raise capital from the private market. The firm currently has US$4 billion of assets under management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA kicks off its 25th investor forum on Monday in Hong Kong, an annual gathering of international investors, companies, and industry leaders to discuss political and economic conditions as well as future trends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone said for the first time, nearly half of the companies attending the forum this year are Chinese firms, which may be coming to tap public and private capital or new markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission is looking at ways to improve the conduct of banks' securities departments, with a report due to be issued in the next two to three weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Ashley Alder said the report was not part of the SFC's regulatory or supervisory functions but the result of working with large banks that operated securities business to find ways to improve their operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is aimed at finding the best practices and ways forward," Alder told more than 100 brokers and fund managers at a lunch yesterday. "It is aimed at achieving a better dialogue with industry so as to find ways to improve."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks are regulated by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> but those that also operate securities businesses need to follow the SFC's code of conduct to ensure sufficient risk-management and investor-protection measures are in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder also said the SFC was open minded about indications from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> that it intended to consult the market about dual-class share structures to meet the needs of some companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It would be entirely up to the exchange to have a public discussion about the issue," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such share structures have been the subject of heated debate since October, when the SFC refused to provide a waiver to mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, which sought to use a structure that would have allowed its 28 partners - mainly founders and senior executives - to name a majority of directors. The SFC said it would violate the one-share, one-vote principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder said the SFC would soon issue a consultation paper on the regulation of electronic trading systems known as dark pools and might also issue another on relaxing the requirements imposed on real estate investment trusts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will also look next year into regulations governing the way asset management companies pay their distributors. Britain has banned some commission payments to distributors while other markets require higher levels of transparency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder also welcomed an announcement last week that the HKEx and </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> had signed an agreement to co-operate on the introduction of yuan products and to work together on regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said some US and European regulation now would extend to Asia and it would be good to have the two exchanges form an alliance that could speak on behalf of Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> may postpone its potential HK$100 billion listing plan to 2015 if the mainland's top e-commerce firm cannot get a deal done in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A delay would be linked to the terms of a deal struck last year with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, giving Alibaba the right to buy back half the 24 per cent stake the United States internet company holds in the mainland firm by the end of 2015, investment bankers told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Failure to list before December 31, 2015, would force Alibaba back to the negotiating table to agree new terms, bankers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun and his long-time friend and executive vice-chairman, Joe Tsai, have persuaded the company's top management that an initial public offering should not be rushed, despite a determined push in recent weeks to set the listing wheels in motion, sources familiar with the discussions told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's not about money. In fact, Alibaba isn't short of cash. Jack Ma cares more about retaining control of the company than how much money he can raise from the IPO," a banker with knowledge of the situation said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsai, who is considered Ma's closest adviser, told several bankers recently that a listing this year was not a must for Alibaba and that the company had other priorities including making overseas acquisitions, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and might have only a matter of weeks left before the same happened in Hong Kong, the Post reported on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Delaying to next year could put a big dent into the potential HK$100 billion analysts estimate Alibaba could raise if the deal comes to market this year, given the pent-up demand among fund managers after a lack of major new offerings this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba joins the swelling pipeline of deals for early next year, it risks coming to market as an expected increase in global interest rates fuelled by an anticipated scaling back of the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme jolts stock market valuations, money managers say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for Alibaba yesterday reiterated that the company had no specific timetable for an initial public offering, had not appointed underwriters, and had not selected a listing venue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has run into regulatory trouble in Hong Kong over Ma's determination to keep management control of the firm he founded in Hangzhou in 1999, despite having only a 7.4 per cent stake. The top management team combined own about 10 per cent of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beside's </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">'s 24 per cent holding, Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> has a 36.7 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Talks with Hong Kong regulators have been stalled by a stand-off over the firm's desire to retain a partnership structure that the authorities fear could give too much voting power to company executives at the expense of ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival Nasdaq are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed and in particular popular among technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first nine months of this year, there were a total of 98 listings on the two boards to raise US$9.14 billion, down 52.2 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board saw 50 deals worth US$8.65 billion to take a 7.2 per cent global share, ranking it third among the world's top stock exchanges by the amount of proceeds raised. It had topped the global rankings for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> took the top spot with US$20.4 billion from 48 deals, giving it a 16.9 per cent global share.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With only three months to go until the end of the year and no news of any big players planning to list in Hong Kong, the exchange is unlikely to return to the top," said Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It has lost out to other markets such as New York as we have not done enough to attract new-economy companies to list here. We should change our listing regime quickly."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> completed a consultation to set up a new board to allow listings by companies with a dual-class share structure and start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Charles Li ­Xiaojia said the consensus pointed towards carrying out reform to capture new-economy firms but a second consultation had been planned later this year before the new board could be launched.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial sector account­ed for the biggest share of listing proceeds raised in the city in the first nine months of this year, at 60 per cent, followed by health-care firms with 10 per cent and the consumer sector with 9.4 per cent. Hi-tech firms accounted for just 5.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest listing in Hong Kong so far this year was the US$2.2 billion deal by </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> in March, followed by mainland online insurance broker Zhong An Online P&amp;C ­Insurance, which just raised US$1.5 billion last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's global ranking for technology listings was a lowly 13, way behind New York, Shenzhen and Singapore.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two of the world's top business consulting groups, McKinsey's and EY, have urged </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) to be ultra-careful and selective in choosing which firms will be allowed to list on its proposed New Board, or what some are calling “The Third Board”, stock market which will target new-economy, start-up companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Board will be operated separately from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">McKinsey's managing partner of Greater China Joe Ngai said HKEX should only let in start-ups that have solid business models and high prospects of profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a good idea for HKEX to propose the launch of a new market for start-up companies as many will not be able to match the requirement of the main board or the GEM to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But early-stage start-ups should not be allowed to list. If they only have a concept or an idea and no solid business performance or income, they would present too risky a prospect for investors,” he said, speaking at last week's </span><span class="s3">World Economic Forum</span><span class="s1"> in Dalian last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the exchange simply allowed these start-ups to list, it may end up with a market full of poor quality companies, and that would be a repeat of what mistakes were make when the GEM was created.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999, positioning itself then as the Hong Kong version of the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in the US for hi-tech companies to list. But it has been widely considered as a flop in attracting quality tech firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In May 2017, average daily turnover for the GEM was still only HK$742 million (US$95 million), under 1 per cent of the main board's daily average for the same months and even lower than when it was launched with great fanfare in November 1999</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX launched a consultation paper a fortnight ago proposing the Third Board. It is planned to be split into two separate smaller markets: a premium one open to all investors for companies that can match the main board's high requirement, but which have a dual-class share structure which is banned on the main exchange, and another one for start-ups, in which only professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ngai believes the Third Board would attract more technology firms to list if retail investors were to trade on it too.The much better option for early-stage start-ups is venture capital or incubator funding. It would be better to let start-ups grow to a certain size and strength before allowing them to list on the proposed new marketJack Chan Hoi, managing partner of financial services for EY in Greater China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong retail investors are smart. Many of them are veterans who can make their own investment choices,” Ngai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adding his backing, too, for only carefully selected entry to the New Board, Jack Chan Hoi, EY's managing partner of financial services of Greater China area, said HKEX must be fearful of allowing start-ups to list too early.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX needs to be selective in the choice - they have to be solid businesses,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The much better option for early-stage start-ups is venture capital or incubator funding. It would be better to let start-ups grow to a certain size and strength before allowing them to list on the proposed new market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The quality and prospects of any company on the board must be impressive,” Chan said, adding he is aware of many mainland start-ups who might like to use the proposed new board to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is a liquid market used by many international investors. HKEX's proposed new board should attract both mainland start-ups and large technology firms to list in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong attracted the largest number of initial public offerings ever for any single third quarter as the new listing rules implemented in April attracted some big tech flotations, while globally the number for equity market deals plunged 21 per cent to a three-year low, according to data from Dealogic on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forty-seven IPOs launched on the Hong Kong market in the July to September period, raising a combined US$16.4 billion, overshadowing the US$14.9 billion raised on US exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest listings during the period included telecoms tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion offering and food delivery service app </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s US$4.2 billion fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with Xiaomi's US$5.4 billion IPO in June, they comprised three of the top five global offerings so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the third quarter, the Hong Kong stock exchange also saw 126 IPO filings, taking the overall number in the first nine months of 2018 to 340, up 48 per cent for the whole of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The surge was helped by the new listing rules that allow companies with dual-class share structure and pre-profit biotech firms to launch IPOs, Dealogic said in its latest equity capital market (ECM) report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The post-IPO performance, however, has been “mediocre”, reflecting a sharp turnaround in investor sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/10/03/c5729c5a-c63e-11e8-9907-be608544c5a1_image_hires_105012.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPOs larger than US$100 million fell by an average 16 per cent from their offer price in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 30 per cent of the IPOs recorded a retail subscription rate of 15 times or more in the third quarter. That ratio is sharply lower than the second quarter when 77 per cent of the IPOs were oversubscribed 15 times or more. The drop in the ratio indicates a sharp reduction in investor enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165955/china-tech-ipo-boom-continue-least-another-year-says-china]Backed by the IPO activity, Hong Kong's ECM volume also climbed to US$20.6 billion, the highest third-quarter figure in eight years. ECM activities usually include IPOs, private placements, and transactions on the secondary market to help companies raise equity capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Hong Kong's hot ECM market was in contrast to the global landscape. Global ECM volume fell 21 per cent year on year to US$158.4 billion from 1,230 deals, the lowest third-quarter level since 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology led all sectors globally, contributing 21.9 per cent of the total quarterly deal volume for ECM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> topped the global ECM bookrunner ranking in the third quarter, with a 9.26 per cent share, followed by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">' 9.25 per cent and </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">'s 8.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, cross-border Chinese IPO activities were also strong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125873/hong-kong-falling-behind-ny-ipo-rankings-are-investors-ready]Twelve Chinese firms raised US$3.5 billion from the US market in the July to September period, which would have been a record third-quarter if Alibaba's US$25 billion IPO in 2014 is excluded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the same period, Chinese IPOs also made up the lion's share for overall cross-border IPO volume in the US, which reached US$5.7 billion. In the second quarter, the overall cross-border IPO volume was only US$1.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two largest IPOs in the US during the third quarter were both from China - online discounter Pinduoduo's US$1.5 billion listing and electric car maker Nio's US$1 billion offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, PwC Hong Kong predicted in a report on Tuesday that Hong Kong will reclaim the global IPO crown this year with an projected fundraising amount of HK$300 billion (US$38.2 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, the city lost the top IPO spot to New York after two straight years in the position and slipped behind Shanghai for the first time, according to data from Dealogic.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private equity investors have told a key industry event that while competition between the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges for attracting technology-related listing candidates has intensified this year, they prefer to exit their investments through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said better liquidity, less restrictions on controlling shareholder sell downs after lock-up periods, and generally higher transparency on the Hong Kong stock exchange have combined to give more comfort to private equity investors in choosing the city to exit their investment via an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The leading investors were gathered for the “SuperReturn China” conference in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wanlin Liu, a managing director at the </span><span class="s3">Carlyle Group</span><span class="s1">, said while she saw a tendency two years ago for private-equity-backed Chinese start-ups to list on the onshore A-share market - shares trade on the two Chinese stock exchanges - more recently, she has seen more companies preferring to list on offshore markets, particularly Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While the A-share market had traditionally won out (as a market for private equity exits from their Chinese portfolio companies) due to the higher multiples that A-share companies tended to trade at after their listing, recently offshore markets, especially Hong Kong, have become attractive due to their transparency and more ready access to liquidity,” Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lock-up periods are predetermined amounts of time following an IPO when large shareholders such as company executives and investors representing considerable ownership, are restricted from selling their shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Controlling shareholders are subject to lock-up requirements under both Hong Kong and China listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter's case, the regulator and the exchanges have rules to also control the pace at which, and the amount of, how such divestment is allowed and completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A venture capital shareholder, for example, will be able to sell down any existing shares on the stock market equivalent to less than 1 per cent of the total issued outstanding shares of the newly-listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such divestment should also be done in a window of 1-3 month intervals each, depending on how long the venture capital fund has invested in the start-up before its IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules have no specific percentage cap that dictates shareholder divestment after any lock-up expiry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gilbert Zeng, managing director and head of China for </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> private equity, said he expects more Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong, after the exchange introduced its new dual-class share listing regime in April, which the market has welcomed, particularly for technology start-up IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition “due to the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connects [share trading links] in place with Hong Kong, many of these companies are going to [choose to] list in Hong Kong, instead of the US for example,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock Connect is the mechanism through which international investors can directly trade securities listed on the two mainland bourses via the Hong Kong stock exchange. Currently there are over 3,500 A shares available via Stock Connect.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But ultimately, the decision about whether to choose the Hong Kong or mainland bourses for a listing is also driven by the commercial considerations of the companies planning the move, Liu said, despite offshore markets being more of an historical preference by their private equity backers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of our portfolio companies had still insisted on listing as an A share, as [the management] wanted a lot of individual retail investors likely to buy their stocks, to know their brand,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It could be an advertising or marketing event for the company if their customers know that the company's A share price is going up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, exit values rose by a quarter in 2017 compared with the previous five-year average, to a near-record US$115 billion, with 710 exits completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around 7 per cent of that value was done through IPO, according to a Bain &amp; Company Asia private equity report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For mainland companies, some industry players said their preferred exit route for private equity investors remained through IPOs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An escalating US-China trade dispute could be bad news for the initial public share offering ambitions of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges as companies would be less willing to consider a listing if the markets became volatile, according to accounting and consultancy firm Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It added that US tax reform plans and interest rate increases by the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> could spur a movement of capital away from Asia, another risk factor for markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The escalating trade war between the US and China will cause continuous market volatility, which will seriously impact big firms' willingness to publicly sell their shares,” said Edward Au, co-leader of the national public offering group at Deloitte China, at a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The IPO window is especially important for big companies. They may consider delaying their plans if the capital market is volatile. This is a potential big threat to the IPO market [for the rest of the year].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter of this year, Hong Kong saw 64 IPOs raising a total of HK$24.4 billion (US$3.1 billion), up 64 per cent and 84 per cent respectively from the same period a year earlier, Deloitte said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges in the same period, 37 IPOs raised a total of 40.7 billion yuan (US$6.5 billion), down 72 per cent and 42 per cent respectively year on year, as regulators tightened scrutiny to ensure the quality of listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange's US$3.4 billion raised in the first quarter ranked it fourth behind the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, Germany's Frankfurt market and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">. Hong Kong was ranked fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Deloitte said new listing rules to come into effect in both Hong Kong and mainland China are likely to help their appeal to companies considering a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong and China are both likely to implement IPO rule changes in the second half, which should provide a comprehensive set of listing choices for Chinese companies, including foreign-listed Chinese companies and tech unicorns currently considering IPOs,” said Au.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The two markets' new IPO rules will complement each and increase the region's appeal as a whole.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Deloitte maintained its earlier estimate that Hong Kong will see 150 to 160 IPOs in 2018, with a total fundraising amount of between HK$160 billion and HK$190 billion, up 24 per cent to 48 per cent from 2017. The city is likely to retain its spot as one of the world's top three IPO markets this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China exchanges meanwhile could attract 180 to 240 IPOs in 2018, with 170 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan to be raised. The total estimated IPO value reflects a drop of between 13 per cent and 26 per cent from 2017, as Chinese regulators are expected to continue tightening of their scrutiny to ensure the quality of listed companies, Au added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He anticipated more medium-sized firms in the internet technology, biotech, consumer and education sectors would list in Hong Kong in the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Shanghai and Hong Kong were the second and third top global IPO markets behind New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expanded listing reforms in progress, says HKEX chairman[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139938/expanded-listing-reforms-progress-says-hkex-chairman]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing rules include allowing companies with dual-class share structures to list and accepting the listings of biotech firms which have not yet turned a profit, as well as making it easier for innovative Chinese companies to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, meanwhile, has unveiled a plan to lure foreign-listed technology firms, with a proposed trial programme of Chinese depositary receipts for companies with a current market value overseas of more than 200 billion yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it is working with local and mainland authorities to fight to get Saudi Arabia's national oil giant, Aramco, to list in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest initial public offering in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For a giant company like </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the stock exchange alone would not be able to fight for its listing in Hong Kong. We are working with the Hong Kong and central governments and all related authorities to try our best to fight for its listing here,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, which operates the local bourse.Its listing here would be good for China, enabling it to play a more important role in the international resources marketCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are working very hard on it and we welcome </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to choose to list here in whatever format it prefers. Its listing here would be good for China, enabling it to play a more important role in the international resources market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing reporters after the bourse's annual general meeting on Wednesday, Li said if Hong Kong was in a position to launch the “IPO connect” scheme at the same time as the Aramco listing, it would provide an additional incentive for the oil leviathan to list here. HKEX is working with Hong Kong and mainland regulators on a link which would allow international investors to subscribe to newly listed A-shares, while mainlanders could subscribe to IPOs in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The existing stock connects between HKEX and the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen only allow investors to do cross border trading in companies already listed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be the perfect match to launch the IPO connect and the </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> IPO at the same time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco has already appointed </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> as one of its advisers for the flotation which is expected to raise up to US$100 billion, the biggest sum ever raised through a shares listing. That estimate is based on expectations that Aramco will offer 5 per cent of its equity, valuing the company at about US$2 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The state owned oil company is still considering possible venues for its debut, with New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo the main contenders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that since the Middle East and mainland China have a good political relationship, Hong Kong stood a good chance of winning. But brokers point out London and New York have traditionally been the destinations of choice for oil companies to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> two weeks ago issued a statement declaring it would ease listing conditions for companies linked to “One Belt, One Road” initiatives to help develop Hong Kong's stock market. A source at the SFC told the Post that this more flexible approach would apply to Aramco if it decided to float its shares in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is keen to expand its IPO market after it lost out to New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen to rank as the fourth largest IPO market worldwide in the first quarter. A lack of new mega listings meant the city lost its coveted No 1 spot which it had held in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the exchange would soon launch a consultation paper about introducing a third board for new listings of technology firms including those wanting to float with a dual-class share structure - something currently banned from the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He refused to comment about the 25 per cent cut to his bonus last year, the result of lower turnover denting the stock exchange's profits.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's snub of Hong Kong in favour of New York for its record initial public offering continues to divide market authorities. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) says it will go ahead soon with the second stage of its consultation on changing its listing rules to allow IPOs with dual-class share structures, such as Alibaba's. But market watchdog the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), has reaffirmed its strong opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba bypassed Hong Kong after HKEx rejected its bid for exemption from the one-share, one-vote rule so its founder and top executives could control its board membership. This newspaper supported the decision not to bend the rules in this case but welcomes a review to see if they are in line with the times. One question is whether even limited departure from the one-share, one-vote principle would be good for the international image of the Hong Kong market in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investor concerns remain, including conflicts of interest. For example, HKEx is a listed company on its own boards whose directors may face a conflict in reconciling efforts to boost the city's standing as a financial centre with the best interests of investors. And unlike New York, Hong Kong investors cannot resort to class-action lawsuits if they want to take action against an unscrupulous or incompetent controlling shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response to concerns, the second-stage consultation emphasises higher governance standards for dual-share-class listings. The SFC wants to know how many standards could be monitored on an ongoing basis and what public shareholders or regulators could do about it if they were not upheld. These are reasonable questions, since the proposal could blur the alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders. At the end of the day it comes down to the quality and accountability of management. The one-share, one-vote principle is not to be abandoned lightly. But it is bound to come under increasing pressure, especially from hi-tech entrepreneurs and innovators who tend to favour two-tier share structures to retain management control.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Financial Services Development Council in Hong Kong has pledged its support for the local bourse to launch a third board to draw technology firms and other overseas companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council, a government-appointed advisory body, in 2014 recommended Hong Kong follow Britain in setting up multiple markets to introduce different boards with different listing rules that are tailor-made for the needs of diverse investors and firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the council first made these recommendations, there wasn't much reaction from the markets and other regulators. Now it has become a hot topic recently as the stock exchange will soon have a consultation on the launch of the third board,” chairman Laura Cha Shih May-lung said at the council's annual media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing rules in Hong Kong have not changed much in the past 20 years. We would support such a review as keeping an open mind is important in attracting different companies to list in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week that a consultation paper would be issued by the end of this month on the launch of the third board and the review of the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rules on the third board are expected to be more flexible than those on the main board and the GEM in order to attract listings by technology firms, start-ups, overseas companies and those with dual-shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> prefer dual-class share structure as their founders hold only minority stakes but want to retain control. But unlike the US, which has drawn many technology firms to list there, Hong Kong does not allow this kind of structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said the council had in the past three years issued 30 reports ranging from proposals to improve listings, green financing and fund management in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many of these reports were the result of the studies by scores of financial professionals. The regulators have followed up on these recommendations but that was usually done in a slow pace. We would like to see quicker follow-ups in future,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides the third board, she believes the green financing proposals would be equally important for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green financing refers to financial investments and products like bonds that are issued to fund sustainable development projects and initiatives such as pollution reduction and the promotion of the use of renewable energy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many projects of the ‘Belt and Road Initiative' are related to green financing. Hong Kong needs to do more to promote green financing. Otherwise, we would lose out to other markets in the competition for the role as the fundraising hub for the belt and road projects,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched by Beijing in 2013, the global trade initiative aims to build more roads, railways and other infrastructure projects in the more than 60 countries along the route to boost trade and economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks ended Monday morning's trading session at a five-day high, as investors were buoyed by rising hopes of peace on the Korean peninsula and incoming hot-ticket IPOs from Chinese biotechnology firms, following the Hong Kong stock exchange's relaxation of listing rules last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 1.5 per cent, or 458.09 points, to 30,738.76 by lunchtime, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.06 per cent, or 247.98 points, to 12,314.56. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.6 per cent to 2,508.02. Markets in China and Japan are closed for a public holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a rebound for sure. Lots of IPOs are coming into the Hong Kong stock exchange and more Korean peninsula peace talks are on the horizon, pulling stocks up such as Tencent,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Banks have also rebounded as investor sentiment changed. The Hang Seng Index is still under 31,000, which is quite a resistance, but we want to see how much turnover there is at the end of the day.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market was helped by a strong showing from financial and technology stocks, which bounced back from last week's declines. Insurance giants AIA and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced 2 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively, after Ping An's spin-off health care app Ping An Good Doctor raised a staggering US$1.1 billion from its hotly anticipated IPO on Friday.Lots of IPOs are coming into the Hong Kong stock exchange and more Korean peninsula peace talks are on the horizon, pulling stocks up such as TencentLouise Tse, </span><span class="s3">VC Brokerage</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Chinese firms rushing to jump onto the Hong Kong IPO bandwagon include the world's fifth-largest smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi, which hopes to raise at least US$10 billion, according to Bloomberg, and Shanghai Henlius Biotech that is planning to raise at least US$500 million, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange announced last week that it will allow dual-class share listings to better compete with rival New York exchanges in attracting big-label technology and biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of mainland Chinese lenders </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> and Bank of China Hong Kong jumped 2.8 per cent to HK$6.97 and 4.7 per cent to HK$40.90 respectively. </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> also hit a three-year high of HK$200.40, gaining 2.45 per cent by </span><span class="s3">noon.Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, whose shares had the biggest turnover, also gained 0.9 per cent to HK$392.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Chinese automobile manufacturer BYD suffered a 5.8 per cent drop to HK$54.70 after reporting on Friday a 83 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The major Wall Street indices closed almost flat on Friday after a rough week for technology stocks. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.11 per cent to 2,669.91 points after a slew of US corporate earnings announced last week exceeded market expectations, with strong showings for technology giants </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Intel</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Microsoft</span><span class="s1">. The Nasdaq Composite inched 0.02 per cent higher to 7,119.80. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.05 per cent to 24,311.19.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US economic growth cooled during the first quarter due to weak consumer spending, according to a report released on Friday by the </span><span class="s3">US Commerce Department</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher on Monday, ending April on positive note, but analysts were cautious about the market outlook in May, as rising US rates could spark faster-than-expected capital outflows and US-China trade uncertainty could hurt tech stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index advanced 1.7 per cent, or 527.78 points to close at 30,808.45. For April, the index rose 2.4 per cent, snapping a two-month losing streak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, known as the H-share index, rose 2.2 per cent, or 264.81 points, to 12,331.39. It logged a monthly gain of 2.8 per cent in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board's daily turnover decreased 4 per cent to HK$93.6 billion from the previous trading session. The Hong Kong market will be closed on Tuesday for Labour Day and reopen on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland markets were shut on Monday and will also resume trading on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Rising US treasury yields and the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions will continue to keep the market under pressure,” said Ben Kwong, executive director for KGI Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher US treasury yields will trigger capital outflows from Hong Kong and push up interest rates, which will hurt equities, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tony Ho, director of research for China Goldjoy Securities, suggested caution on trading next month, as the trade dispute between the US and China spreads to the tech sector, which could strengthen the odds of “sell in May and go away” and sink tech shares, which drove Hong Kong markets last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Ho said MSCI's scheduled inclusion of A shares in June could spark capital inflows to the Chinese stocks before hand and potentially reignite the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, financial and tech shares both shone. </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced 1 per cent to HK$77.55, after its spin-off health care service app Ping An Good Doctor priced its closely-watched IPO at the top end, raising US$1.1 billion in Hong Kong's biggest offering so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> jumped 3 per cent to HK$8.32, and Bank of China climbed 2.4 per cent to HK$4.30, after China extended the grace period before it imposes new strict regulations on the country's US$15 trillion asset management industry to the end of 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> gained 0.7 per cent to HK$391.00, and </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">improved by 3.7 per cent to HK$130.10.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong generally lags behind in global trends. Economically, socially and legally, we're living in the past. By how much is difficult to gauge, but, by some measures, it could be as much as a decade. If we don't start catching up, we're going to suffer big time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The loss of the US$25 billion Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] stock listing to New York was a prime and costly example of how stuck in our ways we can be. Almost three years later, the strictly enforced "one share, one vote" rule that blocked the bid remains in place, even though exchanges elsewhere have realised the importance of the dual-class share structure to ensuring the growth of firms, particularly those in the tech sector. Beyond big business, consider how the refusal to adopt European standards on air quality is affecting health and reputation, how the well-being of workers and their families is undermined by a lack of standard working hours and what a substandard pension scheme means for livelihoods. And we're not even talking about issues like gay marriage and marijuana that are being legalised elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But let's move onto online shopping, an area that smartphone-loving Hongkongers should have embraced. Getting up-to-date statistics is difficult, but a Consumer Council study[https://www.consumer.org.hk/ws_en/competition_issues/reports/2016/online-retail.html#_ftn1] from last year comparing figures for 2014 gives a good perspective. That year, 23 per cent of internet-using Hongkongers had shopped online in the previous 12 months, compared to 67 per cent of mainland Chinese, 69 per cent of Japanese, 73 per cent of Germans, 78 per cent of Americans and 81 per cent of Britons.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's compact size and shop-packed streets may be behind the low take-up. But I've a feeling much of it is to do with not trusting online sellers. Hong Kong people love to window shop and see what they're buying before they purchase. But that gets in the way of the experience that online provides of trying new products from the wider range available, often at a lower price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My sons long ago realised that, feeding their gym-rat lifestyles with supplements, equipment and clothing.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong generally lags behind in global trends. Economically, socially and legally, we're living in the past. By how much is difficult to gauge, but, by some measures, it could be as much as a decade. If we don't start catching up, we're going to suffer big time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The loss of the US$25 billion Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] stock listing to New York was a prime and costly example of how stuck in our ways we can be. Almost three years later, the strictly enforced “one share, one vote” rule that blocked the bid remains in place, even though exchanges elsewhere have realised the importance of the dual-class share structure to ensuring the growth of firms, particularly those in the tech sector. Beyond big business, consider how the refusal to adopt European standards on air quality is affecting health and reputation, how the well-being of workers and their families is undermined by a lack of standard working hours and what a substandard pension scheme means for livelihoods. And we're not even talking about issues like gay marriage and marijuana that are being legalised elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But let's move onto online shopping, an area that smartphone-loving Hongkongers should have embraced. Getting up-to-date statistics is difficult, but a Consumer Council study[https://www.consumer.org.hk/ws_en/competition_issues/reports/2016/online-retail.html#_ftn1] from last year comparing figures for 2014 gives a good perspective. That year, 23 per cent of internet-using Hongkongers had shopped online in the previous 12 months, compared to 67 per cent of mainland Chinese, 69 per cent of Japanese, 73 per cent of Germans, 78 per cent of Americans and 81 per cent of Britons.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's compact size and shop-packed streets may be behind the low take-up. But I've a feeling much of it is to do with not trusting online sellers. Hong Kong people love to window shop and see what they're buying before they purchase. But that gets in the way of the experience that online provides of trying new products from the wider range available, often at a lower price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My sons long ago realised that, feeding their gym-rat lifestyles with supplements, equipment and clothing. So, too, have consumers elsewhere in the world, with increasingly dramatic effect on cityscapes. Online trade has become so engrained that shops are closing. The trend is especially noticeable in the US, where thousands of retail stores operated by big-name brands like </span><span class="s3">Macy's</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Sears</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Kmart</span><span class="s1">, to name but a few, have already closed this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The same is happening in Europe, Canada and Australia; it's inevitable when stores don't respond quickly enough to customer demands on price, selection and fashion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is mulling reforms to grab a share of the US$40 billion of potential stock offerings from Chinese technology firms seeking to relist from the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx will on Friday announce the result of a consultation on a dual-share structure reform. Chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Thursday: "We are going to have some news on this reform soon." He did not elaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also confirmed a South China Morning Post report that the HKEx board had approved two reforms - a braking mechanism to check stock volatility and an auction system for closing share prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the details would be announced next month and both measures would come into force in the second half of next year to give the market time to prepare.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules do not allow dual-share structures - which give the promoters of a company greater say despite being minority stake holders - that many technology firms seek. After trying to list in Hong Kong, e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted last year to list in the US, where dual-share structures are permitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been a lot of debate over the Alibaba listing, resulting in the consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are a number of Chinese technology companies listed in the US that are now considering coming back to list in the domestic markets. This is because the A-share market is getting bigger and has high liquidity," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This delisting trend in the US would provide huge opportunities for mainland [Chinese] and Hong Kong markets. It provides both opportunities and challenges to the HKEx. We would need to make sure Hong Kong is attractive enough for these companies to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of the end of May last year, a third of the 102 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures, with 70 per cent of them being IT firms. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of the firms that listed between January 2010 and December 2013 were IT firms, according to the HKEx.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts estimate the market capitalisation of US-listed Chinesecompanies could amount to US$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August last year, the HKEx launched a consultation on whether it should allow dual-share structures and received a mixed response. While supporters believe a change in rules is necessary to attract listings, others worry it would affect the standard of investor protection in the local market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far this year, seven overseas-listed Chinese firms, including </span><span class="s3">Qihoo 360 Technology</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Sungy Mobile</span><span class="s1"> and WX Pharma, have gone private and are expected to relist in the mainland market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council and regulatory bodies have publicly voiced support for fast-track domestic listing of US-listed enterprises. Qianhai, in Shenzhen, has already expressed its interest in building an "offshore exchange" to allow overseas companies to list or dually list in the new economic zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas Chinese internet stocks are trading at a much lower price-earnings multiple than their counterparts at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While overseas online games companies are trading at 19 times earnings, the ratio for their domesticrivals is 108, according to a </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> report. Similarly, the ratio for overseas e-commerce goods providers is 55, against 320 in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the operator of the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong, is likely to report a 27 per cent jump in profit for 2017 on Wednesday on the back of higher stock market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The exchange is widely expected to have strong profit growth in 2017 as the market turnover is so strong,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for financial services and a broker. “The </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has also started to generate higher revenue and the number of new listings is also getting higher, which should boost the profitability of the HKEX up by about 30 per cent from last year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily turnover in 2017 stood at HK$88.2 billion, up 32 per cent from HK$66.9 billion in 2016. The exchange earns its income from trading fee paid by investors on each stock transaction, which means a higher turnover results in higher income.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee was another major income source for the exchange in 2017 as a record 174 companies launched initial public offerings. However, since there were no blockbuster IPOs the total funds raised dropped 34 per cent to HK$128.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange last Friday announced that it would bring forward the listing reform from June to late April when it will start accepting IPO applications from biotech companies without revenue or giant new economy companies with dual class share structure to list in Hong Kong. The reform will also allow large companies now listed in the US and the UK to apply for secondary listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Citi Research report, led by analyst Darwin Lam, said it expected such companies to start applying for listings in Hong Kong from May, which would boost the outlook of HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bourse operator unveils multifunctional HKEX Connect Hall at site of trading hall[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2133901/hang-seng-index-makes-red-debut-first-year-dog-trading-day]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We reiterate our view that the listing regime changes are a milestone for the Hong Kong stock market, which should help strengthen HKEX's listing hub status,” Lam said in the report after the exchange's announcement on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has a“buy” rating on the HKEX and a target price at HK$330. The stock closed at HK$285.8 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank CICC was even more bullish giving the HKEX stock a target price of HK$400 as it believes stronger-than-expected market turnover was likely to continue this year and next.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Average daily turnover in January reached HK160 billion, up 181 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the driving forces for the rising turnover was the southbound flow from Chinese investors via the two stock connect between mainland exchanges and Hong Kong, which represented almost 10 per cent of daily turnover on some days last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent weeks, the hottest topics on the minds of Hong Kong and mainland residents have been the opening of two major infrastructure projects, Hong Kong's high-speed rail connection[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2163423/sacrifices-hong-kong-made-high-speed-rail-mainland] to the mainland and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2171825/hong-kong-asks-guangdong-authorities-investigate].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the nation marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2170136/chinas-reform-and-opening-can-keep-delivering-miracles-says-xi], these connections are official steps to form a "one-hour living circle[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1817579/success-rail-link-hong-kong-china-mainland-depends-joint?page=all]” between Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau, and will usher in greater movement of people, goods and services between the cities. As the nation continues to reform and open up, Hong Kong could play a more proactive, flexible role in integration with the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back on the past 40 years, Hong Kong and mainland China have developed in complementary ways, and both sides are indispensable. Since the early days of reform and opening up, when Hong Kong and Macau accounted for 80 per cent of foreign investment in China, Hong Kong has always served as a bridge between the mainland and the international community. China took 40 years to modernise, a process that would have taken many other countries more than a century, and Hong Kong has been there every step of the way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said: "We are a contributor as well as a beneficiary in China's reform and opening up[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2170636/hong-kong-eager-play-bigger-role-chinas-further-reform-and].” In the process of reform, Hong Kong has always built on its strengths to support the country's needs. For example, Hong Kong has stepped up efforts to drive innovation and technology[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2154652/carrie-lam-promises-more-support-new-economy-and-tech-after-hong-kong-learns] in recent years, setting aside some HK$50 billion from its budget to support development in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, fintech and other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against this backdrop, the Hong Kong stock exchange reformed its listing regime[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142536/hong-kong-exchange-accept-listing-applications-under-new-rules] to allow firms from innovative sectors and companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong. It resulted in the Hong Kong listings of Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2154346/xiaomi-shares-fall-hong-kong-trading-debut-us-china-trade-war], Meituan[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2164966/meituan-dianping-shoots-past-42-top-hong-kong-firms-market-value] and other mainland tech firms. The listings not only bring more investment, but will also promote Hong Kong's understanding of mainland internet companies and inspire young people to join the tech sector. This is a prime example of the synergy that can be created between Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our closest neighbouring city, Shenzhen, is the best testament to China's reform and opening up. In 40 years, Shenzhen has made great advances in economic development, and arrived at principles known as the "Top 10 Concepts of Shenzhen”. The most widely known are "Time is money, efficiency is life” and "Innovation encouraged and failure tolerated”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, these concepts can be brought into play in many aspects of the country's development, especially with regard to flexibility in policy implementation. For example, many Hongkongers find it a hassle to seek employment on the mainland given the restrictions, and this has been the concern of many members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In response, the state has issued a series of policies to improve the employment environment[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2159989/new-id-card-will-give-hong-kong-macau-and-taiwan-residents] confronting residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the mainland. Residents of the three areas can now join the mainland's housing fund scheme, be exempt from work permits, and enjoy tax breaks in Hengqin[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2162170/hongkongers-working-mainland-china-face-being-taxed-their], a special economic zone in Zhuhai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, as everyone knows, Hong Kong and Shenzhen are in different stages of development, and both cities have different strengths in terms of urban management and industrial development, which is why there is still plenty of room to learn from and be inspired by each other. Today, Shenzhen and Hangzhou[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2152935/hangzhou-chinas-answer-silicon-valley-hit-returning-graduates] are full of vitality, thanks to rapid development in hi-tech industries and flexible policies. Hong Kong's present achievements are built on its rapid development in the past, and have benefited many people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I truly believe that in the deepening of the country's reform and opening up, Hong Kong can be more integral to the development of the country, so that Hong Kong's youth can continue to access a wealth of opportunities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, said it did not support a draft proposal to allow companies to issue weighted voting rights (WVR), a week after markets operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it would launch a second round of consultation on the contentious topic later this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SFC is of the view that Hong Kong's securities markets and reputation would be harmed if WVR structures became commonplace,” the SFC said in a statement on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On his website, shareholder activist David Webb said: “This should kill it, as all changes to 8listing rules must be approved by the SFC.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC decision puts it at loggerheads with the HKEx over an issue many in the business community supported, hoping it would lead to greater deal flow and fee income. The debate was revived last year after Alibaba jilted Hong Kong in favour of New York, where dual-class share-holding structures enshrining minority control are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder raised concerns about the integrity of Hong Kong's securities markets if the listing rules were amended.This should kill it, as all changes to 8listing rules must be approved by the SFCDavid Webb,shareholder activist</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Would fund managers apply a ‘governance discount' to stock prices, or adjust portfolio weightings away from Hong Kong?” he said. “Will the WVR proposal be the magic bullet that would cause listing hopefuls to choose Hong Kong over a foreign stock exchange?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC said the draft proposal did not explain how many proposed safeguards and conditions could be monitored on an ongoing basis and what actions could be taken by regulators or public shareholders if they were not complied with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of large international fund managers, including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> and BlackRock, have warned that dual-share structures could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week: “The second-stage consultation on weighted voting rights structures should consider the balance of investor protection and maintaining our competitiveness, as answering with a simple yes or no would be premature.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange said yesterday the SFC's view would “be material” to the proposal put forward for second-stage consultation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's three-year run of growth in the city's listings market will switch into reverse gear next year, reports say, as deal sizes get smaller.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Professional services firms EY and KPMG forecast that Hong Kong's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market will raise HK$200 billion from up to 120 companies next year, against about HK$225 billion in 109 deals this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The projected smaller scale of the initial public offerings reflects that most of the mainland's state-owned enterprises have listed over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reports may give ammunition to those market participants wanting to see an end to the city's ban on controversial dual-class share structures. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is conducting a consultation on whether to amend its listing rules to accommodate structures that give shareholders the same financial benefits but with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation was prompted by mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's move to bypass Hong Kong for New York, where exchange officials agreed to allow its senior managers to have greater voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the global IPO rankings for 2014, Hong Kong ranked second after the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which hosted Alibaba's record-breaking US$25 billion sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO market has never returned to the heights seen in 2010, when it raised a record HK$449 billion from 101 listings in 2010, thanks to </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$22 billion dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital in Asia will return to the US markets once the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> starts to raise interest rates, Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY, said in a briefing on the report yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi believes that Beijing is considering loosening its grip on the full circulation of H-shares, which should translate into higher trading volumes as the overhang of non-tradeable shares is removed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [full-circulation of H-shares] scheme, if fully implemented, should attract more institutional investors to invest in mainland companies listed in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> is reviewing the full circulation of locked-up Hong Kong shares, with relevant documents to be released next year, EY said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's approval for such a move means that restricted shares issued by a mainland company can be traded in full outside the mainland and denominated in foreign currencies, such as the Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2005, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> was given special permission from Beijing to list with this arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at KPMG, said financial firms would be the major IPO driver next year, reflecting their need to meet tougher capital requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial industry professionals are still divided over how they can remake the city's stock exchange to make it the world's most attractive place for startups and technology firms to raise capital, even as the first round of a public consultation process drew to a close on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited</span><span class="s1">, the operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation and overseer of the consultation, has proposed the establishment of a third board to provide a listing avenue for companies with dual share structures, as well as those with no profit track record. Accountants, bankers, brokers and lawyers are divided over whether a third board is needed, in addition to the existing main board and the growth enterprises market (GEM) for startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/18/da1bea5a-83ee-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_163241.JPG]"We received a lot of comments already, and we expect to receive more," said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited, the bourse operator overseeing the process. "If the market supports, we will have another round of consultation of detail regulations. If all would gain support, I would hope to see the new board to start in the first half of next year," said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, at the exchange result briefing last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake is how Hong Kong can make its bourse attractive enough as a fund-raising destination in competition with New York, Shanghai or Singapore and other global markets, especially for startups and so-called new economy companies in financial technology, e-commerce and biotechnology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies raised US$5.8 billion in Hong Kong through initial public offerings during the first six months of this year, a decline of 19.5 per cent compared with the same period in 2016, when the city was top of the league table for new listings worldwide, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The companies that raised funds in the city were dominated by the financial industry, accounting for 59 per cent of funds raised during the period, while technology companies raised the equivalent of 0.8 per cent, the data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/18/20bd598a-83ef-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_163241.JPG]The loss of appeal to technology was the factor that unseated Hong Kong from the top of last year's league to third place. New York took the crown in the first half, with companies including Snap Inc raising a combined US$18.2 billion. Shanghai was the second largest, with US$9.6 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further illustrating Hong Kong's lack of appeal to new-economy companies, the Shanghai Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange, or Lufax, obtained a license to operate its financial technology business in Singapore, instead of Hong Kong, a stone's throw from the base of its parent Ping An Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed third board will comprise two parts. One is a so-called premium market open to all investors, hosting companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but with a dual-class share structure currently disallowed on the main bourse. The second is the so-called pro market focused on startups where only professional investors with higher appetite -- and understanding -- of risks are allowed to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposals are taking the wrong direction entirely to improve Hong Kong's markets," said David Webb, founder of the activist shareholders' platform Webb-site and former HKEX director. Hong Kong doesn't need a new board, and he favours "a single board, under a single statutory regulator, combining listing and takeover regulation, and not the four-board mess that HKEX advocates," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stockbroker community support the new board, provided it has enough protections for shareholders, said Benny Mau, chairman of the city's Securities Association, an industry guild.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the industry watchdog agency, said it's open minded, either way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC keeps an open mind to listen to what the market says about the new board," the agency's chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said in response to inquiry by the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US [had] dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them [were] IT companies. In Hong Kong only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business, August 30</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some people just don't know when they are well off. In my view, one of the strongest arguments for banning distorted voting rights in listed companies is that it helps keep those wretched IT companies off our market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, I know that some of them have been spectacular winners. But for every Apple Corp there are a hundred sinkhole stocks in information technology. Let the venture capitalists have them, I say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the ordinary investor and for the reputation of the stock market nothing beats boring companies that do boring things. They make you money. IT loses you money. Don't believe me? Welcome to poverty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And let's get it straight about Alibaba, too. The Hong Kong exchange was actually willing to listen to the plea that its founders be given preferential voting rights but insisted they would have to feel at least some of the pain of their smaller shareholders if things went wrong. You've got to put some skin in the game, said the listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba wouldn't have it. The game the founders wanted to play was "heads I win, tails you lose". The committee quite rightly showed them the door, upholding the principle that all questions of democracy have long been settled in Hong Kong - A shares have the same voting rights as B shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But now we have our exchange officials dismayed that Alibaba made good on its threat and is listing in New York instead. Maybe we should allow high-powered B shares after all, they say in a consultation paper, wringing their hands all the while - "The Exchange has formed no view for or against Weighted Voting Rights".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Uh-huh. I see. Is that also true of your boss, fellows?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the key question here is one that this paper only touches on briefly. It is that investor protection in New York goes well beyond regulators who may, and then again may not, have more than the greater glory of their exalted selves in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What investors have in New York is two very good tools for wringing compensation from market brigands who have robbed them. These two are class-action lawsuits and contingency fees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you believe you have been cheated, you can join your lawsuit to those of others who are taking the same case to court, and you can make arrangements with the lawyers handling the case that they will only be paid if they win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's in New York, where people live in the 21st century. Our own lawyers in Hong Kong still live in the 18th century and will have none of it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Class-action lawsuits are not allowed and lawyers who accept contingency-fee payments can be sent to prison for it. It's called champerty, a horror in the eyes of our judges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus all we have in Hong Kong if things go wrong is the Securities and Futures Commission, which cannot always get your money back for you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two essential legal reforms that could possibly make preferential voting rights worth considering here have been rejected outright.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have even been made a crime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Abandon all hope ye who think things may change. They won't. Our lawyers are dead against it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They see a threat to their income and, as we have an overweighting of lawyers in the </span><span class="s3">Legislative Council</span><span class="s1">, the sky will fall in before champerty is recognised as a legal virtue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In these circumstances I can't for the life of me understand why the exchange bothers putting out a paper soliciting views on preferential voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To introduce such a thing in the absence of class-action lawsuits and contingency fees is to put a noose over the head of the small investor and the rope in the hands of any bandit who happens by.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just forget it, fellows. If you can't change the lawyers' rules, then don't change your own.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has paved the way for a listing in the United States, with a spokesman for the mainland e-commerce giant saying yesterday that both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq had accepted its special partnership structure, which would let its top executives nominate the majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two bourses had formally accepted Alibaba's partnership structure, which derailed its initial public offering (IPO) plan in Hong Kong, the spokesman said, adding: "We just want other people to understand the partnership structure is an open, innovative, responsible and sustainable system for a company's fundamental needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Alibaba spokesman said last night that the company had not yet selected an exchange or appointed underwriters for a US listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong regulators had said there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's a pity that Hong Kong lost out on this iconic internet giant being listed in the city, but the Hong Kong stock exchange, as a regulator as well, had to safeguard the interests of minority shareholders," said Linus Yip Sheung-chi, strategist at First Shanghai Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rebuff by the Securities and Futures Commission and the exchange resulted in a war of words between the two camps.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai said last month that Hong Kong had to consider what was needed in order to adapt to future trends or risk becoming content to look on as the rest of the world passed it by.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-Keung told a Legislative Council meeting this month that the exchange had no plans to consult the market about any changes in its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US is one of the few markets that allow a dual-class share structure, which means different shareholders have different rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba could have fetched up to HK$100 billion in a listing, </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1"> said in June. That would have made it Asia's biggest IPO since October 2010, when insurer AIA raised HK$159 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future, the California-based electric car start-up founded by Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting, said on Monday that its largest shareholder </span><span class="s3">Evergrande Health Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> had deliberately withheld promised payments and prevented it from seeking alternative financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The development comes after Evergrande accused FF of trying to scrap the original stake sale deal after spending the initial investment of US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande Health, a unit of the Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group, announced in June that it would buy a 45 per cent stake in FF for a total investment of US$2 billion, as part of the group's diversification plan into the hi-tech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the deal, Evergrande fully acquired Season Smart, which owns 45 per cent of the joint venture that controls FF - Smart King. Through Season Smart, Evergrande has already made an initial investment of US$800 million in FF. It also agreed to pay another US$1.2 billion in two equal instalments in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Evergrande said the EV start-up had started assembling its first high-end car, FF91, at its US production base. FF also set up an operating headquarters in China for research and development and production in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, in an exchange filing on Sunday night, Evergrande said FF demanded another US$700 million in July after spending the initial investment of US$800 million, following which it signed another agreement with the start-up to pay this US$700 million under certain “payment conditions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While “the payment conditions had not been fulfilled”, Jia “manipulated” his majority board seat position to begin an arbitration against Evergrande at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre on October 3, 2018, the filing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jia was seeking to deprive Season Smart of its shareholder right to approve any future financing plan, while also trying to terminate all the other agreements with Evergrande, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said that it has already fulfilled its obligations under the relevant agreements and that the arbitration has “severely damaged” their rights and interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Season Smart has engaged a team of international lawyers and will take all necessary actions to protect Season Smart's continuing rights under the relevant agreements, and to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF responded on Monday afternoon denying the accusations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Contrary to what has been reported, Evergrande failed to make any of the promised additional payments beyond the original US$800 million, despite FF and its CEO complying with their obligations and meeting all required conditions for funding under the July 2018 agreement,” FF said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Instead, Evergrande held the payments back to try to gain control and ownership over FF China and all of FF's intellectual property. At the same time, Evergrande is preventing FF from accepting any immediate financing from other sources.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF denied either Jia or anyone else had “manipulated” the board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up said Evergrande had a full understanding of why and when FF needed the additional US$700 million, which is to achieve production and delivery of FF91 in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the only reason ‘FF is trying to get out of the deal with Evergrande' is because Evergrande has failed to live up to its end of the bargain and make the payments it agreed to make … Evergrande shouldn't be permitted to withhold the funding and simultaneously prevent FF from accepting alternative financing or investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF added it will continue to take actions, including pursuing other funding opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in Evergrande Health briefly skidded 37 per cent at Monday's open, before paring losses to 16.4 per cent, to close at HK$8.78. Evergrande Group also lost 6.3 per cent to end at HK$20.95.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Evergrande Health has gained 90 per cent from the level before the June announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future is considered key to Evergrande Group's electric car ambition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hui Kayan, chairman of Evergrande Group, said in April the group plans to invest 100 billion yuan (US$14.5 billion) in the next 10 years in a wide range of hi-tech sectors like life sciences, AI, robotics, and alternative energy. Electric cars are an important part of the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said in August that Faraday Future aims to reach an annual production capacity of 5 million vehicles by 2028. The Chinese unit of Faraday Future has already been set up in Guangzhou city, with a registered capital of US$2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, Evergrande Group invested 14.5 billion yuan for a 41 per cent stake in Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment Group, one of China's largest car dealers. The investment has been regarded as an effort by Evergrande to pave the way for Faraday Future's car sales network in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Evergrande Health became the largest shareholder of the joint venture, it has less voting right than Jia because of the dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on the June agreement, each share Evergrande Health owns equals one vote compared to 10 votes for each share held by Jia. Consequently, Evergrande Health only has 12 per cent of the voting right. Jia, who owns 33 per cent of the company, controls the rest of the voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the agreement has a special clause, which stipulates that if the management is unable to perform its duties, Jia's voting rights will be reversed to Season Smart. It would result in a full control of Faraday Future by Evergrande Health.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future was founded in 2014 by Jia, chairman and CEO of the debt-saddled technology conglomerate LeEco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Jia defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to China and said he needed to stay in the US to focus on Faraday Future. He said his brother and wife had been empowered to handle matters relevant to the company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have a brand new market next year for “new economy” companies, allowing companies ranging from start-ups and technology firms with dual share structure to list, according to a consultation paper by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> released on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal, announced in the paper to collect views over the next two months, recommends that the new board will not accept any traditional or old economy firms, but only those classified as technology or new economy firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This will be the first market in the world that restricts the types of companies allowed for listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has a main board which currently requires companies to make a combined profit of HK$50 million (US$6.42 million) in the three years prior to the listing. The second board Growth Enterprise Market does not require a profit track record but companies have to have HK$20 million in annual cash flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither the main board nor the GEM has attracted many technology firms to list. Of the HK$19.4 billion raised by initial public offerings in the city last year, 69 per cent was accounted for by financial firms, with just three per cent from technology companies, far lagging behind the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Shenzhen's ChiNext.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Out of Hong Kong's total market capitalisation, financial or property companies account for 44 per cent, while new economy firms only make up a mere three per cent. This pales in comparison with the 59 per cent on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and 44 per cent on the </span><span class="s3">NYSE</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our IPO market is now dominated by traditional companies, while we have few new economy companies listing. The proposed new board is aimed at attracting new economy companies from the mainland or other international markets to list here,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX in a briefing on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope these new economy companies now already listed in the US or other markets would consider a secondary listing on the new board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Disallowing firms with dual share structure to list in Hong Kong is part of the reason companies have shunned the city for the US. With a proposed third board, Hong Kong may be able to compete for the US$49 billion raised in the US in the past 10 years, which represented 17 per cent of all IPO funds raised in Hong Kong during the same period.The proposed new board is aimed at attracting new economy companies from the mainland or other international markets to list hereCharles Li, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Singapore and London are considering allowing dual class share firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's proposed new board will have two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target technology or new economy companies that meet the main board listing requirements, but have a dual share structure. US-listed companies with dual share structure would also be allowed to apply for a secondary listing on the premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> adopt such shareholder structures as their founders hold minority stakes but want to retain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But firms will face trading suspension if they failed to properly disclose financial information or if the exchange consider them unsuitable to be listed. They will be delisted on the premium market if they were suspended from trading for six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Retail investors could also trade in the premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other market in the new board is designed for start-up companies. Neither profit nor turnover records would be required and the regulation would also be a light touch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There would be a delisting requirement where after a certain period of time, if these companies fail to meet certain operation requirements or if their share prices drop to certain threshold, they would be delisted. Firms that have been suspended from trading for 90 days will be delisted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is an easy in, easy out concept for the start-ups to raise funds easily, but they would also be easily delisted unless they work hard to prove that they have a business case,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since the risks of these start-ups would be high, the start-up market would be restricted to professional investors to trade only,' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said the new board would be popular with start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, there would be challenges of defining what companies are qualified as new economy, for them to apply to list on this new board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation paper also made recommendations to the GEM and the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The role of the GEM will be redefined as a market tailored for small- and medium-sized companies that do not meet the main board listing requirements and are not technology or new economy companies. All listing candidates should launch initial public offerings instead of private shares placements that are currently allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, GEM would be removed as a stepping stone to the main board, as the minimum market capitalisation for firms will be lifted from HK$100 million to HK$150 million, with annual cash flow requirement to be increased from HK$20 million to HK$30 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the main board, changes proposed include raising the minimum market capitalisation of firms from HK$200 million to HK$500 million and the minimum public float from HK$50 million to HK$125 million, as well as extending the lock-up period from one to two years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks rose the most in three years on Monday, boosted by gains in Chinese financials amid expectations Beijing would slow down its deleveraging campaign if trade tensions with the United States affect the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 2.5 per cent, or 67.88 points, to 2,815.11, while the CSI 300 Index, which tracks large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose by 2.8 per cent, or 94.06 points, to 3,459.18. The increases recorded by both indexes were their biggest since May 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose by 1.3 per cent, or 372.88 points, to 28,688.50, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed by 1.4 per cent, or 145.73 points, to 10,768.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock market rebound came from a very sharp previous drop, and the US not hitting back at China with even bigger tariffs over the weekend,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “The key resistance level for the [Hang Seng] benchmark index will be in a range of between 29,000 and 29,500.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, signs pointed to the US taking a softer stance towards China, with Washington taking a break from further escalating its trade war with Beijing after both countries fired their first salvoes last week, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">office of the US Trade Representative</span><span class="s1"> announced an exclusion process for Chinese products subject to Section 301 tariffs, seeking to lessen the blow for US companies. And judging by China's retaliatory tariffs on a range of US agricultural goods so far, the mainland seemed to be avoiding an escalation in trade tensions too, said analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced by 1.8 per cent to HK$70.95, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2 per cent to HK$6.94 and the </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> gained by 1.5 per cent to HK$5.61.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And while smartphone maker Xiaomi, the first company with a dual-class share structure to list in Hong Kong, closed 1.2 per cent below its listing price, at HK$16.80, on its trading debut, technology related companies fared well. Internet giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2.4 per cent to HK$396, </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">rose by 2.2 per cent to HK$145.1 and </span><span class="s3">AAC Technologies Holdings</span><span class="s1"> was 1.1 per cent higher at HK$107.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts widely expect the US to impose tariffs on US$50 billion worth of imports from China; and in a bearish scenario, there is a risk the duties could expand to hit a further US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods.The key resistance level for the benchmark index will be in a range of between 29,000 and 29,500Linus Yip, First Shanghai Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As international trade conflicts flare and cause significant stress to the Chinese and global economy, domestic policy easing is likely to step up and offset the pain, according to Helen Qiao, China and Asia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A set of Chinese growth data to be released this week is expected to be a critical test for the local markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, the Shenzhen Composite Index rose by 2.5 per cent, or 38.56 points, to 1,574.54, while the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">-style ChiNext rose by 2.5 per cent, or 38.56 points, to 1,574.54.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Asian markets also rose on Monday. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained by 1.1 per cent, or 264.04 points, to 22,052.18. South Korea's Kospi was up by 0.6 per cent and Australia's All Ordinaries Index edged up 0.2 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While initial public offerings by technology unicorns - start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion - such as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1"> have attracted hoards of retail investors looking for a quick profit, venture capitalists such as Rebecca Lin Rui have kept a cool head.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This despite the prospect of upcoming IPOs offering her company, Eight Roads Ventures, an opportunity to exit its investments at a handsome profit.Eight Roads is a proprietary investment unit of fund management company </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1"> that has backed internet companies such as Asiainfo and </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> , which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following a listing reform introduced last week, Hong Kong now allows flotations by companies whose founders and key managers want to retain control through dual-class share structures, as well as biotechnology companies that do not have any revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The best ways of climbing aboard the biotech investment bandwagon [http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2141590/best-ways-climbing-aboard-biotech-investment-bandwagon]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This has paved the way for many companies, which would not have otherwise listed in Hong Kong, to appear on the radars of local investors, who are mostly unfamiliar with biotechnology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Globally, the investment enthusiasm for Chinese biotech firms is unprecedentedly high,” Lin, who leads Eight Roads' China health care venture investments, told the Post in an interview. “For us, I'll ask if there is really good science and good entrepreneurs to build world-class companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The enthusiasm for biotechnology was supported by a sweeping industry reform in China aimed at making it internationally competitive. The industry regulator, China Food and Drugs Administration, has published dozens of policy circulars in the past 18 months to simplify and speed up the clinical trials of new drugs and their commercialisation approvals, as well as to incentivise new and generic drugs development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this all should also be backed by sound fundamentals, said Lin, who is a partner at Eight Roads.“There is too much attention on quick exits and IPOs,” she said. “We are not too concerned about the hype … we only focus on early stage start-ups and our focus is on value creation together with the companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms [http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A major reason why Eight Roads has been able to take a long-term approach with its investments is the fact that all of the money it invests belongs to its parent, </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1"> , freeing it from external investors' pressure to take profit and distribute returns regularly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eight Roads first invested in China's health care sector as early as 1995, when it bought into Pharmanex, a manufacturer of “nutraceuticals” - foods with medicinal benefits, such as vitamins and minerals.Since then, it has ploughed more than US$480 million into 33 companies in China's health care sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eight Roads probably has the biggest exposure to China's health care sector as a single investor,” Lin said, declining to reveal the current market value of its portfolio and its strategy for exiting investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China had very few dedicated health care institutional investors before 2005, and health care-only funds only emerged about three years ago, which included a US$250 million fund set up by Eight Roads last September.The company plans to invest about 40 per cent of the sum in innovative drug development, 40 per cent in health care services and information technology, with the remainder for medical technology such as diagnostic devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why Hong Kong is in a sweet spot to harness Chinese biotech listings [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2129628/why-hong-kong-sweet-spot-harness-chinese-biotech-listings]We are not too concerned about the hype … we only focus on early stage start-ups and our focus is on value creation together with the companiesRebecca Lin Rui, partner, Eight Roads Ventures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eight Roads' investees span the entire supply chain of the health care sector, from drug developers such as listing hopefuls </span><span class="s3">Innovent Biologics</span><span class="s1"> and diabetes-focused </span><span class="s3">Hua Medicine</span><span class="s1"> , through to medical devices makers and oncological clinical data platform operator Medbanks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company even funded the construction of Delta Health, a hospital in Shanghai specialising in cardiovascular surgeries and care.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This diversification has allowed Eight Roads to help its investees form strategic business partnerships.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Focusing on its role of founding investor in most of its investees, Lin said Eight Roads' investment journey has been “quite challenging but rewarding”, as it has helped them attract talent, find investors and strike strategic cooperation deals with partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin did not disclose the returns track record of Eight Roads, only saying it was “far higher than industry returns”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For a venture capital and private equity investment made in 2015 in the health care sector globally excluding the US, the average return was 25 per cent by the end of September last year, according to data collated by </span><span class="s3">Cambridge Associates</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here is a law of investment which is not declared but rather left to you to discover on your own when you explore investment - There is never such a thing as a shortage of money. There is only ever a shortage of good ideas in which to invest that money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I can't prove it with science or statistics and yet I assure you from an almost 20-year career as an investment analyst that it is true. There is always money looking for worthwhile opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, I know that people tell you it's not so, that they have had wonderful ideas but they just could not raise the money to bring those ideas into reality. You don't pick a fight by telling such people that perhaps their ideas were not quite so good but I'm sure the thought occurred to you. Stick with that thought.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What many ideas people also propose is that they bring their ideas to their deals while the backers put up the money and, when (if) the ideas have proved successful, the ideas people will get the money and the backers will get to feel good about it.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may change its listing rules and introduce a dual-class share structure after the exchange operator said it plans to consult the market on the launch of a third board in an effort to attract more listings by technology and new economy firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, January 20</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here is a law of investment which is not declared but rather left to you to discover on your own when you explore investment - There is never such a thing as a shortage of money. There is only ever a shortage of good ideas in which to invest that money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I can't prove it with science or statistics and yet I assure you from an almost 20-year career as an investment analyst that it is true. There is always money looking for worthwhile opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, I know that people tell you it's not so, that they have had wonderful ideas but they just could not raise the money to bring those ideas into reality. You don't pick a fight by telling such people that perhaps their ideas were not quite so good but I'm sure the thought occurred to you. Stick with that thought.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/01/22/2f7da2b0-e00a-11e6-8fcb-68eb4ed74971_image_hires.jpg]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What many ideas people also propose is that they bring their ideas to their deals while the backers put up the money and, when (if) the ideas have proved successful, the ideas people will get the money and the backers will get to feel good about it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Get real, say I. In the first place, ideas are communally derived.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the local bourse operator, is expected to post 11 per cent net profit growth for the first half of 2017 as a result of better market turnover and higher volume of derivative trading, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is expected to report on Wednesday that its second quarter net profit grew 3 per cent to HK$1.6 billion, or HK$1.34 per share, according to consensus of analysts polled by Bloomberg. They expected revenue for the quarter would be up 7 per cent to HK$3.09 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Add the already announced first quarter net profit of HK$1.72 billion and the bourse operator's first half profit is expected to reach HK$3.32 billion, up 11 per cent from HK$2.99 billion in the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First half revenue is expected to grow 10.98 per cent to HK$6.248 billion, up from HK$5.6 billion in the first half of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the first half of 2017 the average daily turnover was HK$76 billion which is up 12.6 per cent year on year from the first half of 2016. The higher market turnover brought in better fee income which contributes to the profit for HKEX," said Kenny Wen, a wealth management strategist at </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The volume of derivative products trading also reach a record high level in the first half of this year which also brought in higher fee income," Wen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time for Hong Kong to define the ‘new economy' amid talk of third board at stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2105149/time-hong-kong-define-new-economy-amid-talk-third-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX earns fee income from investors on stock and derivatives products trading as well as from listing fees paid by listed companies. It also earn fee income from commodities trading from its wholly owned subsidiary </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which is the world's largest metal exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds raised through initial public offerings in the first half totalled HK$53.6 billion, an increase of 23 per cent when compared with HK$43.6 billion for the same period last year. In terms of numbers, there were 72 newly listed companies in the first half, up 80 per cent when compared with 40 for the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific, said the higher number of new listings and the stock connect programmes have brought in higher revenue to the exchange.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since the launch of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect from December and the removal of the total quota for the stock connect scheme, we have seen more fund flows from mainlanders buying Hong Kong stocks in the first half. Mainlanders now account for about 10 per cent of all turnover of the Hong Kong stock market which boosts fee income for the exchange," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsui said the launch of bond connect on July 3 and the two new gold futures contracts on July 10 would bring in more revenue to the exchange in the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter the exchange already reported a better than expected 20 per cent growth in its net profit to HK$1.72 billion, which was boosted by a one-off HK$55 million interest payment from the liquidation of </span><span class="s3">Lehman Brothers</span><span class="s1">. Excluding that, it still reported profit growth of 16 per cent to HK$1.67 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will host a briefing on Wednesday to discuss the results. The market will also be keen to learn more about the progress of the new third board planned for next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange is seeking consultations until August 18 on a proposal to introduce a new board to attract more technology companies to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board would consist of two markets. The first is a premium market open to all investors, hosting companies that meet the eligibility requirements for a main board listing but which have a dual-class share structure currently banned on the main exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second market will be focused on start-ups and would be limited solely to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange is also keen on convincing </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list in Hong Kong, expected to be the largest initial public offering worldwide, raising US$100 billion. Markets expect the Saudi Arabia oil company to sell 5 per cent of the firm, valuing the business at US$2 trillion. New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo are in the race to capture the listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah Mobile, the fast-growing security software business of Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft, plans to raise about US$300 million in its initial public offering in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Cheetah, formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software, intends to list its shares on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, according to its filing on Wednesday with the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said the net proceeds from the share offering would mainly be used to strengthen its research and development, sales and marketing, and international expansion efforts. It did not provide the number of shares to be sold or the price range of the offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Established in 2009, Cheetah provides free-to-download applications that include mobile security software Clean Master and mobile power booster Battery Doctor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CCB International said in a report last month that those popular apps offered plenty of commercial opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah posted a net profit of 62 million yuan (HK$78 million) on revenue of 750 million yuan last year. Under its business model, the firm mainly generates revenue from its more than 380 online marketing partners, the biggest of which are Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a separate filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday, Kingsoft estimated that its 54.09 per cent shareholding in Cheetah will be diluted to about 47 per cent after the spin-off is completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah has proposed adopting a dual-class share capital structure that would allow Kingsoft to retain control and continue to consolidate the unit's financial results after the IPO. This type of share structure is not available in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a company with less than US$1 billion in revenue in its last financial year, Cheetah also qualifies as an "emerging growth company" under US law, meaning it can take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laurence Li Lu-jen, who takes over as chairman of Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council, said on Tuesday listing reforms and other measures introduced by the government recently had enhanced the city's competitiveness as a financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li was speaking in the immediate aftermath of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's flotation in Hong Kong, which only raised US$4.72 billion instead of the expected US$10 billion. It also meant the city was unable to reclaim its crown[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2153456/ipo-crown-eludes-hong-kong-xiaomi-does-not-live-its-blockbuster] as the world's top IPO market - it ranked third globally in the first half of 2018, the same as last year.We cannot control how the market reacts to reformsLaurence Li Lu-jen, incoming chairman, Financial Services Development Council</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The council does not focus on the ranking of IPO markets. We support the listing reform introduced by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, and believe it is working in the right direction, promoting innovation and technology development in the city,” Li, a barrister, told a press conference. “We cannot control how the market reacts to reforms,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li was appointed by the government on Friday and will assume the post of chairman[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2153461/veteran-insider-set-head-hong-kongs-finance-industry] on Wednesday, taking over from Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who in April became the first woman to chair bourse operator HKEX. He will be in office until January 16, after which he will continue as the chairman of the council, which will be incorporated as a company, for another two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining the council in 2013, Li has been pushing for reforms such as those introduced this year by the HKEX, allowing companies with dual-class share structures and biotechnology firms with no revenue to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he would continue to promote financial technology and investor protection in his new role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the tough tasks ahead is turning the FSDC into an incorporated company early next year, which will allow it to have more resources and hire professionals for research and promotion,” said Li.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council currently relies on government secondment or voluntarily staff for research and promotion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, who was present for the press conference, said she had known Li for more than 20 years, since their time together at </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> in the early 1990s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the past five-and-half years, the council has completed 35 reports on how to promote Hong Kong as a financial centre. I believe Li will continue to lead the council, to work further to promote Hong Kong,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is expected to trade close to the 7.85 weak-side convertibility undertaking through 2019 because of rising volatility in the currency amid a string of initial public offerings and strength in the US dollar, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar traded at 7.8487 per US dollar late afternoon on Monday after previously falling to a low of 7.8499, approaching the threshold for the monetary authority to intervene in the currency markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under its currency board system, the de facto central bank is obliged to buy or sell the Hong Kong dollar to keep it within a range between 7.75 to 7.85 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange points may be more influenced by short term events than before, such as IPOs,” Ronald Man, fixed income and currency emerging Asia strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> said in a recent research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure Xiaomi locked up about HK$23 billion (US$2.9 billion) in subscriptions in June. China Tower, the world's largest operator of transmission towers for mobile phone networks, is also planning to raise as much as HK$68.1 billion in an IPO, the biggest such sale globally in nearly four years. Retail investors can subscribe to the offer from Wednesday until next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But any banking liquidity squeeze is likely to ease once the IPOs are completed. That would widen back the US-Hong Kong interest rate gap, attracting currency traders to sell the Hong Kong dollar for the higher yielding US dollar and exerting pressure on the local currency, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One-month Hibor was at 1.8 per cent on Monday, down 33 basis points from a 10-year high of 2.13 per cent hit on June 25, when it briefly closed its gap with its US Libor counterpart for the first time since 2017. On Wednesday, the gap widened back to 21 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While interest rates on various fixed deposits have risen in the past months, the city's commercial banks in Hong Kong have yet to raise their prime lending rates. The Hibor rate is likely to stay below Libor as liquidity in the city is likely to stay relatively supported, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has been raising benchmark rates in lockstep with the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> since the current tightening cycle got underway in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In interventions in April and May, the monetary authority spent around HK$70 billion to support the Hong Kong dollar, which has tightened the amount of dollars in circulation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, inflows into Hong Kong dollar assets and commercial banks that continue to refrain from raising the prime lending rates have partially offset the liquidity drain, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around the region, markets are poised for more weakness in Asian currencies, including the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar, said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy at </span><span class="s3">United Overseas Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong US growth and rising inflation indicators reinforce the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s gradual rate hiking path, boosting the US dollar and Treasury rates, Heng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">DBS Bank</span><span class="s1"> forecasts three-month Hibor to rise to 3.25 per cent by the end of 2019, up from Wednesday's 2.07 per cent level while three-month Libor was expected to hit 3.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet search giant Baidu, smartphone brand Xiaomi and Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft have agreed to subscribe with Cheetah Mobile, the security software company that plans to raise about US$200 million in its initial public offering in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts yesterday said that combined subscription, worth US$50 million, would help prop up the New York Stock Exchange-bound listing of Cheetah after the Beijing-based company - formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software - downsized its IPO from the original US$300 million that was filed earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah, a subsidiary established by Kingsoft in 2009, will offer 12 million new American depositary shares, each priced between US$12.50 and US$14.50. That would put Cheetah's market capitalisation at between US$1.8 billion and US$2.1 billion, according to its </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> filing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jeff Hao, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, said: "Timing is not on the company's side because Alibaba's own IPO will require a lot of capital from the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, the mainland's biggest e-commerce services provider, is expected to file for its share offering in New York within days. Speculation has been rife that Alibaba could raise more than US$20 billion, positioning its IPO as the largest in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1"> analyst Ricky Lai expected the Cheetah IPO to still manage to attract investors with a specific interest on the growing mobile security applications market segment. "Baidu's and Xiaomi's subscription deals would certainly help raise the company's profile," Lai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once its IPO is completed, Cheetah will issue and sell its Class A shares worth US$10 million to parent Kingsoft, US$20 million to Baidu and US$20 million to Xiaomi Ventures, the smartphone brand's venture capital unit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah has proposed adopting a dual-class share capital structure that would allow Kingsoft to retain control and continue to consolidate the unit's financial results after the IPO. This type of share structure is not available in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday, Kingsoft said the Cheetah IPO net proceeds will amount to US$147.4 million, or US$170 million if the underwriters exercise their option to buy additional shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah plans to use US$50 million of the proceeds to expand into selected international markets; US$35 million to build up its sales and marketing; US$35 million to invest in technology, infrastructure, and research and development; and the balance for general corporate purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record number of Chinese tech and internet companies are rushing to launch IPOs overseas this year, amid the looming shadow of overall tightening credit conditions, which bears a lot of similarities to the dotcom bubble and crash of 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just like what happened in the US nearly two decades ago, many of these IPOs are pushed by the need for cash amid intense funding pressure, as the cheap money era is coming to an end after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> kicked off its rate-increase cycle and there is no sign of China ending its deleveraging campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it is getting increasingly harder to access onshore money from private equity funds, companies are turning to the public equity market for financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said many tech start-ups are trying to catch the last train in the current cycle like what the Chinese internet portals did in 2000, as the issue of survival has become all the more important when winter finally comes. To grab the window of opportunity, many would rather risk a valuation cut and stock volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If history is any guide, today's breed of tech and internet companies could face a similar turnaround in fortunes and experience traumatic changes, leaving only the fittest to survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, 13 Chinese tech and internet service-related IPOs launched this year, raising a combined US$6.86 billion as of September 21 - the highest on booth counts since 1995, according to Dealogic data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The data has not taken into account one of the largest flotations of the year - Xiaomi's US$4.7 billion IPO, which Dealogic categorised as a smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f17fde44-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO wave is part of an overall listing boom. In the first eight months of this year, 150 companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange, up 46 per cent year on year, based on data from the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is in sharp contrast to the market sentiment that has changed significantly from earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since July, nearly 60 per cent of IPOs have fallen below their offer price on the first day of trading. The eight biggest tech IPOs in the past 12 months are all trading below their IPO prices. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, China's biggest online car retailer, has seen its shares plunge nearly 70 per cent from its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index recently entered a technical bear market, reaching a low of 26,613 earlier this month, down more than 20 per cent from a high of 33,484 on January 26. It has since risen, closing at 27,788.52 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f1cfca08-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even retail investors' enthusiasm towards big listings has faded. Online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s IPO earlier this month was barely subscribed by retail buyers, who placed only HK$2.6 billion (US$332.2 million) worth of orders. That is less than one per cent of the HK$370 billion capital that Ping An Good Doctor tied up in its IPO in May. It also pales in comparison with China Literature's HK$520 billion lock-in retail capital last November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But bankers said the IPO window in Hong Kong is still open and will probably stay open for another year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect a healthy IPO pipeline in Hong Kong over the next six to 12 months, despite macro-driven market volatility,” said Sunil Dhupelia, head of equity syndicate for Asia ex-Japan at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese companies, primarily in the TMT [telecommunication, media, and technology] sector, feature prominently in the pipeline.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Hall, co-head of investment banking for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, had similar views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is still a robust IPO pipeline and the momentum is strong. Instead of postponing their IPO agenda, most issuers want to be prepared to catch the right market window. The recent volatility has made investors more selective but they remain tremendously enthusiastic for companies with a solid business model.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance, a leading home-grown investment bank advising on tech IPOs, said the window to list in Hong Kong is open, partly because of the new listing rules that took effect in April. The rules allow companies with dual-class share structure to list and also make it easier for biotech firms to launch their IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“2018 is a bumper year for IPOs. I believe next year will also be [the same],” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dennis Wu, CEO of Hong Kong-based Futu Securities, expected the current IPO boom to last till November and quieten a bit in December, before heating up again next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Hong Kong is among the top IPO destinations in the world and is an open market with free capital flows. “As long as the issuers are good companies at reasonable valuations, you don't need worry about the market's holding capacity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this unprecedented wave of IPOs has been fuelled by the rapid strides taken by Chinese tech firms in the past four to five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few years, many of these firms have made great progress supported by financing from private equity funds. They have matured and reached the IPO stage,” said Bao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin Sha, an analyst at China Industrial Securities, said China's mobile phone penetration rate had surged to 54 per cent in 2017 from 41 per cent in 2014, fuelling a rapid growth in the start-ups offering products or services related to the mobile internet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of these start-ups have seen explosive growth, attracting enormous amounts of private capital amid hefty expectations about their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is similar to how many big internet portals rose in the early 2000s amid the internet revolution back then,” she wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this year, the Chinese private equity market, an important source of funds for start-ups, has tightened significantly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first six months, money raised by private equity funds and venture capital firms plunged 56 per cent year on year on the back of China's ongoing deleveraging efforts, weak domestic equity market, and a slowdown in economic growth complicated by the impact of the trade war with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f21ac92c-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's really hard to access onshore money from private equity funds now,” said Ashley Li, head of asset management at Ping An Securities. “Many LPs [limited partners] have no additional capital to invest [in PE funds], and some even want to cash in on their existing investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Hong Kong-based Partners Capital International, said a large number of PE funds set up in 2013 and 2014 have reached their harvesting phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A PE fund usually has an investment period of three to five years before it exits the portfolio companies. That has caused many PE funds to take the companies they back to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the companies themselves, it becomes imperative to find other sources of funding when uncertainties are on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Tech companies usually need constant blood transfusion in the early stages when they are yet to make a profit and need to keep burning money to support their expansion,” Wan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When winter comes in the current capital market cycle, the most important thing is to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kai Fang, managing director and head of equity capital market at China Renaissance, said it is better for issuers to grab the window of opportunity sooner rather than later given the uncertainties, as long as the company meets the requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We don't know what will happen in the future. Maybe you can't sell [the IPO] at the highest price now, but the top priority is to get it done. No one can predict whether it will become better in the future. So why not now?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there are several motives behind a company's desire to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An IPO is so much more than just going public. It means a company can access more financing channels, boost its reputation and attract talent, and have a stronger bargaining position when talking to clients or even creditors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bruce Wu, co-head of </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1">'s Greater China equity capital markets group, agreed it is important to grab the window as long as it's open.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The volatility may cause issuers to recalibrate their timing, but they will persist with their plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This unprecedented IPO wave has rekindled memories of what happened 18 years ago when the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> crashed after reaching a peak of 5,048 in March 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting in June 1999, amid the dotcom boom, the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its benchmark rate six times within one year, from 4.75 per cent to 6.5 per cent in May 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around that time, the US stock market embraced a concentrated IPO wave. 115 and 112 companies went public in 1999 and 2000 respectively, compared to the annual average of 72 between 1991 and 1996, according to data compiled by China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's four biggest internet portals at the time - China.com, Sina.com, NetEase and </span><span class="s3">Sohu.com</span><span class="s1"> - also listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> from July 1999 to July 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the bursting of the dotcom bubble in March 2000 hit IPOs hard. Not only did NetEase and Sohu have to briefly postpone their listing plans and cut fundraising targets, but also saw their shares drop quickly as the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> plummeted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> lost nearly 80 per cent of its value from its peak to a low of 1,114 in 2002, a period which many people call as the internet's nuclear winter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list itself is a success,” Wang Zhidong, founder and then CEO of Sina, said in an interview with Beijing Youth Daily in 2000. “We caught the last train. The window was closing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Zhang, CEO of Sohu, was then quoted as saying that it was not as if the company would have died had it not listed. “But the IPO significantly increased our chances of survival.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2161035/xiaomis-share-surge-falls-victim-investor-worries-over-outlook]Eighteen years later, those comments resonate with Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list is a huge success for Xiaomi, given the volatility on the capital market,” Lei said in an open letter in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi raised US$4.7 billion in Hong Kong, the largest tech flotation of the year. But the fundraising value had to be cut by almost half from its initial target, as the company and banks became cautious amid a weak market and lacklustre investor interest. Its shares currently trade below its offer price, falling victim to worries over the outlook for Chinese tech firms and the US-China trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analysts agreed that what is going on now bears some resemblance to the past in terms of the funding environment for tech companies.In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will surviveBao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although I don't think it will be as destructive as the bursting of the bubble back then, we need to be aware of a possible sharp turnaround in expectations for the new breed of tech and internet companies,” Wan from Partners Capital said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a tech company mainly relies on burning cash to support its business without a viable business model, it easily dies when the environment becomes harsher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The end of the dotcom boom saw about 210 US internet companies go bankrupt because of the broken capital chain, as it was hard to access financing, according to data from China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the bubble in the tech sector burst in the 2000s, many companies experienced a painful transformation, as their valuations were reassessed,” said Lin from the Chinese securities firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those that survived bear three key characteristics: cautious investments, cost control, and how fast the company can monetise its traffic and achieve earnings, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fan from China Renaissance holds similar views, as he sees the ability to manage cash flows important to the survival of a tech company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will survive.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong medical services company </span><span class="s3">C-Mer Eye Care Holdings</span><span class="s1"> opened 82 per cent higher on its trading debut on Monday, pointing to the possibility of a positive environment for initial public offerings that may be planned for the city this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in the company, which operates eye clinics, opened at HK$5.35, above its IPO price of HK$2.90 and the marketed range of HK$2.35 to HK$2.90. It was trading at HK$5.16 by mid-morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">C-Mer, which counts Tencent Holdings chairman Pony Ma as a cornerstone investor, is raising a net HK$521.3 million (US$66.6 million). The retail share offer was increased to 98.5 million shares from 19.7 million under the exchange's clawback rule, which allows shares to be reallocated to retail investors if demand exceeds the original allocation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO was oversubscribed by more than 1,500 times, locking up about HK$89.9 billion of funds. The proceeds will go to establishing three new eye hospitals in China as well to the possible acquisition of existing eye hospitals in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The surge in C-Mer's stock came as Hong Kong's benchmark stock index rose above its historical closing record price of 31,638.23 set on October 30, 2007, though it was still shy of the intraday record high of 31,958.41 set on the same day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said optimism in Hong Kong's markets was rising after the founder of the world's largest e-commerce shopping platform, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, said he would consider listing its shares on the local bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That comment followed the announcement of a plan to change Hong Kong's listing rules to attract more companies, particularly those with dual-class share structures. The exchange's previous rule to bar companies with such structures was the reason Alibaba had originally rejected Hong Kong for its listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes are likely to kick in by mid 2018, attracting more well-known Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">OCBC Bank</span><span class="s1"> said in a research note. This new wave of IPOs is likely to suck in more funds and push up Hong Kong dollar interest rates this year, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other recent new listings in Hong Kong did not fare so well on Monday. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, an online car-loan provider backed by Tencent, fell 0.9 per cent to HK$6.75, and has been trading below its IPO price since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Computer game accessories maker </span><span class="s3">Razer Inc</span><span class="s1"> fell 0.8 per cent to HK$3.88, similar to its IPO price in November.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) reported a 49 per cent rise in profit for the first quarter, thanks to higher turnover and more new listings, sending its shares up as much as 2 per cent on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, which has just completed its largest listing reforms in three decades in a bid to attract more companies, posted net profit of HK$2.56 billion (US$326.12 million) for the first quarter, up from HK$1.72 billion in the same period a year ago and a record for a single quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results beat expectations of a net profit of HK$2.31 billion in a poll of analysts by </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">. Earnings per share is HK$2.07.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has revamped its listing rules to try and make itself more attractive as a listing destination, particularly for big technology firms, which will now be allowed to list if they have dual-class share structures. However some analysts cautioned that the outlook for the bourse may not be so rosy in the current three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Turnover and new listings were high in the first quarter,” saidChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services industry, who is also a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the outlook for the second quarter may not be so optimistic. Turnover has gone down recently as markets globally are volatile, while the number of applications under the new listing regime is slower than expected. These factors would affect the result of the HKEX in the second quarter,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">'s new listing rules draw just two applications, far fewer than expected[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145145/hong-kongs-new-listing-rules-draw-just-tickle-applications-far]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX shares rose as much as 2 per cent in the afternoon session after the release of its earnings, before closing at HK$257, up 0.31 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First-quarter profit was the highest for a single quarter at HKEX since its establishment in 2000, and was lifted by a 96 per cent rise in trading fee income to HK$676 million from improved turnover. Average daily turnover stood at HK$146 billion during the first three months this year, up 97 per cent from HK$74.3 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 10 per cent in January to reach a record high of 33,484 points on January 29, before falling back in the following two months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fees meanwhile rose by a total of HK$28 million, with a HK$16 million increase inannual listing fees from a higher number of listed companies and a HK$12 million increasein initial listing fees due to more IPOs. There were 69 new listings on the main board and the GEM second board for growth firms in the first quarter, up from 40 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">a&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A jump in revenue from the two Stock Connect schemes that link the Hong Kong bourse with its Shanghai and Shenzhen counterparts to facilitate two-way trading also helped the HKEX in the first quarter. The schemes brought in combined revenue at HK$172 million, more than double the HK$75 million in the same period last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> would cut the number of partners the firm has and bind them to a three-year share sale ban if Hong Kong regulators accept a controversial management structure that is blocking its potential HK$100 billion initial public offering, a source close to the listing authorities told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal had been floated to the stock exchange's listing committee ahead of a regular meeting tomorrow, but no formal listing application had yet been submitted, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is aimed at showing that Alibaba is willing to make concessions," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source close to the Securities and Futures Commission said such a concession was unlikely to be enough to persuade the authorities to accept the Alibaba structure. "Alibaba will still not give up its demand to nominate the majority of board directors, which still gives more power to certain shareholders than others. That is unacceptable to the SFC," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Share lock-ups for executives are not uncommon in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had no comment, but a source close to the company said talks were continuing and constructive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The e-commerce giant's planned listing is in limbo over its management's determination to maintain a partnership structure that regulators worry gives top executives more rights than ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources close to Alibaba insist the firm does not want a dual share structure or a change to rules. Instead, it is seeking an exemption under an existing rule that is part of the Hong Kong listing code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun revealed fresh details about the partnership scheme earlier this month that analysts saw as being designed to soothe concerns. The scheme started in 2010 and had elected 28 partners over a three-round selection process following strict eligibility criteria.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and his top executives own about 10 per cent of the company, compared with about 24 per cent owned by United States internet firm </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and about 37 per cent by Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment bankers who have met Ma have told him that a New York listing would be his best bet for securing the control he craves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival, Nasdaq, are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial experts say, however, that Alibaba has missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and it may have only until the end of this month before the same happens in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any later and the application would be subject to new rules that come into effect on October 1, obliging firms to allow at least two months between the date of a sponsor's formal appointment and a listing application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said after the first anniversary ceremony of its joint venture with the two mainland stock exchanges yesterday that the city's listing rules were working well and there was no reason to change them to accommodate dual share structures, in the latest sign that the regulatory stand-off remains unresolved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked about the status of the potential listing of Alibaba, Li reiterated that Hong Kong's listing regime was designed to protect all shareholders equally, underscoring the reservations that the regulators have about the company's structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Alibaba, China's e-commerce giant, made its monumental debut with a 38 per cent jump in value on its first day of trading on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on Friday, it is hard not to be awed by the enormous wealth its chairman, Jack Ma Yun, has created for himself, his employees and investors - the focus of intensive media frenzy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded by the former English teacher in his Hangzhou flat 15 years ago, the company raised US$21.8 billion in one of the largest initial public offerings the world has seen, valuing the company at US$231 billion, surpassing </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and Amazon and becoming the world's second largest internet company after </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on Friday's closing price of US$93.89, Ma's remaining stake of 7.8 per cent was worth more than US$18 billion, easily making him the mainland's richest man and among the wealthiest in Asia. As fireworks went off at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou to celebrate the listing, it has also made many of its young employees US dollar millionaires.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But wealth creation is only one of many far-reaching implications of the Alibaba IPO as foreign investors bet on the company as the latest vehicle to tap China's explosive growth of e-commerce and internet use despite the concerns over the firm's management structure and government interference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing has firmly placed Alibaba, which until now was not well known outside China, on the global stage for future expansion in overseas markets, even though Ma said the company would continue to focus on the market at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, it also reflects the rise of a new wave of technology giants to propel the Chinese economy forward as the government seeks greater reliance on innovation and domestic consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the latest e-commerce giant to gain attention abroad following the rise of Lenovo, the world's largest maker of personal computers; Baidu, China's largest search engine company; </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest maker of networking equipment; and Tencent, owner of the popular </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> messaging service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another important feature one can't fail to notice is that all these tech giants are privately owned in an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises with monopolies or cartels in banking, energy, telecoms and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Entrepreneurs like Alibaba's Ma, Tencent's Pony Ma and Robin Li of Baidu reflect the fact that the private sector is not only a jobs creator, but contributes more than 60 per cent to China's overall economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's trading platforms have helped create millions of jobs on the mainland as self-employed entrepreneurs set up online shops to tap a user base of several hundred million people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, Alibaba's blockbuster success is set to trigger deep soul-searching for mainland regulators and investors alike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most Chinese tech giants have sought their primary listings in New York, except Tencent and Lenovo, which listed in Hong Kong. Regulatory hurdles and the low-risk appetite of investors on the mainland have driven the best tech firms away from its stock markets, depriving small investors of the chance to buy into those high-growth companies directly even though they contribute to the bulk of their profits as users and consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, Hong Kong was the preferred choice for Alibaba's IPO but it was forced to choose New York because Hong Kong does not offer dual-class share structures - a move local regulators are now reviewing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact that foreign investors are the biggest winners from Alibaba's IPO has also shown that China still has a long way to go in building up its own venture capital markets and financing its own hi-tech development and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is true that the sovereign fund </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> and several private investment firms linked to relatives of former government leaders will reap generous payouts from Alibaba's listing, but their stakes in the company are tiny compared to those of </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and Japan's </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1">, which earned much more as the firm's biggest shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> placed their faith in Ma by investing in Alibaba in its early days at a time when he was spurned by investors at home and abroad.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council proposed yesterday the creation of several new listing boards, including one specialising in companies with unique shareholding structures, in a widely anticipated report which came after the city lost the mega initial public coffering of e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> to New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We recommend that Hong Kong's policymakers, stock exchange and regulators should conduct an overall review on how to change our regulation and market structure to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness to capture companies to have their IPOs here," said Bonnie Chan, the policy research committee member of the council, the government's highest level financial services advisory group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By introducing specialised listing boards, Chan said it would "enable better matching between different types of issuers and investors" and "accommodate innovations in shareholding and management structure". This would help Hong Kong to develop as a hub for firms in specific industries such as mining and natural resources, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A board recognising special shareholder structures would be welcomed by the likes of Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> which all have unique shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laurence Li, convenor of the council's policy research committee, denied the changes are aimed at being tailor-made for any individual firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock through train scheme is implemented later this year, it will attract more companies to list here. We need to make sure our markets are ready for that," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba was in talks last October with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake. The exchange refused to grant an exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle, prompting Alibaba to decide last March to list in the US, where dual class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council proposed that Hong Kong follow London's lead with several markets catering to different companies and investors, including premium and standard boards for companies wanting different regulations. It also has different boards called the alternative, professional or specialist markets which appeal to different investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also looked at how to shorten the IPO period, the requirement of cornerstone investors and the mechanism to allocate shares between institutional and retail investors.</span></p>
