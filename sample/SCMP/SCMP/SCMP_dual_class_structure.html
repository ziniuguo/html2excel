<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) busies itself consulting on detailed trading rule changes, to pave the likely way for companies seeking dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, it's time to outline exactly what their inclusion in the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index would mean.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a proposal by HKEX, a one-month consultation period ends on March 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its plan is to attract three categories of new-economy companies to list here: large biotech companies without revenue, giant dual-class shareholding structured new economies companies, and US-listed mainland new-economy companies looking for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting right over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are popular among many tech firms such as US tech firm </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, and pointedly mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns South China Morning Post. The fact Hong Kong could not then offer Alibaba a dual-class structure was seen as a strong reason why the tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With several “unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion) expected to seek public funding in the not-too-distant future, such as Xiaomi, WeLab, Lufax, and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">, officials in Hong Kong are anxious not to have a repeat of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX expects to start accepting dual-class applications, soon after the end of the consultation's conclusion in late April, with the first dual-class share companies floating in the city as early as June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we still don't know whether or when successful dual-listed companies will eventually be allowed to be included in the benchmark Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's important, as many passive fund managers track the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index. If such companies were be added to these indexes, they could be accessed by a much larger pool of institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there are the Stock Connect share trading links between the Hong Kong exchange and its peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen to consider, which only allow the trading of stocks listed on the major Hang Seng Indexes (again, the Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index) to qualify, and in which mainlanders and mainland mutual funds have readily invested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong exchange's turnover comes via southbound trading over the Stock Connect links.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So if these stocks are not allowed to be included in the major indexes, mainlanders would unable to buy them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Indexes Company, which compiles the benchmark indices, completed its own public consultation on the issue, ending On February 28 - but it's still yet to publish its conclusions nearly a fortnight on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants themselves, say they still have mixed views on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers, supports the inclusion of dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index, giving a green light to mainlanders to plough into them via Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many passive fund managers, however, oppose the suggestion, as once dual-class shares are included in the leading Hang Seng indexes, they fear they would have no choice but to focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other fund managers express reservations on the dual-class structure as it violate the city's “one-share, one vote” rule - an important principle for listed companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, New York's S&amp;P and London's FTSE indexed have not included these companies in some of their indexes, as in some cases they add restrictions on calculating their weighting on a gauge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSCI, another major index complier, is also consulting the market on their inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland exchanges consider allowing them, we are going to see more of these companies listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any blanket ban on them appearing in major indexes would be unlikely - but we are likely to see some restrictions coming with such issuances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many sector the adage that “uncertainty breeds opportunity” rings true, but not in this case. Markets hate it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so it's now doubly important the Hang Seng Indexes Company and other compilers announce their final decision on dual-class shares, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange said it will explore ways to encourage start-ups and technology companies to raise capital in the city, conceding the need to tweak existing listing rules to compete with Singapore and New York to be the hub for initial stock offers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388%20&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], at a luncheon with more than 100 of the city's brokers and fund managers.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the listing advisory committee at rival </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> approved a plan to allow companies with dual-class shares to raise funds, in a move that makes the city more appealing to technology start-ups that often feature stocks with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class structure has been the subject of intense debate in Hong Kong since the bourse in 2014 missed out on a US$25 billion initial public offer by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has a dual-class structure that allows founding shareholders to nominate up to half the company's board of directors even as they own minority shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong hasn't allowed such a structure since the 1980s because the city's Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the market regulator, believes dual-class shares violate the “one share, one vote” principle and are unfair to other investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba eventually listed its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US stock market allows dual-class shares, favoured by technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">LinkedIn</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the world's largest destination for IPOs from 2009 to 2011, but lost that pole position to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2014, due to Alibaba's listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addressing the annual gathering of stockbrokers, Li neither specifically addressed the subject of allowing dual-class structure in Hong Kong, nor bring up competition with Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have our own plan and our own strategies and we will explore all possibilities,” he said. “Other stock exchanges do their own thing and we will not respond to what another exchange is doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake for Hong Kong could be another large stock offer by other startups including Alibaba's online payments unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, which investment bankers estimate could be valued as much as US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's founder Ma told the University of Macau students in June that he “very much hopes” to list </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which operates the Alipay electronic payments platform, in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong financial secretary John Tsang Chun-wah in his budget has unveiled a multibillion dollar plan to turn the city into a technology hub to nurture the development of companies including those involved in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local listing rule however are not tailored for start-ups or technology firms to raise capital in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class shares listing rules must reform to protect investors and prevent an erosion of corporate governance, the </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of people think that because dual-class shares structures work in other jurisdictions it will immediately, effortlessly translate into an APAC context,” said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1">. "We are trying to challenge some of those preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's listing rules changed in April to allow companies with dual-class shares to float on the bourse, giving founders and key management stronger voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Western countries, including the US, have had such rules in place for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, Tokyo implemented the change in 2015 and Singapore in June, but no companies have listed so far in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has traditionally been defined by a "one-share, one-vote” system, meaning all shareholders enjoy proportional representation in company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Hong Kong could not offer </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> a dual-class structure was thought to be a strong reason the Chinese tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014, and was indicative of the city losing out as an IPO destination. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms - aimed at attracting tech companies who want to maximise valuation and see their founders' vision through - have drawn two of the city's biggest tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi raised HK$54 billion (US$4.7 billion), while in September Beijing-based online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised HK$52.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in a survey carried out by </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> in March this year, 97 per cent of their members in Asia-Pacific believed safeguards were needed to protect investors from a few controlling stakeholders, according to a report published on Tuesday, named "Dual-class Shares: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong already offers an "event-based sunset”, where founders' stronger voting rights collapse if they leave the company or transfer shares. But more is needed, argued CFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global association of investment professionals recommended a mandatory "time-based sunset” where super voting rights will collapse to regular shareholder voting rights after no longer than five years post-IPO, to protect investors from a lack of control in their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insufficient investor protection was noted by 53 per cent of respondents as a key risk of dual-class shares, while 52 per cent highlighted the skewed proportionality between ownership and control, and 28 per cent identified an erosion of corporate governance standards.The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountableMary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountable,” said Leung. "No matter what public shareholders want, there is a limitation to what they can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the structure may make sense at the time of IPO, we don't believe it should carry on forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> of 157 dual-class structure IPOs in the US since the early 2000s found companies with ongoing weighted voting rights and those that allowed collapsed super voting rights, had similar valuations in the first two years after floating. From the third year, however, companies with collapsed voting rights began trading at a higher valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CFA respondents were also worried about their lack of education on how to invest in companies with dual-class share structures. The survey founds 60 per cent said they had no experience investing in such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some argue we don't need rules as we are all grown ups, in Asia because there is so much retail investment in the market when things go wrong, they look to the regulators,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Are we set up in the right way to look after these people? Investors must of course do due diligence on what they are buying, but a great deal of work can be done to raise awareness and education levels.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is Hong Kong's rival, and not Shanghai or Shenzhen, when it comes to attracting “unicorns”, according to Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Asian stock exchanges are vying with each other to change listing rules in a bid to attract new economy companies and dual-class shareholding structure firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen have never been competitors of Hong Kong as we always cooperate with each other. Tong said on the sidelines of a regulatory forum on Wednesday. “Rather, Singapore is a competitor of Hong Kong,” adding that if dual-class shareholding companies were to list in Hong Kong and in the mainland, it would be a win-win situation for both.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend that they had prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting unicorns - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and had already visited a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, chairman of </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)</span><span class="s1">, the mainland's top markets watchdog, confirmed last week that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX, said last week that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong were planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a dual-class listing structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structure allows shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian stock exchanges previously opposed such companies to list because it goes against the “one share one vote” principle. But now several exchanges are speeding up their reforms to explicitly allow dual-class shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of SFC, said at the same forum that the commission found shortcomings in the works of 31 financial firms that acted as listing sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some listing sponsors did not fulfil their duty with regards to due diligence on the companies they sponsored, falling short of the SFC requirements,” she said, adding the commission will issue a report on the matter soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also said the commission plans to study some brokers' demand to use WhatApp to take customer orders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the SFC, say they will work together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for new economy companies, adding momentum to the proposed new stock market for dual class shares after regulators embraced a water down version of listing reforms on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform should not be seen as a power struggle between the SFC and HKEX. The two regulators and the government all want to work together to upgrade the quality of Hong Kong markets and to see that the market operates more efficiently,” said James Lau, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the listing reform package, the Securities and Futures Commission agreed to abandon its controversial proposal last year for a frontline role in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central listing approval process will remain in the hands of HKEX and its listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC also agreed to abandon a proposal to review the performance of listing division staff. The responsibility will instead remain part of the purview of HKEX executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not a climb down which is a wrong way to describe the conclusion. We are listening to comments and consider the current approach more effective,” said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The conclusion will clarify the roles of SFC and HKEX in vetting new listings. Many problems happen after companies get listed. This is why post-listing enforcement is important,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog's retreat on new share listings paves way for dual-class shares [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2111201/securities-watchdogs-retreat-new-share-listings-paves-way]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will retain its role in setting listing policies, while a 12 member advisory panel will support the listing committee in setting policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government and the SFC and the stock exchange are open minded to carefully study how to carry out reforms to make sure our market could attract new economies to list here while at the same time we protect the interest of investors,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The water downed listing reforms come after a five-month controversial consultation last year, which received 8,500 submissions from brokers, listed companies and financial professionals. Ninety-four per cent of respondents were against the proposed reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said the listing reform result was a blow to the SFC and a victory for the HKEX and would likely help pave way for the launch of a third board supporting dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 the HKEX pushed for a consultation process on whether to launch dual class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX completed a two month consultation on the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board was among the top agenda items at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in August, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are listed in the US under a dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate over the dual share concept thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when Chinese e-commerce juggernaut </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> , which has a dual-class structure, opted to list its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class stock structure allows the issuing of various types of shares by a single company, where the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multiple classes of shares among their shareholders may be allowed to raise capital in Hong Kong by the middle of 2018, as the city's Securities&amp;Futures Commission (SFC) backs away from its position on the "One Share, One Vote" principle, which has been a pillar of the local capital market since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A pilot scheme will be launched next year, whereby certain start-up companies that have attained the so-called unicorn status - valuations exceeding US$1 billion - will be allowed to raise capital on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange through initial public offerings, if they put in place sufficient investor protection provisions, two sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The protection provisions may include a sunset clause that compels the companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stocks listed under this pilot programme will also need to be designated with a special code to distinguish them from other listed companies, for reminding investors to be aware of potential risks, the source said. The pilot plan could be widened if sufficient number of high-quality companies are attracted to Hong Kong without regulatory problems, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's about-turn is a major step forward in helping Hong Kong compete with global capital markets including New York, Singapore and Shanghai, especially in attracting technology and new economy companies to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for companies to raise funds this year, falling behind New York and Shanghai. Between January and June, the city's stock market raised US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, a drop of 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised in the same period in 2016, when it was ranked as the leader for new listings worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> pushed for a consultation to launch dual-class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections by the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the SFC in 2014 opposed exemption for </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, to list in Hong Kong. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source said the SFC was supporting Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who in August signalled the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC and the government also want to see dual-class shares listed on the main board instead of a proposed separate board, as they do not want to see a fragmented market structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange is likely to announce the pilot scheme in the coming weeks, the second source said. It will hold a second round of detailed rule changes for this pilot scheme before dual-class shares can be listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may amend its listing rules to accept companies with dual class shares and biotech companies with no revenue as early as late April, accelerating the timeline for the widely-expected listing regime change by several months, the bourse operator said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January predicted the listing rules could be amended from June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We bring the reform forward to late April as it would allow the listing of these companies in the summer period when June to August are active months,” Li said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have discussed this reform for a long time and a lot of issues have consensus already. We do not need the normal two months of consultation and could speed the process up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange on Friday issued a consultation paper detailing the proposed rule changes that will enable some companies with multiple-class share structures to list on the Hong Kong stock market, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation will last for one month, officially drawing to a close on March 23, while the consultation conclusion would be made in late April, officials said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Upon the issuance of the consultation conclusion and the implementation of the listing rules, the exchange will accept formal applications under the new regime,” the exchange said. Companies are welcome to make informal inquiries to the exchange ahead of the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few months we have collectively decided to take a big step forwards as a financial centre and welcome emerging and innovative companies. Now we are proposing a listing regime that will boost Hong Kong's attractiveness for a new generation of companies as well as investors, bringing more dynamism to our stock market,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said he supported the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The proposals are reasonable and can offer shareholder protection. It is particularly important that biotech companies must not change their principal business without prior approval by the exchange,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the HKEX, following an industry consultation, decided to proceed with reforms to allow dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, as long as the companies have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$10 billion (US$1.29 billion) and annual revenue of HK$1 billion. Companies that have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion would be exempt from the revenue requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our new secondary listing regime welcome both Chinese and international companies to apply,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies already listed under the dual-class share structure such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> or Baidu in the US, could apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong while maintaining their current structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If their share trading volume exceeds 55 per cent in Hong Kong, they could be classed as a dual primary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech companies taking advantage of the new listing regime would need to have a minimum market cap of HK$1.5 billion and be limited to sophisticated investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the exchange did not accept calls made by some fund managers for a sunset clause that would see the dual class structure expire after a period of years, or undergo a general vote by shareholders for renewal. The exchange said the rule would be too restrictive and prompt companies to look towards other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A sunset clause with an expiry date would create uncertainty for both companies and investors. It would be difficult for the companies to have long term development,” Li said. “It is also hard to determine what time frame would be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among safeguards to protect minority investors, some shareholder votes would be conducted on the basis of one share one vote. This would apply to issues involving the appointment and removal of independent directors and auditors, changes to constitutional documents, changes to the rights of any class of shares, and the winding up of the company, the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual class shares will have a “W” stock marker while biotech firms will have a “B” at the end of their share name to help investors identify their features.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's decision to list in New York has dealt a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange as the highly anticipated listing of China's e-commerce giant is critical for Asia's vibrant capitalist hub to reclaim the global crown for initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a genuine loss for Hong Kong after Alibaba picked the US market to host its long-awaited [listing], which could be the swing factor for global bourses to attain the status of the world's largest listing hub for the year," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY, a professional services firm. "With an expected sizeable share sale, Alibaba's listing can easily be a game changer for Hong Kong, where fast-growing technology firms remain a minority group in the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s US$16 billion flotation in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital raised in Hong Kong's listing market rose 88 per cent year on year to HK$169 billion last year, making it one of the top three listing hubs globally. But the city has struggled to win prominent deals, partly due to a slowdown in listings of international companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Lee, a lawyer at </span><span class="s3">Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft</span><span class="s1">, said Hong Kong still could not get rid of its image as the "listing venue" for mainland-based companies. In one notable example, the Glazer family, owner of Manchester United, had once considered listing the English football club in Hong Kong or Singapore in 2011 before it picked New York as it insisted on adopting a dual-class structure to retain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants agreed that it was time for Hong Kong to review its listing regime but it needed to strike a balance with good corporate governance and investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fund manager with a British fund house said the city should defend the "one share, one vote" system since the overall corporate governance in most Asian countries remained largely behind international standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers said it was natural for Alibaba to list in the United States since the infrastructure, valuations and liquidity there gave it a leg up on Hong Kong, but they argued that the mainland internet giant might still consider a secondary listing in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A total of US$3.8 billion was raised in the US equity markets by mainland technology firms since 2013, compared with US$2.7 billion in Hong Kong, according to Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said: "Theoretically, it is still possible for Alibaba to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange since the firm has not filed any official document to the US regulators, or the firm may choose to do a secondary listing in Hong Kong if the rules permit."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee concurred, saying there was no absolute guarantee that Alibaba would not seek a secondary listing since it had just started working on the US application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital market is getting more sophisticated as well-established companies are offered to list their shares in different jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft, a mainland software firm, is looking to raise about US$300 million through a spin-off of its security software business in the US. The company is also proposing a dual-class structure that would allow it to retain control after the offering.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has edged closer to allowing companies with a dual-class share structure to list on the stock exchange after the regulator backed plans for a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) said on Thursday it supported the local bourse's proposed consultation exercise this quarter to gauge opinion on creating a third board aimed at technology start-ups and ‘new economy' firms.There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board would for the first time permit dual-share listings, which afford one class of shareholder more rights than others. Their long-standing ban in Hong Kong is widely seen as a barrier to potentially lucrative initial public offerings, particularly by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's decision to back the move represents a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it considered the proposal at the time did not carry sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January suggested launching a new third board with more relaxed listing rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board aims to attract three types of entity - infrastructure companies, start-ups and dual-shareholding firms. Li said on Wednesday the consultation paper would be ready soon for SFC approval before it is launched this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC supports the consultation to allow the public to share their views on the dual-shareholding structure," said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC at a media lunch on Thursday. "The SFC will be open minded to listen to the market comments. However, the regulator will only agree with any listing rule changes if it would develop the market and provide sufficient investor protection measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC took a different attitude to the consultation this time around because the dual shareholding companies would only be listed on the third board. Two years ago, the proposed changes would have applied to companies listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also need to consider the worldwide trend," he said. Singapore's stock exchange last October said it planned to consult the market on allowing dual shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using a dual-class structure, which is permitted in the United States. It is favoured by many start-ups because their founders often hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to allow such listings on the grounds that they would violate the long-held principle of "one share, one vote".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request to allow what it considered a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has since said that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs of new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players have mixed views on the issue, with listed firms and investment bankers preferring a dual-share structure while fund managers generally oppose it as they believe it is not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needs," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, who support the dual-share proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the third board consultation should be accompanied by a review of the role of the GEM, Hong Kong's second board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999 with the intention to attract technology firms to list, but it has failed to do so, now acting only as a stepping stone for smaller firms while they wait to grow big enough to move to the main board. Many new listings on the GEM have seen their share prices fluctuate wildly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After setting up the third board, we need to find a new role for GEM. Many companies only take GEM as a short cut to list on the main board. We need to make changes to address the problems of this market," Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scramble by mainland China's two stock markets to lure foreign-funded technology firms is firmly back on track, as its financial regulators revisit their plan to create a fast track mechanism for share offerings by what many consider will be the profitmaking stars of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this time, their on-off-on-again plan - first revealed way back in 2001 - is set to have greater substance, say commentators, since the leadership is more determined than ever to inject some entrepreneurial vigour into the economy to drive long-term growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will ratchet up the pressure on Hong Kong, as a tug of war over listing resources gradually takes the strain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend it has prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting “unicorns” - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and has already visited to a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invited them to Shanghai, so they can gain first-hand experience (of our facilities and systems),” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are also reaching out to help them overcome difficulties in accessing the capital markets,” it added, without casting a light on any actual names.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's top securities regulators, including chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, confirmed last week too that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's own securities regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), and its stock exchange are also conducting the city's largest listing reforms in decades, aimed at enhancing the bourse's attractiveness to technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June, large biotech companies, for instance, without strong revenue track records as well as more mainstream technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures will be allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That dual-class share structure, will allow shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends, and is favoured by many tech founders as the majority hold minority stakes but still want to maintain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> (which owns the South China Morning Post) chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC quickly recognised the competitive pressures this put the city under in attracting listings by new-economy companies, and threw its weight last December behind its own proposed listing reforms, that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology firms being courted by both exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland have chosen to list A-shares only - yuan-denominated shares bought and traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges - because of the domestic market's higher valuations and the convenience,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expect to this see-saw game between the two markets[Hong Kong and the mainland] intensifying in coming years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, a would-be, fast track listing mechanism proposed to be launched in 2015 was seen as a winning formula which underlined its efforts to set up a dedicated board for emerging industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was put on ice after a summer stock market rout exacerbated regulator worries about a further slide in key economic indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That board was particularly designed to welcome relistings by privatised Chinese tech firms, which had previously traded in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Foxconn Industrial Internet - a unit of the world's largest contract manufacturer whose products include Apple's iPhones - received the go-ahead from the CSRC to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai, just five short weeks after it filed an application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The green light granted to the 27 billion yuan (US$4.27 billion) fundraising was the clearest sign yet that the CSRC is now prioritising technology IPOs as a way of bolstering the country's levels of technical innovation - a key component of the Chinese leadership's attempt to create an economy reliant on slower, but more sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the country's promising start-ups have been backed in the past by foreign private equity and venture capital funds, under the so-called VIE (variable interest entity) structure, and could only list in markets such as Hong Kong and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A VIE structure allows founders and investment funds to set up offshore vehicles which can sign contracts with Chinese firms, giving the latter effective control of the resultant offshore vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To woo VIE firms into an A-share listing, regulators now need to amend securities and corporate laws and revise domestic listing rules, as direct investment in China's A-share market is off-limits to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange says it has already started putting together a blueprint to attract IPOs by foreign companies, particularly “red chips”, or mainland companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, but with controlling Chinese shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Shanghai exchange officials said its fresh initiative to attract technology-leading IPOs has the solid backing of the Chinese leadership, further north in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of their agenda is clearly creating the next generation of tech behemoths on a par with established leaders such as Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, with the full backing of the domestic capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the Shanghai exchange beating its Hong Kong counterpart in terms of value for IPOs for the first time last year, the signs are strong that more investors could well take the bait.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has been the world's second largest initial public offering (IPO) market by value over the past two decades, driven mainly by the listing here of a swathe of mainland companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is one sector in particular that the market has largely failed to attract strong applicant interest from, technology and new economy companies, which continues to be dominated by New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong was the world's largest IPO market by value last year, raising US$24.53 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 1997, the city languished in eighth place, when new listings were worth just US$5.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past two decades it has topped the global IPO list in 2015, and from 2009 to 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a running total, over those 20 years, some US$388 billion has been raised in Hong Kong up to the first quarter of 2017, ranking it second over that timescale to New York, which remains well ahead at US$675.8 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/7c3dfdcc-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arguably the missed listing that hurt officials in Hong Kong the most was that of mainland China e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which chose the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> to host the world's largest IPO to date, for US$25 billion in 2014. Alibaba now owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But on the flipside, Hong Kong has also scored notable victories over its Manhattan rival, hosting the world's second and third biggest floats: </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1"> of China's US$22.1 billion listing in 2010 and </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$21.96 billion offering in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Prior to 1997, the Hong Kong stock market was dominated by traditional Hong Kong-based companies, such as British conglomerates or local companies in the utilities, finance, real estate or trading sectors," said Johnson Chui, the managing director and head of Asia-Pacific equity capital markets at Credit Suisse.Prior to 1997, the Hong Kong stock market was dominated by traditional Hong Kong-based companies, such as British conglomerates or local companies in the utilities, finance, real estate or trading sectorsJohnson Chui, managing director and head of Asia-Pacific equity capital markets, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Today, it is an international hub, playing an important role of being the gateway to China."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese companies have dominated Hong Kong's IPO market, last year raising HK$156.6 billion in the city, representing 82 per cent of all listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of 2016, 1,002 mainland Chinese firms were listed in Hong Kong, representing half the bourse's total 2,009 companies. They represented 63 per cent of the total market capitalisation and 69 per cent of turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong will continue to play a leading role as an important gateway for Chinese companies to access international markets - but Hong Kong will need to adapt to the rapid changes taking place in the markets," Chui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, on June 16 issued a public consultation on the proposal to launch a New Board, or the so-called Third Board - on top of the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (for growth companies that do not fulfil the requirements of profitability or track record) - with more flexible rules to attract tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/83dad30c-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Board will have two markets - one for mega companies that match all the main board requirements but who cannot list here because they have dual-class stock structures, while the other will be for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class structure refers to when a company issues various types of shares with different voting rights - favoured by many technology firms as their founders usually hold minority stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bans companies with such a structure while the US allows them to list, which is one reason why Hong Kong has previously lost out to some technology offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation process for the New Board will last for two months. If it gains enough support, the HKEX will issue a second consultation on detailed rules of the New Board which may then be launched sometime next year.Hong Kong's well-oiled IPO process and stable regulatory regimes are also key reasons why investors and Chinese companies favour the Hong Kong marketChristopher Laskowski, managing director and head of corporate and investment banking, Citi Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial firms still dominate the Hong Kong market with 69 per cent of the funds raised last year, while tech firms accounted for a mere 3 per cent, according to consulting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui, the managing director of Hantec Pacific, has no doubt Hong Kong's role as a platform for raising funds for mainland companies will continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we have a biased profile for our IPO market. We focus very much on attracting Chinese companies - particularly mainland banks and brokers. We haven't done well in attracting international firms to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, the chief executive at Capital Link International, said the ability of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares companies and attract technology firms are the key issues for Hong Kong's IPO market in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The exchange needs to be innovative and prove it can adapt and evolve as fast and efficiently as the companies they wish to attract to list. There is no upside to cutting-edge technology companies listing on outdated exchanges that have not recognised the times are changing," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/8826e5e0-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Laskowski, the managing director and head of corporate and investment banking at Citi Hong Kong, says Chinese companies like to list in Hong Kong as they can gain access to international markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their numbers are increasing all the time via the two Stock Connect cross-border share-trading schemes, which allow mainlanders to buy stocks in listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through the schemes, the so-called Southbound investment represented 9 per cent of all Hong Kong turnover in the first quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong's well-oiled IPO process and stable regulatory regimes are also key reasons why investors and Chinese companies favour the Hong Kong market," Laskowski said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Depending as strongly as the Hong Kong market does on mainland business, and being linked so inextricably with it, the city will naturally be affected by any slowdown of the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A number of corporate governance issues have arisen involving China companies although we believe they remain company specific, rather than market wide," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But as projects eventually become reality within the Chinese government's flagship "Belt and Road Initiative", which is dominated by the building and financing of infrastructure projects in some 65 countries, Laskowski is hopeful too that many of the companies involved will be looking to Hong Kong for their funding choices, ensuring its strong IPO traffic levels will continue unabated, and become even more diversified.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After being snubbed by mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba for its huge initial public offering, the city's financial officials have been engaged in serious soul-searching. As the IPO market is the lifeblood of the Hong Kong stock exchange, it's understandable its bosses want listing rules to be as competitive as those of premier investment hubs like New York and London to attract newcomers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stumbling block has been the long-standing "one share, one vote" rule, from which Alibaba had wanted to be exempted to retain control of its board membership. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> made the right decision not to bend the rule for Alibaba. But it does not mean the rule itself should not be reviewed and changed in future. This is why the exchange is now seeking public views on whether to allow potential listing companies to have special shareholding structures that would have allowed Alibaba to list in Hong Kong rather than New York. The exchange says it is keeping an open mind and does not have a fixed position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation followed proposals made by the Financial Services Development Council, which included changing the rule for the main board or creating new boards for companies, especially hi-tech ones that tend to favour so-called dual-class share structures to retain management control. On the surface, "one share, one vote" seems fair and sensible. In reality, it does not really affect ordinary retail investors, who rarely accumulate a big enough stake in a company to make a difference. Such fights are usually between significant minority shareholders like fund managers and company management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The jury is still out on whether a dual-class structure is good or bad for shareholder returns. </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, Warren Buffett's </span><span class="s3">Berkshire Hathaway</span><span class="s1"> and London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> all have similar such share structures, and their returns speak for themselves. On the other hand, a joint </span><span class="s3">Wharton School</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Harvard Business School</span><span class="s1"> study found that while large ownership stakes in managers' hands tend to strengthen corporate performance, heavy voting control by insiders weakens it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It appears management quality is the key. If investors are buying into such companies, they are placing their trust in their managers for superior returns. Otherwise, they should avoid investing in them. But there is no reason why Hong Kong investors should not have this choice.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said he supports proposals to launch a new board for start-ups on the stock exchange, as he turns his attention to helping students to carry out research in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, whose 10-year career as a minister comes to an end on Friday, will return to where he came from - </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">. He told the Post he has no title yet but the job would involve research and teaching related to fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government a decade ago, he was dean of business management at the university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I first joined the government, I planned to work for a term of five years only, but eventually I served two terms and have worked for 10 years. It is time to make a change in my career," said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 60, now plans to focus on fintech related research and study in an effort to encourage more youngsters to innovate and develop technologies that will help banks, brokers and insurance companies to do business and provide better services more securely and at a cheaper cost.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes this kind of research will encourage more young people to establish their own start-ups. Chan's move comes at a time when proposals by the stock exchange to establish a new board to help start-ups raise funds are under consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would support the stock exchange in introducing a new board to attract start-ups and dual-share structure companies to list in Hong Kong as long as they could introduce investor protection measures to safeguard the interests of the investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) issued a consultation paper two weeks ago proposing a third board - in addition to the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market - which would have more flexible rules to attract ‘new economy' companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board would offer two markets - one for mega listings of big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, the other for start-ups. Both would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter case, Chan said the reason for this restriction on the type of investor is because "the start-up markets are risky."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the board designed for dual-class structure companies, he said if it allowed retail investors to trade, measures should be put in place to protect the investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding structures are favoured by technology giants such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> as their founders own a minority stake but want to maintain control. They issuance of two classes of shares allows the founders more voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposed third board to draw technology and new economy firms to list in the city has received a general welcome from market players, but it is too soon to tell how big a draw it will become.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board announced by the exchange in a consultation paper on Friday limits listings to technology and new economy companies, and is intended to plug the gap that the bourse's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market have not been able to fill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The board will consist of two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target large companies that match requirements for the main board but have a dual shareholding structure. US-listed firms with dual share structures can apply for a secondary listing, and retail investors will be allowed to trade in this market.</span></p>

It will have a low entry threshold and light regulatory touch. To segregate the good and poor quality companies, a delisting mechanism will be in place. Firms will be delisted if they failed to meet certain operation requirement, if their share prices fell to a certain threshold, or if they had been suspended from trading for 90 days. This market will only be opened to institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX said that overseas-listed Chinese companies with dual class structure currently banned from listing in Hong Kong, could now opt for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For the longer term, there is no reason why Hong Kong could not attract some big US technology and new economy companies to consider a secondary listing," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he acknowledged that it will be an uphill task as the US is already the largest technology market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the new board will adopt an "easy in, easy out" approach, Li stressed that "the new board will not become a farm of shell companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/6affea34-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]The new board's limitation to tech firms and start-ups aim to achieve what the Growth Enterprise Market was originally intended for when it launched in 1999, targeting the very same types of firms. Eventually, only 18 per cent of GEM firms have links to information technology, while 29 per cent operate in the consumer and services sector and 26 per cent are construction companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the top IPO market worldwide last year but only 3 per cent of funds raised were for technology companies. Five technology firms listed in Hong Kong last year, raising HK$5.7 billion (US$730 million), while the nine GEM technology companies raised only HK$800 million, far below </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">'s HK$15.9 billion, New York's HK$8.7 billion and Shenzhen ChiNext's HK$7.9 billion, according to PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's what different market players say about the third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third new board for new economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">START-UPS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-ups welcome the board but are uncertain if they would list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s internet lending and wealth management provider, Lufax is planning a listing, but is undecided on which market to IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are open-minded about the listing of Lufax. There is no concrete timetable and listing venue about the listing yet," said a spokeswoman of Ping An.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast Education</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alex Lee, a former banker who co-founded online education platform Mast Education with his mother and partners in late 2015, said he relied on his personal savings for start-up funding. While he welcomed the idea of the third board as a new fund-raising channel, his company may not opt for an offering soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Overall, it would be a good move for Hong Kong to have a new third board with the purpose to help start-ups and other new economy companies to raise funds. This would hopefully encourage more Hong Kong young people to set up their own businesses," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast, which aims to provide high school students with university-level courses to boost their learning and be prepared for examinations, has been in operation for nearly two years. It has attracted more than 1,000 users globally, with a large proportion of them from the US, Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said he would wait out till his business was bigger before considering a listing on the third board or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xero</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rod Drury, chief executive and founder of Xero in New Zealand, said unlike Xero which floated in its first year, it was rare for a start-up to go public within a year of being founded. The firm uses cloud technology to help small and medium-sized enterprises better manage their accounting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We did everything backwards. Listed first, then brought in funding from hedge funds and venture funds including </span><span class="s3">Accel</span><span class="s1">, Matrix and TVC," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He recalled that there were few options in New Zealand to secure private capital for a technology start-up when the company was set up in 2006. He and other co-founders funded the firm out of their own pockets, and then listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (</span><span class="s3">NZX</span><span class="s1">) in the first year, followed by the </span><span class="s3">Australian Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">ASX</span><span class="s1">) in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As a technology start-up that went public within our first year, we encourage exchanges and others who offer capital raising options to consider how best they can support high growth businesses like ours with options for capital to support growth," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drury is supportive of the idea of a third board as Xero's own listing has helped the company expand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JabJabX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Yue, who founded JabJabX, an app that stores and analyses data to help users hone their technique in Chinese martial arts, said he and his co-founders tapped on their personal savings of about HK$400,000 to set up the company earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would wait for the details of the third board before deciding if it would seek a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not need to rush to go public because we could find some angel investors or funds who share our mission to become our investors. We would like investors who can provide guidance to us to develop our business and to allow us to access to their network of contacts," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Listing on the stock exchange would help us to raise funds but it could not help us to expand our network. At present, the cost of bank interest rate remains low, so it is not hard to find low cost of funding," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BROKERS AND FUND MANAGERS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - the payment arm of a unit of the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which are considering listings could be potential candidates for the third board's premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange had two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but was quickly rejected by the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC). This time around, the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said they had agreed to the consultation as the listings would be limited to the new board, compared with the previous proposal that applied to the entire market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/60a5aa7e-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]Still, the dual shareholding structure will remain an issue of contention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Investments Funds Association, the industry body of fund houses in Hong Kong, is opposed to such a structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In principle, investment managers believe that "one share one vote" is a cornerstone of investor protection," said Sally Wong, chief executive of HKIFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As for the discussion about the proposed third board, we should not view this in silos, but take a holistic approach and consider the relationships between the different boards. For example, will a third board listed company be "upgraded" to the main board? Or from the start-ups to the "premium" class? If yes, what are the exit or entry mechanisms," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International said the attempt to draw sought-after technology companies to list in Hong Kong had two audiences to placate including the companies and public investor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the balance between the two was not easy to strike, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Voting control through a dual class listing system does not translate into risk nor impropriety. However, the exchange needs to make sure the individual investor's interests are both aligned and protected. The old expression buyer beware cannot be the basis of a regulatory protection campaign because nothing is more paramount in the list of priorities," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Mobius, executive chairman for Templeton Emerging Markets Group, who manages US$26 billion for clients in emerging markets including Hong Kong and mainland China, said he fully supported the HKEX consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A third listing board will give an opportunity for fintech and innovative companies to compete in Hong Kong and share in the success of Shenzhen's ChiNext which has been successful in raising capital for this rapid growing sector of our industry," Mobius said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe dual class shares if structured appropriately, that is where all the rights to the shareholders are commonly shared, will be beneficial to the market as it should allow enterprising companies listed overseas to dually list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/660f409c-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]ANALYSTS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXECUTIVES</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Defining technology firms and the corporate governance that entails would be the issues to address, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The third board concept would be a good idea to attract more technology companies to list but how to define a firm as a technology or new economy firm may be controversial. If a company is conducting online lending services, is it considered as a traditional financial firm or a new technology company?" said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner of EY, said Hong Kong needed to diversify its IPO portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many challenges to the Hong Kong market," Pogson said. "We need to be responsive to the changing financing needs of the market. However this needs to be done in an investor friendly and robust way, as at the bedrock of Hong Kong's success is the quality of process and governance that Hong Kong can bring," Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We need to ensure that are market is ready for changing business models, that we understand markets such as technology, fintech, infrastructure and other evolving financing needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of AIA Group, said international exchanges were competing to attract new listings as the capital markets and the finance industry integrate globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Creating new boards to attract companies under reduced levels of governance and less onerous listing requirements is a hot topic and one that needs to balance the commercial opportunity for the bourse itself and access opportunities for local investors with investor protection and oversight," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology driven businesses have access to many funding sources and international stock exchanges are keen not miss out on what is widely expected to continue to be a dominant sector for growing market capitalisation."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global institutional investors are urging Hong Kong not to change its listing rules even after losing the mega listing of e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to a survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those surveyed, 54 global institutional investors managing a combined US$14 trillion of assets, warned they would on average give a 19 per cent price discount to Alibaba's valuation if it lists with its special shareholders structure intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They also said they would on average put a 13 per cent discount on the Hong Kong market valuation if the city allows a non-standard shareholder structure to accommodate Alibaba-like listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong government and regulators should do nothing with the existing listing rules. The one-share-one-vote principle in Hong Kong has worked well for many years, providing all shareholders with fair treatment," said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the association, which has 100 global institutional investor members including some of the world's largest fund houses, pension funds and insurers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey, conducted on association members early this year, came after Alibaba was reported in October to be in talks with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange refused to grant the exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle. Alibaba last month said it planned to list in the US, which allows the dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba lists with the structure, 71 per cent of respondents said they would not buy the stock or buy it at a discount ranging from 5 to 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia has written several times on his blog since September on the need to relook at listing rules for "innovative" companies, but institutional investors are opposed to any change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Twenty-eight per cent of the respondents gave a "bad" rating to HKEx in its manner of handling Alibaba, compared with 2 per cent "bad" each for the SFC and the government. In comparison, 41 per cent ranked the SFC "good" in its handling of the Alibaba issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Cheng, the association's research director of mainland China and Hong Kong, said some years ago London had allowed the dual class structure but that did not lead to more listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Chan, finance partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Berwin Leighton Paisner</span><span class="s1">, said: "In the US, there is a more disclosure-oriented approach as well as a culture of litigation. Investors don't need the exchanges to protect them as much as they do in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, Ricky Chim Kim-lun and Gordon Tsui Luen-on will compete for 622 votes in a four-year term to represent Hong Kong's financial services industry in the Legislative Council. Eligible voters are stockbrokers, futures and gold traders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are all calling for reforms to change the Hong Kong market's dominance by financial services and property companies, to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are also calling for measures to reboot the broking industry, and help the smallest brokers survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A week before the September 4 election, the three candidates speak to the South China Morning Post about their thoughts on listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, 64, the incumbent lawmaker who's seeking re-election, said Hong Kong needs a new board with flexible listing rules to attract technology companies to raise funds here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), launched in 1999 to attract technology firms, was a failure," he said. "We need a new board with listing rules that are more relaxed than the main board and GEM."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its top spot as the world's largest IPO market in 2014 when Alibaba moved its record US$25 billion public offer to New York. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bars publicly traded companies with a dual shareholding structure, or shares that give shareholders unequal voting rights. That's compelled many technology companies to look instead to the US to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 22 of the 343 companies, or 6 per cent of the total, listed in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013 were technology related, Cheung said. Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If Hong Kong can find a way for dual-class structure that protects investors, I would support it," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government should work with Chinese regulators to let local brokers sign on new clients on the mainland, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a small market with a population of only 7 million," he said. "If Hong Kong brokers can go north to open accounts for clients on the mainland, it would be very helpful."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsui, 56, a former banker who joined the securities industry in 2000, is now managing director of Hantec Group International Finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like Cheung, he wants Hong Kong to implement a third board with a different set of listing rules to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs a new board with different regulations from the main board and the GEM to meet the needs of technology companies," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ricky Chim Kim Lun</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chim, 47, is a veteran of the financial industry of two decades, and a director of several listed companies. His seat was formerly held by his father Chim Pui-chung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should follow US regulations to attract a wide range of companies to list here, not just IT firms, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want companies in all industries and all sizes to list here to make it a diversified market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chim is also opposed to letting the SFC decide on what companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong does not need a new board," Chim said. "Hong Kong should adopt a disclosure based regulatory regime that allows companies to list as long as the disclosed information meets the SFC's standards. If the US can do it, so can Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if public companies offer shares with different voting rights, they should still be allowed to raise funds in Hong Kong, and it's up to investors to decide it they want to accept these unequal rights, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's broking industry is dominated by 14 of the so-called Category A brokers owned by large banks, now with 56.2 per cent share of daily transactions, up from 28 per cent in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle market, comprising 51 Category B brokers, keep a market share of about 33.4 per cent of trading every day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bottom of the market, with 435 small brokers in Category C, now make up 10.4 per cent of turnover, shrinking from 40 per cent market share from their heyday in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smallest brokers have been unfairly treated by the regulator and the government, Chim said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many government policies don't benefit the small players, and may gradually force them out of business," he said. "There should be more policies in place to help the small brokers compete with the big players."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Hong Kong's proposed listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All three candidates object to the listing reforms proposed in June by the HKEX and the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the proposal, two new committees will be established with equal number of representatives from the HKEX and the SFC to set policies for listing companies on the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's too much power in the hands of the SFC, according to all three candidates. The proposal would be of little help to increase the Hong Kong bourse's competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As many as 95 per cent of all the local brokers he'd met are all opposed to the proposed reforms, Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed listing reform would only complicate the listing process and lengthen the time for the approval, " he said. "It would not speed up the process. If the SFC insists on going ahead with the reform, it's going to kill off the market here and add further damage to the low market turnover."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">London's multiple-market structure enables companies ranging from innovative start-ups to mature, established firms to raise funds, according to London Stock Exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined to comment on whether listing reforms in Hong Kong - which might include introducing additional boards with different listing requirements - could help attract more e-commerce and technology companies to list their shares there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he did say that in his experience it was advantageous to offer several different markets catering for a broader range of prospective companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I can only share our experience that shows it would be better to have different markets to meet the different needs of companies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> agrees with the Hong Kong stock exchange principle of "one share, one vote", which prevents companies with a dual-class structure from floating their shares, because it is fair to investors, said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he said he understands why some e-commerce founders might be against it because they want to maintain control of their company despite holding a minority stake. In a dual-share listing, the stocks carry unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> allows firms with this dual-share structure to list on its High Growth Market, which is in between the AIM, the standard market and premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The four markets have different [listing] requirements and can meet the needs of different types of companies," said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is currently consulting the market on listing reforms which propose to set up two separate committees - a listing policy committee to set policies and a listing regulatory committee to approve complicated listing applications. The latest consultation period ends this Friday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Calls for reform came after e-commerce giant Alibaba chose New York over Hong Kong for its US$25 billion IPO two years ago because the former allows dual-share listings. The structure has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s because it is seen as breaching the long-held "one share, one vote" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators refused Alibaba's request for exemption from the rule, which would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate a majority of the board. Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma earlier this month criticised the Hong Kong listing rule, saying it is outdated and cannot match the needs of a modern economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rolet said the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is aware of many start-ups and private companies that want to raise funds but are not yet qualified to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has thus set up a programme called ELITE which allows such companies to undergo 18 months of support and mentorship to prepare them for a listing. Senior executives participate in a number of workshops aimed at helping them review and change their business model.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When they are ready, the companies can try to raise funds through investors or apply to list on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have had 450 companies in 27 countries in Europe, America and Africa [on the programme]," said Rolet. "We are considering bringing it to Asia where there are many high growth companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our youngest participant company in the ELITE programme is just seven months old, and the oldest one is a 700-year old wine making company. Some are start-ups while some of them are family-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no guarantee that these companies will succeed and some of them may collapse. But on average, these companies go on to have an annual growth rate of 60 per cent."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s latest proposal to cement founder Jack Ma Yun's control of management after a possible listing in the city might be more acceptable to objectors than a dual shareholding structure. But it is not a perfect solution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior sources at the stock market regulators - the Securities and Futures Commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> - have told White Collar categorically that they would reject any application for a dual share structure to allow Ma and Alibaba's management to keep control of the company after a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a logical position. Allowing it would go against similar requests from </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> in the 1990s and the application last year from English football club Manchester United. Dual share structures, permitted in the US but not Hong Kong, give some shareholders more voting rights than the others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulatory sources said they would not consider a dual-shareholding structure because many investors did not like it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"One share, one vote", is what fund managers and investors say is fair and equal in Hong Kong, as do the regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources at Alibaba say that this line of argument is spurious because the firm is not asking for a dual class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What it wants is to be allowed a partnership structure in which senior management would have the power to nominate a simple majority of the board members and then have shareholders vote on those nominations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba, while Japan's </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> own more than 60 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources at Alibaba and bankers close to it portray this as merely a waiver under an existing provision of listing rule 8.11 which states: "The share capital of a new applicant must not include shares of which the proposed voting power does not bear a reasonable relationship to the equity interest of such shares when fully paid."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It lists two exceptions - one in exceptional circumstances agreed by the exchange, and another when listed companies already have dual shares listed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Alibaba argument goes that if the exemption to the rule wasn't intended to be used, it wouldn't have been created.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some might say that is a little like saying rules are there to be broken - or exempted if they don't suit you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Putting that point to one side, this supposed compromise would still have the net effect of reducing the number of candidates that could be nominated as board directors by the firm's major shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That worries regulators who fear their decision could be blamed in any future dispute between Alibaba management and shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They remain concerned about any proposal that may ultimately amount to giving one group of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators must consider this carefully.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market regulators will not grant any special exemptions to ensure a local share listing for mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has piled pressure on </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx), which has seen share listings fall 28 per cent in the first half of 2013 from a year ago, by threatening to take the potentially US$15 billion deal to New York unless a controversial plan to cement management control in founder Jack Ma Yun's hands is accepted. If we want to introduce a dual shareholders structure, we would need to first do a public consultation, but at the moment we have no plan to do so Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEx</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US listing rules allow a dual share structure that could grant Ma and Alibaba management the control they crave. Hong Kong rules do not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be no exceptions," a top official at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the ultimate approver of share listings in Hong Kong, told the Post on condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source close to Alibaba said the firm neither wanted nor required a dual class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, it is proposing to use existing rules on board-level appointments to allow the firm's senior management to maintain a partnership structure to nominate a majority of board candidates, on whom shareholders would then be allowed to vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The company is not asking the exchange to do anything special for it," said the source, who declined to be identified. "This solution would leave all shareholder rights intact."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The internet giant, which is expected to list its shares before the end of this year, has more than 20 partners including Ma, his co-founders and senior executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, which own more than 60 per cent of the firm's share, are not included in the partnership programme, which was established in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A senior source at HKEx told the Post that the exchange would consider a scheme that did not seek to curtail the voting rights of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"At present, the major shareholders or management always have the right to nominate directors, which will be subject to shareholders' approval. As long as Alibaba could suggest that its nomination process would not affect shareholder protections, HKEx would consider it," the HKEx source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under Hong Kong's regulation, the SFC has the right to reject any listing applications and a source with the regulator told the Post that there would be no exemptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, the chief executive of HKEx, said after the results announcement of the exchange last week that the exchange put shareholder protection as its priority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we want to introduce a dual shareholders structure, we would need to first do a public consultation, but at the moment we have no plan to do so," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We would approve any listing application that has shareholder protection as its priority. Other markets may have different ways to do it and we would consider their practices, but at the end of the day, we would not sacrifice shareholder protection."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors have mixed views on the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s consultation exercise for a change in listing rules to accommodate companies with dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> found a wide range of reactions when it conducted a survey of its members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some fund houses oppose changing the rule to allow companies with a dual-share structure to list here as that would allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. They fear this would affect investor protection," association chairman Bruno Lee Kam-wing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, there are others who believe we should consider a rule change to allow technology companies like Alibaba [Group Holding] to list. They believe the current regulations cost us the opportunity to have such a mega company list here and hurt the competitiveness of the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEx consultation, which runs until the end of this month, follows its refusal in October last year to exempt Alibaba from the ban on dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of its board members even though they only hold a minority stake. Alibaba listed in the United States in September in the world's largest flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has banned dual-share structures since 1989, with Swire Pacific the only exception because its two classes of shares were issued before the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">'s head of corporate governance David Smith said he would prefer HKEx to maintain the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is not lagging the world at all as most Asian and Western markets do not allow such structures," Smith said. "The US is the largest market that allows companies with a dual-share structure to list, but it also allows investors to use class actions to sue the companies or directors while Hong Kong does not allow class action."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that if Hong Kong changed its rules to allow dual-share structures, listing hopefuls and their bankers would think of different "creative shareholding" structures to protect the interests of major shareholders or management at the expense of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If many new listings and existing companies shift to a dual-share structure, it would limit the pool of single-share-structure companies for investors," he said. "Investors would prefer investing in a company with a single-class share structure to a company with a dual-class structure. One share, one vote is the best."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith said his fund invested in dual-share-class companies with good management, such as Swire, and there was a variety of models for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two classes of Swire shares carried the same voting rights but had different dividend payment levels, while some dual-share-structure companies had sunset provisions that turned shares with more voting rights into ordinary shares when they were transferred, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We invest in a company for the long term or forever if possible," he said. "As such, we want to make sure we have the voting right to remove poorly performing management or directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If a company lists in a way that ensures the management cannot be removed, we will have to question why it is doing that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shareholders will support any management if it can bring profit and benefit to shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some believe dual-share structures should be allowed as long as the risks are disclosed, Smith said passive fund managers would have no choice but invest according to the weighting of the index. That would mean that if some dual-share firms were added to an index, they would be forced to invest in those companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun Hung Kai Financial executive director Joseph Tong Tang said Hong Kong could consider changing the listing rules as long as additional measures were put in place to safeguard shareholder interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many technology firms have good prospects but their founding members only hold minority stakes," Tong said. "Hong Kong could be more flexible in our rules to attract these companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Securities Association chairman Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak said brokers had reservations about a rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The dual-share structure would create unequal treatment of shareholders," Chan said. "It would be good to have more new listings but we do not want this at the expense of having two classes of shareholders, with some having more say than others."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia Pacific Investment Partners (APIP), the Hong Kong-based real estate developer, is to launch a full initial public offering in London next month, on the SME-dominated alternative investment market (AIM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which invests and develops properties primarily in Mongolia, has applied to list its entire share capital to trade on AIM, which allows smaller firms more flexibility than London's main stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">APIP plans to use the funds raised, on further expansion of its real estate portfolio, including Mongolia's middle-income residential market and providing mortgage loans to individuals and businesses in Mongolia, according to Lee Cashell, its chief executive officer, for which it has a licence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further down the line there could also be expansion into Myanmar and other emerging markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have spent the last 15 years in the Mongolian market," Cashell said. "We believe the group is now well positioned to capitalise on the strong growth opportunities in the Mongolian economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">APIP's revenue rose in the first half of the year to US$1.36 million compared with US$1.02 million in the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has developed around 53,000 square metres of real estate across five developments in the country's capital Ulaanbaatar, and holds eight plots of land on which it believes it can build a further 450,000 square metres.We believe the group is now well positioned to capitalise on the strong growth opportunities in the Mongolian economyLee Cashell, its chief executive officer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its real state assets in Mongolia were estimated to be worth US$312.8 million, according to DTZ </span><span class="s3">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">APIP said it has "strong growth underpinned by current and near-term projects, future planned projects and development and growth of prime land bank at attract cost".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cashell first indicated back in October 2012 he planned to float the company in Hong Kong by early 2014, so the shift in choice could be cause for concern for HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong still leads the world's IPO market, but unlike </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> it operates under the principle of "one share, one vote", which prevents companies with a dual-class structure from floating their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong represented 22 per cent of worldwide listing funds in the first nine months of the year with 40 issuers, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data. London accounted for 3.6 per cent with nine IPO issuers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Who will bell the cat' perhaps sums up the current predicament in Hong Kong capital market circles. In this case the cat in question is approval of new listings and the much asked question is whether it should be the HKEX, or the SFC, or both?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though heated discussions on the subject have been going on for several years, with the latest round of discussions happening last week, there are still no clear guidelines on how the exact modalities are going to be worked out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That said, there did seem a ray of hope last week when the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> decided to usher in listing reforms over the next three months with some drastic proposals like reducing the HKEX's powers in listing matters and making the SFC fully involved in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adoption of these proposals could see HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia losing his place on the committee that approves new listings, while two newly formed committees with equal representation from the SFC and HKEX would handle the listing policy and complicated new listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest proposals, which sound good on paper, has, however, not met with the expected response from market circles, with some experts commenting that the reforms are not enough.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The latest proposals are not that convincing. The HKEX has been a listed company since 2000 and its main objective is to make profits. It should have nothing to do with regulation and instead transfer the powers to SFC,” said Sin Chung Kai, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, which has been urging for the removal of HKEX from regulatory matters as it sees it as conflict of interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing reforms inadequate, say miners[https://www.scmp.com/article/704018/listing-reforms-inadequate-say-miners]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Experts like Sin argue that since the HKEX already collects listing fees, it would be profitable for it to sanction more new listings than was necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Graham, chief regulatory officer of HKEX, however, refutes such charges. He said that the objective of the latest reform, including the removal of HKEX chief from the listing approval panel, is to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kennth Leung, a lawmaker for the accountancy sector, said that the current proposal does not address the conflict of interest issue fully as it still permits the HKEX listing department to conduct the initial approval. In addition, the two new panels also include HKEX members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current proposals give HKEX a lot of influence on approval of new listings and in framing listing policies. The new structure is complicated and a duplication of efforts. It is better to allow the SFC to work with some other market participants to rule on listing issues,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Albert Au, a non-executive director of the SFC and chairman of accounting firm BDO, however, said the current reform is more than enough.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, SFC propose overhaul of stock market listing regime[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1976987/hkex-sfc-propose-overhaul-stock-market-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new proposal allows the SFC to be more involved in new listing approvals and formulation of policies. It is better than the current model, wherein the HKEX may suggest something and the same gets rejected by the SFC,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, the SFC rejected HKEX's draft proposals on dual class structure reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the SFC and the HKEX are involved in policy formulation from an early stage, then there is no need for the former to exercise its veto power. I believe it would help in creating a better working relationship,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the three tier regulatory structure, the government's role was to set the policy while the SFC was to supervise the HKEX as a frontline regulator. Some markets such as Britain, however, have an independent body to approve new listings to prevent conflict of interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Can the proposed listing reform improve the quality of the market?[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1978086/can-proposed-listing-reform-improve-quality-market]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government had after an expert group report in 2003 decided to shift all regulatory powers to the SFC. But it made an immediate about-turn a month later and dropped the plan due to stiff opposition from the HKEX and the business sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lina Lee, head of Asia at Ashurst, a law firm, feels that it would be better to let the HKEX continue as a frontline regulator. “It is better not to opt for drastic changes of the current system as it has worked well in the past,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The removal of the HKEX chief executive from the listing committee is, however, a right step to remove concerns about the conflict of interest issue,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar sentiments are also shared Sally Wong, the chief executive of Hong Kong Investment Funds Association. She said it the reforms are helpful as it enhances the governance structure and gives greater clarity and certainty to the respective roles and responsibilities of the participants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is an important step in addressing a perennial concern about the inherent conflict on the role of the HKEX,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for brokers, also agrees with the current proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We should not allow the SFC to be the sole regulator for listed companies as it may make the SFC more powerful. It would be better to allow the HKEX and other market participants to also monitor listed companies. This would certainly bring more checks and balances,” Cheung said.</span></p>
