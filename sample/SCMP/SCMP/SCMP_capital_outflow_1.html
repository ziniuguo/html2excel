<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Divisions are appearing among top economists, over the likely impact of Brexit on China's macro economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign analysts expect China will allow further deprecation of yuan to offset any export pressure caused by the British breakaway, while mainland-based commentators are tending to argue the currency rate will remain stable, and cash outflow will also be kept under control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists at BofA Merrill Lynch have cut their annual 2016 GDP forecast for China by 0.2 percentage points to 6.4 per cent, largely due to a tightening in domestic financial conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they did add, there could be an indirect drag on China's economic growth from Brexit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As direct trade links between China and the UK are far from strong, the forecast revision is based on potential tightening in financial conditions in China, resulting from capital outflow triggered by yuan depreciation," BofA Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a research report, issued Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their biggest concern was based on the expectation that </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> will have to allow faster depreciation of the yuan against the US dollar in the aftermath of Brexit, to offset building pressure on exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As part of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s (</span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">) easing measures to counter downside growth risks in China, the risks of undershooting in monetary easing remain high in the second half of 2016," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consequently the inadvertent tightening in financial conditions will likely hurt growth in the third and fourth quarters this year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some, including Li Yimin, an macro economy analyst with Shenyin Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, disagree with the assumption that aggressive capital outflows will cause domestic liquidity tightening, forcing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to adopt monetary easing hard to manage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and other financial regulators are becoming more skilled in stemming capital flight, particularly after the lessons they learned from the two intensive capital outflows following the yuan's abrupt deprecation, last August and this January," said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An analyst with a Beijing based brokerage, who preferred to remain anonymous, said he felt the authorities are now setting aside reform of the capital account after the Brexit, in favor of focusing on?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">stabilising the currency, balancing the flow of funds, and tightening capital-account control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In this case, there is no need to worry about intensive outflow," he said, "so I do not anticipate any considerable easing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai banking sources told the SCMP on Tuesday that the city's foreign exchange authority had asked banks to strengthen due diligence checks on overseas direct investment, to stem illegal capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> on Monday cut the yuan's fixing to 6.6375 against the US dollar, the lowest level in five and a half years, as the pound dropped to a three-decade low after Britain's stunning decision to break from the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's daily fixing dropped 0.9 per cent from the previous trading day, marked the biggest 24-hour drop since August, when the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> made an abrupt move to devalue the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said the yuan's speed of depreciation still lagged behind that of other Asian currencies, arguing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was likely to accelerate the devaluation to maintain export competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BofA Merrill Lynch analysts said they expected the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to push onshore yuan to 6.8, and above, against the US dollar in coming months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said this would cause another pick up in capital outflow, and the central bank would then have to allow faster domestic expansion to maintain stability in money creation, a similar cycle to what happened last year.With the Brexit risks becoming a reality, we see significant downside pressures on China's growth from trade, capital outflow and financial market channelsNomura analyst note</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then, companies with dollar-denominated liabilities rushed to repatriate their debt, after the drastic depreciation in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This kind of debt repayment became a key driver of capital outflow," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To maintain money creation stability, the central bank had to allow faster domestic expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It wasn't until February or March this year that it regained control of liquidity with the help of foreign exchange controls, and stabilising the dollar exchange rate."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consequently, diminishing capital outflow gave way to a rebound in property and infrastructure investment," it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nomura analysts shared the concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the Brexit risks becoming a reality, we see significant downside pressures on China's growth from trade, capital outflow and financial market channels," they wrote in a note issued on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nomura has now cut China's real GDP growth forecasts by 0.4 percentage points for the second half, leaving the 2016 full-year forecast at between 6.0 per cent and 6.2 per cent growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Daokui, a former external adviser to the International Monetary Fund who now heads a top think tank for the central government, argued the Brexit may well offer more opportunities to China, as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on trade and investment from the country.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A statement from the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) blamed seasonal factors for the larger than expected fall [in foreign reserves], including forex purchases for overseas travel and bond repayments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's capital outflow has moderated a lot and it will move towards a balance in the future,” it said. “The current reserves are adequate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, February 8</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I shall accept that bit about the reserves being adequate but it doesn't really mean much any longer. Adequacy of foreign reserves is an outdated concept from the days of the gold standard when countries worried themselves about how many months of imports they could pay for with their reserves if their export earnings collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The remedy these days is floating exchange rates and foreign borrowings. This is one of those rare instances in which human thinking has actually progressed. To put it in perspective, the United States, with a US$19 trillion economy, has foreign reserves of only US$117 billion while China, with a US$11 trillion economy has reserves of almost US$3 trillion, about 45 times as much relative to economic size and by far the world's largest reserve hoard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/12/a6295ad0-f086-11e6-8960-2c6b8565de23_image_hires.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet it is China that obsesses about the adequacy of foreign reserves. You never hear of it in the US. But what is not true in the SAFE statement, is that China's capital outflow has moderated. The chart sets out the facts. Capital outflow at the end of 2016 was still running at US$653 billion a year, only slightly less than a running figure of US$673 billion at the end of September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is not a moderate amount, nor has it “moderated a lot”. My authority here is SAFE itself, the government agency that calculates China's balance of payments statistics and published the fourth quarter ones earlier this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The difficulty here is that most commentators on capital outflow, including SAFE officials, measure it only as how much the foreign reserves have declined over any given period. That would be US$12.3 billion over one month, US$122 billion over three months and US$232 billion over a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves drop below US$3 trillion for first time in six years[https://www.scmp.com/news/article/2068798/chinas-forex-reserves-drop-below-us3-trillion-first-time-6-years]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is not entirely an accurate measure as it ignores changes in the US dollar value of securities in other currencies but it does indeed represent capital outflow. People fleeing yuan have been given the US dollars they want from the foreign reserves, which are thus depleted. However, there is also another form of capital flight. It arises when exporters understate their true export income to Beijing and then keep the difference abroad. Alternatively they stint themselves on imports of raw materials and component goods, which also allows them to keep export earnings abroad. This is likely to be a good part of what produces a merchandise trade surplus now running at US$547 billion a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are other tricks as well, such as declaring as tourist expenditure what is actually personal capital flight. It is what I think we largely have in SAFE's reference to “larger than expected ... forex purchases for overseas travel.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we shall just do it the technical way. Non-reserve movements in the capital account on the balance of payments plus errors and omissions (which comprise little more than unreported capital movements) showed an outflow of US$187 billion in the fourth quarter last year and US$653 billion for the year overall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's how you calculate a country's capital flows and the calculation continues to show an enormous outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US interest rate rise on Thursday is likely to lead to increased capital outflow from Hong Kong and the mainland, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> increased the official base rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent on Thursday, just hours after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> increased the benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a range between 0.50 per cent and 0.75 per cent - the first rate rise in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the peg link system which means the Hong Kong dollar tracks the US dollar, the city needs to synchronise with any US interest rate movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US interest rates now rising, it's expected that some of the estimated US$130 billion of capital inflow into Hong Kong since 2008 will be exchanged back to the US dollar," said the HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan, during a press conference in Hong Kong today. "A capital outflow from Hong Kong is expected, and the Hong Kong dollar may trade at the weaker end of the peg at HK$7.85 per US dollar."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Link International chief executive Brett McGonegal believes there will be two to three more rate rises next year, which will lead to a strong US dollar against other currencies, including the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The RMB will certainly be under more pressure from the strong dollar, but I'm not sure if we will see much more [movement] than we have seen recently," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Hong Kong overall, he believes the rate rise will be negative, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Money will become expensive, pushing property stocks lower and slowing transactions. I don't like the look of the Hong Kong market over the next year. A tightening Fed is the wrong prescription for the current chill Hong Kong is feeling," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, said the US interest rate rises will mean the greenback will continue to strengthen against the yuan, pushing the Chinese currency to as low as 7.20 yuan/dollar by the end of next year, down 4 per cent from the 6.90 current level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Part of the outflow from China, especially the part that reflects the paying down of dollar debt, may continue," Chandler said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Beijing's recent moves of adding capital controls, however, could help minimise the outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government last month carried out a number of measures to control the outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They included a ban on mainlanders using credit cards to buy Hong Kong insurance products, and from the end of last month </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> also limited bank lending to the equivalent of 30 per cent of an applicant's equity in an overseas firm in yuan.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency has fallen 7 per cent against the US dollar this year, after a drop of 5 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The devaluation has led to a wave of capital outflow by both individuals and companies to buy stocks, insurance policies, and other overseas investment products and assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves fell more than expected in November, by US$69 billion to US$3.052 trillion compared with US$3.121 trillion in October, according to government statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marked the largest monthly decline since January and was similar to the average monthly reduction of US$70.1 billion from August to January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> report estimates that around 70 per cent of the drop was due to the falling value of the yuan against the dollar, following the US presidential election. Excluding valuation effects, foreign reserves still declined by US$21 billion in November, compared with a fall of US$9 billion in October, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, said Beijing is likely to add further controls next year to limit the outflow, and stop the rapid depreciation in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Rather than allowing a significant exchange rate adjustment to deter the potential outflow, the authorities have sought a combination of exchange rate support and additional capital controls," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectiveness."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda, however, said the government measures would not halt the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US dollar expected to strengthen into the year end, the feedback loop will accelerate as the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> continues to burn through reserves to stem the tide.These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectivenessMark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Moreover, I suspect the recent measures to curb loopholes in capital outflow will not turn the tide for depreciating yuan. These capital controls will likely accelerate in 2017," Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Wong, Asia equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, said the interest rate rise would not only lead to capital outflow from China, but also from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the Fed raises interest rates faster than market consensus of two rises in 2017, then there is no doubt Hong Kong could also see pressure with capital outflows," Wong said</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Just look at the 1-month HIBOR [Hong Kong interbank offer] rate, it's gone from 0.36 per cent before the US elections to now 0.62 per cent in a little over a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the unexpected strengthening of the US dollar and acceleration of interest rate rises in the US, capital could start to flow out of Hong Kong and that could have a major impact for its financial sector," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Wong believes the yuan will face pressure, he considers worries surrounding a significant RMB devaluation have probably been overdone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Chinese authorities seem to be pursuing currency and market policies that promote stability. The RMB is now included in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights and given China's economy is still able to maintain over 6 per cent GDP growth, long-term investors in China shouldn't have too much to fear about significant RMB weakness," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmund Yun, head of investment solutions at CIC Investor Services, believes there will be three more rate hikes next year, but that the next won't be until June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although the RMB has continued its weakening trend against the US dollar following the US election, it has in fact appreciated against the euro and the Japanese yen, as recent economic data from China has shown there are some improvement in economic growth," Yun said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Looking forward, we believe the RMB will probably continue to weaken against the US dollar but on a more gradual basis, probably in line with other major currencies such as the euro or yen. We may see RMB to surpass 7.0 to the dollar within 2017," Yun said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US interest rate rise on Thursday is likely to lead to increased capital outflow from Hong Kong and the mainland, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> increased the official base rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent on Thursday, just hours after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> increased the benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a range between 0.50 per cent and 0.75 per cent - the first rate rise in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the peg link system which means the Hong Kong dollar tracks the US dollar, the city needs to synchronise with any US interest rate movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US interest rates now rising, it's expected that some of the estimated US$130 billion of capital inflow into Hong Kong since 2008 will be exchanged back to the US dollar," said the HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan, during a press conference in Hong Kong today. "A capital outflow from Hong Kong is expected, and the Hong Kong dollar may trade at the weaker end of the peg at HK$7.85 per US dollar."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Link International chief executive Brett McGonegal believes there will be two to three more rate rises next year, which will lead to a strong US dollar against other currencies, including the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The RMB will certainly be under more pressure from the strong dollar, but I'm not sure if we will see much more [movement] than we have seen recently," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Hong Kong overall, he believes the rate rise will be negative, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Money will become expensive, pushing property stocks lower and slowing transactions. I don't like the look of the Hong Kong market over the next year. A tightening Fed is the wrong prescription for the current chill Hong Kong is feeling," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, said the US interest rate rises will mean the greenback will continue to strengthen against the yuan, pushing the Chinese currency to as low as 7.20 yuan/dollar by the end of next year, down 4 per cent from the 6.90 current level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Part of the outflow from China, especially the part that reflects the paying down of dollar debt, may continue," Chandler said.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Beijing's recent moves of adding capital controls, however, could help minimise the outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government last month carried out a number of measures to control the outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They included a ban on mainlanders using credit cards to buy Hong Kong insurance products, and from the end of last month </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> also limited bank lending to the equivalent of 30 per cent of an applicant's equity in an overseas firm in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency has fallen 7 per cent against the US dollar this year, after a drop of 5 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The devaluation has led to a wave of capital outflow by both individuals and companies to buy stocks, insurance policies, and other overseas investment products and assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves fell more than expected in November, by US$69 billion to US$3.052 trillion compared with US$3.121 trillion in October, according to government statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marked the largest monthly decline since January and was similar to the average monthly reduction of US$70.1 billion from August to January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> report estimates that around 70 per cent of the drop was due to the falling value of the yuan against the dollar, following the US presidential election. Excluding valuation effects, foreign reserves still declined by US$21 billion in November, compared with a fall of US$9 billion in October, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, said Beijing is likely to add further controls next year to limit the outflow, and stop the rapid depreciation in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Rather than allowing a significant exchange rate adjustment to deter the potential outflow, the authorities have sought a combination of exchange rate support and additional capital controls," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectiveness."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda, however, said the government measures would not halt the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US dollar expected to strengthen into the year end, the feedback loop will accelerate as the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> continues to burn through reserves to stem the tide.These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectivenessMark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Moreover, I suspect the recent measures to curb loopholes in capital outflow will not turn the tide for depreciating yuan. These capital controls will likely accelerate in 2017," Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Wong, Asia equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, said the interest rate rise would not only lead to capital outflow from China, but also from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the Fed raises interest rates faster than market consensus of two rises in 2017, then there is no doubt Hong Kong could also see pressure with capital outflows," Wong said</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Just look at the 1-month HIBOR [Hong Kong interbank offer] rate, it's gone from 0.36 per cent before the US elections to now 0.62 per cent in a little over a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the unexpected strengthening of the US dollar and acceleration of interest rate rises in the US, capital could start to flow out of Hong Kong and that could have a major impact for its financial sector," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Wong believes the yuan will face pressure, he considers worries surrounding a significant RMB devaluation have probably been overdone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Chinese authorities seem to be pursuing currency and market policies that promote stability. The RMB is now included in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights and given China's economy is still able to maintain over 6 per cent GDP growth, long-term investors in China shouldn't have too much to fear about significant RMB weakness," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmund Yun, head of investment solutions at CIC Investor Services, believes there will be three more rate hikes next year, but that the next won't be until June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although the RMB has continued its weakening trend against the US dollar following the US election, it has in fact appreciated against the euro and the Japanese yen, as recent economic data from China has shown there are some improvement in economic growth," Yun said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Looking forward, we believe the RMB will probably continue to weaken against the US dollar but on a more gradual basis, probably in line with other major currencies such as the euro or yen. We may see RMB to surpass 7.0 to the dollar within 2017," Yun said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) from Hong Kong companies reached record levels in the first quarter, as firms poured US$15.5 billion into overseas market - the highest total since 2001, Mergemarket data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas M&amp;A activity by mainland companies cooled drastically, however, as government capital outflow controls tightened since the second half of 2016, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies made 80 outbound M&amp;A deals worth US$12.5 billion in the first quarter, compared with US$82 billion during same period last year, while deal count also dropped from 96.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As an offshore financial centre with less influence from the capital outflow controls imposed by Chinese regulators, Hong Kong continues to have robust outbound appetite," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That US$15.5 billion spent by Hong Kong firms involved 23 deals, beating any previous quarters measured by Mergermarket by at least US$ 5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Topping the deals was a US$9.8 billion bid made by a consortium led by </span><span class="s3">Cheung Kong Property</span><span class="s1"> to take over Australia power provider </span><span class="s3">Duet Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That was followed by </span><span class="s3">Chow Tai Fook Enterprises</span><span class="s1">' US$3.1 billion deal to acquire Australian utilities giant </span><span class="s3">Alinta Energy</span><span class="s1">. The two accounted for 83.2 per cent of total outbound value in the first quarter, with a combined US$12.9 billion investment into Australian assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese regulators have been tightening outbound M&amp;A approvals and capital outflow, as the yuan continued to depreciate, since the second half of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In terms of deal nature, those below US$ 5 billion in value would stand a higher chance of getting approved [in China]. Sectors on the watch list of regulators range from real estate to leisure, such as property, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and sports clubs," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest outbound deal from China so far this year was </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">'s US$1.5 billion acquisition of US-based MoneyGram.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was a fraction of the size of largest deals in the first quarters of the last two years, led by ChemChina in their US$ 45.9 billion </span><span class="s3">Syngenta</span><span class="s1"> deal in Q1 2016, and US$ 8.8 billion Pirelli deal in Q1 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inbound interest by companies from outside of China and Hong Kong in the region has also slowed to the lowest level in in a decade by number of deals, the report shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just 23 deals worth a US$ 3.2 billion were made in the first three months, making it the worst performing quarter since the first quarter in 2004, when only 18 inbound deals totaling US$ 2.2 billion were recorded, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Despite China's open policy for foreign investment, capital outflow controls imposed by the regulators has also affected overseas investor appetite, especially when returning profits from China to overseas shareholders has becomes such a concern," the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new cap ordered by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on the outflow of yuan will not affect the two Stock Connect share trading schemes, that link the Hong Kong stock market with their equivalents in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), or stockbrokers, according to officials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With just days before the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect on Monday, the central bank issued orders to cap the amounts companies can invest overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies cannot now invest more than 30 per cent of their equities stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said they viewed the move as the government's latest effort to prevent capital outflow from the mainland, as many companies and individuals continued investing into overseas assets to escape the devaluation of the yuan, which has fallen 7 per cent this year against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no fund outflow in the Stock Connect mechanism because fund flow is insulated within a closed loop,” said a spokesman for HKEX.Funds from the sale of shares cannot be used in the market where the shares are listed. This ensures the programme is used exclusively for the purposes of investment activities between the two markets and cannot be used for other purposesHKEX spokesman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Once Hong Kong and international investors sell their A-shares or mainland investors sell Hong Kong shares, money flows back into their home market accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Funds from the sale of shares cannot be used in the market where the shares are listed. This ensures the programme is used exclusively for the purposes of investment activities between the two markets and cannot be used for other purposes,” the HKEX spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which goes live on Monday, is expected to be popular with mainlanders wanting to invest in Hong Kong stocks, especially as the yuan continues to fall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scheme allows international investors to buy into 881 Shenzhen stocks at up to 13 billion yuan a day while mainlanders can invest 417 Hong Kong stocks up to 10.5 billion a day. The daily quota is the same as the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock connect, launched in November 2014.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benny Mau, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, said investment made via the stock connect cannot be taken out the stock markets for other types of investment, so capital outflow is not affected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When mainlanders buy Hong Kong stocks and earn a profit, they can sell their stocks. But then, profits must be returned to their mainland securities accounts while they cannot take the money out to buy properties or other investment in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, investment made via the stock connect will not led to capital outflow,” Mau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s new orders mainly affect cross-border acquisitions, but not Stock Connect investments,” Mau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said even if the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> planned a cap on individual investors, it would be difficult to enforce.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Stock Connect schemes are mainly aimed at individual investors. It would be hard to add a cap on their investment, as the central bank would find it hard to check on each individual's wealth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new orders will not affect trading using Stock Connect. There will still be a lot of mainland investors buying Hong Kong stocks,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has recently expanded its Primary Liquidity Providers scheme, by renewing the terms of the seven banks involved, and adding two more banks with additional bilateral swap lines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is to ensure that the banking system in Hong Kong has the necessary backstop for the purposes of assisting banks in managing their RMB liquidity following the launch of the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Connect,” an HKMA spokesman told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is attractive as a centre for Chinese companies going out in many ways, including its status as a premier offshore RMB hub, simple and competitive tax regime, close proximity to mainland China, full integration with the rest of the world, extensive banking network, first class financial market, professional servicesm” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many Chinese enterprises have already established a business presence in Hong Kong. As they extend their global reach, Hong Kong remains a competitive and attractive platform for them to do so.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Making yuan a global currency can wait. For now Beijing has prioritised stabilising the yuan over everything else, tightening controls over capital outflow to curb speculation that triggered sharp devaluation of the currency this month. But it has not closed the door to the global dream and investors just need to adapt to its new pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As capital outflow pressure piles up with the decoupling of monetary policies between China and the US, and expectation for a weaker yuan grows as economic growth slows to the lowest pace in 25 years, China is struggling to rebalance its pace of opening up its capital account, an irreversible commitment it has signed on to by joining the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s elite list of currencies in November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is obviously not moving to a new regime in which suddenly everything becomes market-based. It's not surprising that the government is managing the process. Managing the process means opening the door for a little while, and closing it, and opening again," said Markus Schomer, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">PineBridge Investments.READ</span><span class="s1"> MORE: Offshore yuan interest rate rockets to 200 per cent, with the People's Bank eager to punish speculators</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to KH Heng, senior forex strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking, "It looks like the immediate priority of the Chinese authorities is to stem excessive capital outflow and one-sided speculative bets for yuan depreciation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But I believe that over the long term, over a multi-year horizon, the objective is still internationalisation of the RMB. This is in line with recent efforts for more foreign central banks to trade in onshore foreign exchange market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Doubts have been cast on China's grand plan opening up its capital account after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">unexpectedly pushed up the funding rates on the offshore yuan markets on January 12 and imposed the reserve ratio on foreign banks a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before that, the turmoil on China's yuan market had battered offshore yuan - mainly traded on the free market in Hong Kong - to a five-year low as it plunged to 6.6964 against the US dollar on January 6.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> data show commercial banks sold a net 629 billion yuan (US$95.61 billion) worth of foreign exchange in December, or nearly triple the amount the previous month, as capital outflows grew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, as the central bank continues to fight off speculators, China's foreign exchange reserves are bleeding. Reserves contracted by US$ 513 billion last year to US$3.33 trillion from a peak of US$3.99 trillion in June 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> approved the inclusion of the yuan as the fifth member of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket in November, which is set to take effect this October. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had declared it would reduce intervention in the exchange rate and accelerate the full convertibility of the yuan after the decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Wenjie, a strategist at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">, said it seemed the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is dealing with a new situation since joining the SDR and would step up management of the capital accounts "for a while", but is unlikely to pull back too much. For instance, it is unlikely to scrap the annual quota of US$50,000 for individual Chinese nationals buying foreign currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is trying to figure out what the bottom line of the central bank is. It could be the size of capital outflow or the stability of the exchange rate, or the independence of the exchange rate policies. But obviously, they cannot hold all of the three lines," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opening of the capital markets essentially involves the reallocation of China's investment capital, which will cause net capital outflow and further weaken the yuan, said Schomer at PineBridge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But China did choose a good time to make the move, because it would be much more complicated and damaging if they opened the door when the currency was undervalued...the minute you open the door the currency begins strengthening, and China will have to curb currency appreciation that would strangle exports."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other analysts also broadly argue it would be much more painful and the outflow would be much more aggressive if hot money flooded in when the currency was undervalued. China has avoided that situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Right now, the biggest problem is the fear triggered by yuan's valuation falling too much, which drives volatilities. But this is much easier for China to manage," Schomer said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But one thing that really is in great need for improvement is communication. Investors have been second-guessing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> as the latter has stayed mum and unreachable for almost two weeks amid the sharp devaluation of the yuan since January until it suddenly launched a shock-and-awe attack on yuan short-sellers on January 12.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No senior officials have made any comment or taken questions from media until January 15, when Premier Li Keqiang made an official statement, saying "China has the ability to continue to maintain the yuan exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced standard".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2014, when the Chinese yuan started depreciating, China has lost more than US$800 billion in its foreign reserves, some of which was used to stabilise the yuan's exchange rate as it aims at becoming a global reserve currency. This year, the yuan has faced strong depreciation pressure as the US economy rebounds and a rate rise at the end of this year seems almost certain. Strong depreciation expectation on the yuan has provoked capital outflow, leading Beijing to tighten outbound direct investment and the amount of yuan that Chinese companies can remit overseas.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The head of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has vowed to defend the 32-year-old Hong Kong dollar peg even though it is facing up to US$130 billion of capital outflows due to last month's US interest rate rise and the weak local economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have no plan, no intention, and have no need to change the peg link system which has served Hong Kong financial markets well over the past three decades," HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said on the sidelines of the Asian Financial Forum meeting in Hong Kong on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The HKMA is capable and is determined to keep the peg going on as the ... system keeps the Hong Kong dollar stable, which is the cornerstone of our economy."BLOG: China Markets Live - Shanghai stocks reverse higher at noon break; Hong Kong remains lower</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar fell to 7.80 against the US dollar at one stage on Monday morning, the weakest in four years, after falling by 0.36 per cent against the greenback last week - the most in 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the fall was due to capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is natural to see the capital outflow from Hong Kong after the US increased its interest rate in December," he said. "It is also because the Hong Kong economy is weak and the stock market has fallen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The HKMA has the ability and sufficient reserves to defend the peg even if some of the US$130 billion capital which has flowed into the Hong Kong markets in recent years leaves. When this money flows out, the Hong Kong dollar would fall and the interest rate would rise. But the process would be gradual and would not be too fast."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said HKMA would sell the US dollar and buy the Hong Kong dollar whenever it fell to the weak end of the peg link at 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar has been weakening since last week when it fell 0.36 per cent against the US dollar, its worst weekly fall in 12 years, due to capital outflow as investors take money out of the city following the rise in US interest rates last month. The stock market slump in Hong Kong and on the mainland since the start of this year has also led investors withdraw money from the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local currency was trading at 7.7968 at 4:30pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it has not yet reached the level that would require the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to intervene. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar at 7.80, and the HKMA will intervene whenever the currency trades beyond strong end of 7.75 or weak end at 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority spent HK$227.15 billion to weaken the Hong Kong dollar in defence of the peg last year. It is likely to continue the intervention this year, but for a different reason - to prevent it from being too weak. The last time the HKMA had to use its HK$3.27 trillion Exchange Fund to rescue the Hong Kong dollar from being too weak was in 2005.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors are overall very gloomy about the Asian markets as a whole including Hong Kong and China. There's obviously a lot of capital outflow. We are going to see the Hong Kong dollar fall further," said Joseph Tong Tang, executive director of brokerage firm SHK &amp; Co.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves dropped more than expected in August, hitting the lowest level since December 2011, indicating that capital outflow pressures remain a concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forex reserves stood at US$3.185 trillion at the end of last month, down US$15.89 billion from the end of July, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Wednesday. The market consensus was for a US$11 billion decline. The reserves fell US$4.1 billion in July.The data showed capital outflow pressure remained on expectation of further yuan depreciationLiu Jian, senior researcher, Bank of Communications</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The data showed capital outflow pressure remained on expectation of further yuan depreciation," said Liu Jian, a senior researcher at the Bank of Communications. "A faster depreciation of the yuan in late August may quicken the outflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said pressure on outflows would remain for the rest of the year as a gradual depreciation of the yuan was widely expected, although the pressure was smaller than what was seen last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China unexpectedly devalued the yuan by 2 per cent in August last year, triggering a flood of capital outflows over fears of a sharp further depreciation. The reserves fell by US$513 billion last year. China has already introduced tighter controls on capital outflows to put a brake on the drop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested continued intervention by the central bank and outflows remained sizeable. "The key takeaway is that although concerns about China are no longer front-page news, capital outflow pressures haven't gone away," he wrote in a note.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government is embarking on a massive policy shift designed to stem capital outflow by curbing mainland China's outbound investment, sources informed of official instructions have told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tighter control of outbound investment is likely to put an end to a trophy asset shopping spree by well-connected companies such as Anbang Insurance and Dalian Wanda, with Beijing ready to cut the supply of foreign exchange for such deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai's municipal foreign exchange authority had told bank managers in the city that all overseas payments under the capital account bigger than US$5 million would have to be submitted to Beijing for special clearance before proceeding, the sources said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the move did not necessarily mean all such deals would be vetoed, the regulatory procedures that would have to be navigated before completing them would take much longer, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A separate document seen by the Post, said to be the minutes of a central bank meeting on cross-border capital controls, said that by September next year Beijing would ban deals involving investment of more than US$10 billion, mergers and acquisitions valued at more than US$1 billion outside a Chinese investor's core business, and foreign real estate deals by state-owned enterprises involving more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank did not reply to faxed questions about the document and the central government has not made any public statements about a policy change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it has been sending more obscure signals. On Monday morning, a two-line statement signed by the four ministerial bodies supervising mainland China's overseas investment was published by the official </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> news agency and also posted on the central government's portal website. The </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1">, the Ministry of Commerce, the People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said the mainland would not change its regulatory framework for outbound investment, but the central government would "check and verify outbound investment projects by some companies according to relevant laws and regulations".?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said that as the mainland's yuan currency continued to weaken against the US dollar and its foreign exchange reserves shrank further, the authorities were expected to become increasingly hostile to overseas deals by mainland companies and to impose more regulatory scrutiny and foreign exchange checks on mainland investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eric Liu, a partner at law firm Linklaters in Beijing, said he was not surprised the authorities were closing doors for outbound investment focused on asset diversification due to growing capital outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's already visible that tighter scrutiny would make it more difficult for capital to sneak around current measures and thus slow down outbound investment in the short term," Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by US$873 billion since hitting an all-time high of US$3.99 trillion in June 2014.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government is embarking on a massive policy shift designed to stem capital outflow by curbing mainland China's outbound investment, sources informed of official instructions have told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tighter control of outbound investment is likely to put an end to a trophy asset shopping spree by well-connected companies such as Anbang Insurance and Dalian Wanda, with Beijing ready to cut the supply of foreign exchange for such deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai's municipal foreign exchange authority had told bank managers in the city that all overseas payments under the capital account bigger than US$5 million would have to be submitted to Beijing for special clearance before proceeding, the sources said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the move did not necessarily mean all such deals would be vetoed, the regulatory procedures that would have to be navigated before completing them would take much longer, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A separate document seen by the Post, said to be the minutes of a central bank meeting on cross-border capital controls, said that by September next year Beijing would ban deals involving investment of more than US$10 billion, mergers and acquisitions valued at more than US$1 billion outside a Chinese investor's core business, and foreign real estate deals by state-owned enterprises involving more than US$1 billion.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank did not reply to faxed questions about the document and the central government has not made any public statements about a policy change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it has been sending more obscure signals. On Monday morning, a two-line statement signed by the four ministerial bodies supervising mainland China's overseas investment was published by the official </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> news agency and also posted on the central government's portal website. The </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1">, the Ministry of Commerce, the People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said the mainland would not change its regulatory framework for outbound investment, but the central government would "check and verify outbound investment projects by some companies according to relevant laws and regulations".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said that as the mainland's yuan currency continued to weaken against the US dollar and its foreign exchange reserves shrank further, the authorities were expected to become increasingly hostile to overseas deals by mainland companies and to impose more regulatory scrutiny and foreign exchange checks on mainland investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eric Liu, a partner at law firm Linklaters in Beijing, said he was not surprised the authorities were closing doors for outbound investment focused on asset diversification due to growing capital outflow pressure.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's already visible that tighter scrutiny would make it more difficult for capital to sneak around current measures and thus slow down outbound investment in the short term," Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by US$873 billion since hitting an all-time high of US$3.99 trillion in June 2014.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange regulator has pledged to up the ante in its clampdown of what it calls “fake” overseas investments, after some individuals and companies were found to be using false deals to move assets out of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But officials insist capital outflow levels are easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo Song, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) director-general of Capital Account Management, said on Thursday that in the past year it had found cases of assets being moved overseas, which were falsely claimed as being for mergers or acquisitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aggressive outbound deals by wealthy Chinese have been encouraged by the government, as part of its “going global” economic initiatives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts say that in some cases, aggressive outbound deals pushed by deep-pocketed Chinese buyers, have proved little more than ways of moving their money outside of the country, amid an economic slowdown and a weakening yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's outbound direct investment spiked at US$102.75 billion (HK$796.92 billion) in the first seven months, a 61.8 per cent year-on-year surge. Foreign direct investment into the country rose just 4.3 per cent year on year to $77.13 billion in the same period, official data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo said no large amounts of capital outflow via fake investment deals has been detected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We support genuine outbound investment that follows the rules, but we will maintain a strict crack down on fake methods...it is a key concern,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for the latest wave of US-listed Chinese companies seeking listed status in the mainland, Guo said SAFE would support their currency exchange demands to delist from the US market, but “will avoid companies with arbitrage intentions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 30 US-listed Chinese companies are pushing for privatisation in the US and eyeing a relisting in the domestic A-share market.We support genuine outbound investment that follows the rules, but we will maintain a strict crack down on fake methods...it is a key concernGuo Song, spokesman, </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A key motivator behind the wave is the higher valuations of listed companies in China. But the privatisations often require large amounts of currency to be exchanged denominated in US dollars, which could further drain China's declining foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo said SAFE would support “normal outbound merger and acquisition deals, but would also maintain the balance of income and expense”, and noted the pressures on capital outflow was easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves dropped to their lowest since January 2012 in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar value of the reserves decreased by US$15.9 billion to US$3.19 trillion in August, following a small decline of US$4.1 billion in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said China's capital outflows had two primary drivers - the unwinding of carry positions and the purchase of foreign assets by Chinese residents and companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Iris Pang, an analyst with </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1">, said strong motivation still exists, particularly for the second type.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People and companies in China have a strong desire to allocate part of their wealth to overseas markets, as domestic investment returns decline and the property market becomes increasingly frothy and risky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The outlook of the yuan has dampened as the US heads for possible interest rate hikes by the end of this year, and suggests more hawkish moves next year,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Larry Hu and Jerry Peng, analysts with Macquarie, said capital controls “are more effective” against the second type of capital flight, which is largely domestic money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For carry trade unwinding or hot money flows, it's much harder to control as it's all foreign money,” they said in a research note issued Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, they said hot money is not unlimited, estimating 60 per cent of the US$742 billion carry trade inflows from the first quarter in 2009 to mid-2014 had already left.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, the pressure on capital outflow has eased lately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some domestic residents still have the motivation to move money overseas, but that's much easier for the regulator to control.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange regulator will make it more difficult for property developers operating in the US to rely on a controversial investor visa programme to fund their projects, a Chinese industry association said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Restrictions aimed at controlling how Chinese companies and individuals deploy capital overseas will make it difficult for them to invest in businesses not aligned with domestic consumer demand, such as pharmaceuticals, and prioritise industries for the government including advanced manufacturing, Xu Chen, Chairman of the US chapter of the </span><span class="s3">China General Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> (CGCC), told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"From July, [</span><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, or SAFE] will continue to further tighten capital outflow from China and this is very important to the EB-5 program," Xu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's reasonable for China to tighten restrictions on the capital outflow into [the real estate] market" because Chinese investment in this sector had surged too quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the meantime, China's central government, central bank and also the foreign exchange control authorities are encouraging the capital outflow in the market closely related to the consumption demand in China's market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sometimes referred to as the "golden visa programme", the HB-5 programme allows foreigners investing as little as US$500,000 in a qualifying real estate projects to apply for permanent residency. Qualification for projects approved for the $500,000 minimum investment level is limited to those in areas of high unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cases of fraud in EB-5 projects and questions over how some projects in high-rent areas received their qualifications prompted US senators, including California's Dianne Feinstein and Iowa's Chuck Grassley, to call for the elimination of the programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kushner family borrowing US$250 million to repay Chinese investors of EB-5 visas[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2097034/kushner-family-borrowing-us250-million-repay-chinese-investors-eb]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">News that a property developer owned by the family of US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has raised funds for a high-rise project near Manhattan through the EB-5 programme increased public scrutiny. That attention peaked when Kushner's sister touted her family's ties to Trump to attract more investors during presentations in China last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors from mainland China have accounted for more than three quarters of the EB-5 visas issued in recent years, particularly since the financial crisis of 2008, when more traditional forms of credit for real estate projects dried up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CGCC's Xu said banks in Hong Kong and Macau will step up supervision of funds remitted to the US to ensure they don't violate SAFE's policies. Moreover, he said, the Trump administration's focus on restricting immigration may further restrict the ability of banks and other intermediaries involved in pooling EB-5 investments for property developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu's comments about China's control over investment outflows highlighted insights from a CGCC survey of its US membership, particularly the degree to which this is affecting their investment plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The recent tightening of outbound investment oversight by the Chinese government has affected 54 per cent of the surveyed companies' investment plans," according to the CGCC's just-published report of survey results. "Among these affected companies, 80 per cent say the change has increased the time for getting approvals, and 78 per cent say it has made it more difficult to obtain approvals."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital outflow controls appear to be a more pressing issue for the CGCC's US chapter members than restrictions they face in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sixty-five per cent of the survey's respondents "consider the implementation of US policies and rules to be unbiased", the survey report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts warn of hot money outflows from Hong Kong that could negatively affect the equity and property markets if the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> initiates its first rate-tightening cycle in nearly nine years this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the US adopted it aggressive monetary easing policy in 2008, about US$110 billion worth of funds has flowed into the local equity and property markets, according to the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those funds, however, could head for the exit if US interest rates begin to ratchet higher on a path towards policy normalisation, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norman Chan Tak-lam, chief executive of the HKMA cautioned in September that higher US rates "may lead to some capital outflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher rates would bring about an end to the low interest rate environment, a mirror image of the conditions that brought waves of capital to Hong Kong shores in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joe Tong Tang, executive director of </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1">, said the outflow of hot money started over the last few months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market has expected that the US would increase the interest rate in the second half of this year, while the mainland economy and stock markets were not performing well. This has led investors to withdraw from the market, which explains why the stock market turnover is so low recently," Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock market turnover on Thursday stood at only HK$69.50 billion, compared with an average daily turnover of HK$109.9 billion in the first 11 months this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for financial services sector who is a broker, shared the view.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock market sentiment is so weak recently as investors are worried the interest rate rise will led to capital outflow. This will continue for some time as the US is likely to continue to increase the interest rate next year," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong Man-bun, an executive director and head of research in </span><span class="s3">KGI Asia</span><span class="s1">, agreed that there will likely be additional capital outflows in coming quarters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the US increases the interest rate frequently next year, money invested in Asia in the past few years would likely flow back to the US markets," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Gary Cheung Wai-kwok, the chief executive of Tung Shing Futures, said the market has already discounted the US rate rise and as a result, he believes the market may bounce back even if the Fed tightens as many analysts expect. "The market sentiment may improve after the rate rise as it clears up uncertainty," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US interest rates have been frozen since 2006, reflecting the longest pause in its modern history. In an another low-interest rate period during the 1990s, the Fed held the target rate at 3 per cent for 17 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analyst expects the interest rate will increase by 25 basis points this week, while tightening could take place in larger moves more next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Bank executive director Andrew Fung said the rate rise is likely to be more gentle than in previous cycles and he thus believes outflows will also be softer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, the capital outflow can be triggered by other factors too, such as relatively weaker share market," Fung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Reorient Group, said the local property market will get hit by the rate rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong real estate market will get hit as the dollar peg and tightening will move up mortgage rates and make property less attractive," McGonegal said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the offshore yuan also rose, as the dollar traded at 6.8801 yuan compared with 6.8845 in the prior session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier in the day, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan's mid-point rate at 6.8823 per US dollar, down 31 basis points from the previous day. It marked a second day for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to weaken the fixing rate.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese banks sold a net 48.3 billion yuan (US$7 billion) in spot foreign exchange settlements in March, the lowest level since mid-August, according to recent government statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Following the stabilisation of foreign exchange (FX) reserves and RMB exchange rate, the decline in net FX settlement deficit was not surprising, but confirmed easing capital outflow pressure," said Ken Cheung Kin Tai, Asian forex strategist at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If China started to relax its capital outflow controls, we look for further cross-border RMB flows to offshore market, which were being suppressed since the fourth quarter 2016."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose for the 12th consecutive month on the back of a weakening dollar and tough capital controls, according to official data released on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves grew US$21.5 billion in January to hit US$3.16 trillion, the highest since October 2016, </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> figures showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The monthly growth in January, which was bigger than an increase of US$20.2 billion in December, came amid China's strict capital account controls and a strengthening yuan, which is at its highest level against the US dollar since August 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China does not face much pressure from capital outflow for now,” said Hong Hao , chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bocom International Holdings</span><span class="s1"> . “Pretty much all the loopholes in the capital control scheme have been plugged.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex new year resolution: hit illegal currency outflows hard in 2018 [http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2132140/chinas-forex-new-year-resolution-hit-illegal-currency-outflows]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has introduced a series of capital control policies in the past two years, including tighter scrutiny of individual purchases of insurance plans abroad and of overseas asset acquisitions by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government was unlikely to relax its grip, Hong said, because the measures were a key reason the foreign exchange reserves had stabilised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is long-term demand driving capital outflow because as China's economy matures, people want to diversify their asset portfolios and buy overseas assets,” said Claire Huang, a China economist at Societe Generale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement that the reserves rose in January thanks to appreciation of non-dollar currencies in the portfolio, and China would see “more balanced” cross-border capital flows in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, the central bank reiterated its determination to “prevent cross-border capital flow risks” and “clamp down harshly on foreign currency crimes”, including underground banks helping Chinese move their money overseas, in a statement following its 2018 working meeting.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing regards capital outflow as a major threat to economic and financial stability after China lost about US$1 trillion in its foreign exchange reserves from mid-2014 to early 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese individuals can purchase US$50,000 worth of foreign currency each year, an annual quota that was renewed on January 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang noted that US dollar-denominated forex reserves may have been inflated by the weakened dollar because it pushed up the US dollar value of euro and yen assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The valuation effect played a large role in the rise of forex reserves this year,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the yuan strengthening more than 5 per cent against the US dollar in the past three months, the government was unlikely to lend support to lift the currency any further, Hong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a delicate balance - neither too much appreciation or depreciation is good for China's economy,” Hong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An even stronger yuan would hurt Chinese exports and raise the costs of its economic structural reform, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forex reserves rose for the whole year in 2017, the first time since 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks tumbled the most in more than two weeks on Friday, after a </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> meeting signalling a gradual rate hike prompted worries about capital flow out of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.4 per cent, or 625.8 points, to 25,601.92, the largest daily loss since October 23. The gauge declined 3.3 per cent for the week - the worst performance in a month.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at between 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent on Thursday, fuelling expectations it would approve the fourth rate hike of this year in December.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is worried that capital will flow out of China, because the expected rate hike is likely to further weaken the Chinese yuan,” said Kingston Lin King-ham, director of securities brokerage AMTD.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow pressures are starting to pile up as China's forex reserves fell for the fourth straight month to hit a 18-month low in October, according to data released on Wednesday, driven by an ongoing trade war.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial stocks led the decline in both mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, after China's financial regulator outlined targets for banks to increase lending to private companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private lending will need to make up at least half of the new corporate loans across banks in three years, Guo Shuqing, chief of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said on Thursday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese capital outflow decreased in the first half of 2016, although deals in the latter part of the year will lift outbound investment to the same levels as last year, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new report from Knight Frank Research says this year has seen "waves of Chinese outbound capital" worth US$10.7 billion (HK$83 billion), a 13.6 per cent drop from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it added the first six months of 2015 provided a high base for comparison, since there were historically large real estate deals such as </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s US$1.95 billion purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese investment was gaining momentum as we crossed the half-year mark," the report said. "Since June there have been deals in the making that promise to turn 2016 into another productive year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China's economy has slowed recently, the country's investors remain interested in global markets, particularly in primary real estate, its analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">High land prices in Chinese cities - for which the government has recently rolled out cooling measures to temper overheating markets - "has encourage capital to seek overseas opportunities," Knight Frank they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite strong outbound investment, analysts warn existing restrictions on China's foreign exchange reserves could cause money to dry up in the overseas subsidiaries of Chinese investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although China's capital outflow control has been a push factor so far, it could be a double-edged sword," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investment in properties abroad has ballooned in recent years, escalating from US$5.6 billion in 2012 to US$34.4 billion last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And tangible assets such as real estate have been more attractive as speculation continues as to when the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will raise interest rates, and as the renminbi has continued to weaken.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"[This] has resulted in a sense of urgency for Chinese investors to invest in USD-denominated assets," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US remains the top destination for Chinese capital, garnering US$5.1 billion in the first half, a 21 per cent increase from the same period last year. In particular, 80 per cent of Chinese investments in the US were in New York, according to </span><span class="s3">Real Capital Analytics</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And most of the capital outflow went into office deals as Chinese institutional capital "continued to chase trophy assets," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Life Insurance</span><span class="s1"> bought the PaineWebber Building in New York for US$1.65 billion and </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> paid US$700 million for an office at One New York Plaza.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The UK also saw a "whopping 75 per cent uptick" in Chinese capital in the first half compared to last year, or US$1.7 billion, particularly from private banks and conglomerates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"London's status as a key international financial centre and the perceived stability of the UK economy definitely contributed to this tremendous growth," the report said.London's status as a key international financial centre and the perceived stability of the UK economy definitely contributed to this tremendous growthKnight Frank Research report</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even following the Brexit vote in June, analysts say interest in London "seems undiminished."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Minsheng Investment Corp</span><span class="s1">, one of the country's largest private investment conglomerates, bought </span><span class="s3">Societe Generale</span><span class="s1">'s London headquarters for US$110 million in September, and </span><span class="s3">China Vanke Co</span><span class="s1"> forked out US$149 million to acquire London's Ryder Court office building.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was also a sizeable market for Chinese funds in the first half, bringing in US$1.68 billion, just 9 per cent less than last year. Increasing connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland markets through stock connects have attracted "new tenant demand," analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As Hong Kong office rents remain the highest in the world, any opportunity to own a trophy Grade A office asset in the central business district cannot be ignored," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additionally, Hong Kong's residential land market offers "better opportunity than some of the hotly contested mainland markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Australia saw a 37 per cent decline in Chinese capital to US$1.7 billion in the first half, although interest remains in office markets in Sydney and Melbourne.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong) </span><span class="s1">expects the city's yuan deposits to keep growing despite capital outflow risks, reaching 1.16 trillion yuan (HK$1.48 trillion) by the end of this year, driven by the prospect of steady appreciation in the currency and increasing overseas investments by mainlanders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yang Ruhai, the general manager and head of yuan business at </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">, the sole clearing bank for yuan business in Hong Kong, said he expected deposits of the currency in Hong Kong would grow by as much as 300 billion yuan this year, compared with 260 billion yuan last year. Even if tapering triggers capital outflow … the yuan will still [appreciate] YANG RUHAI, </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We see the growth maintaining last year's momentum, although we do not see any reason to support faster growth, thanks to the exit of quantitative easing in the US," Yang said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he expected the yuan to appreciate by between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent against the US dollar this year, down from last year's 3 per cent increase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another factor offsetting the negative impact of US tapering would be the rapid growth in yuan outward direct investment, which is expected to see more mainland firms shift their onshore yuan capital to Hong Kong, which has been serving as the platform for mainland enterprises to go abroad, Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing launched a pilot outward direct investment scheme in January 2011, allowing mainland firms to conduct direct investments overseas using yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The volume totalled 80 billion yuan last year, compared with 30 billion yuan in 2012, Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the US Federal Reserve reins in its quantitative easing programme, capital that was invested in developing economies where rates were higher is starting to flow back to developed markets as interest rates begin to rise there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet compared with other emerging market currencies - which have been taking a heavy beating from the strengthening of the US dollar - the yuan could be a bright spot in the emerging currency basket this year, Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the US tapering triggers capital outflow and the US dollar strengthens, the yuan will still be steadily on an appreciation track," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A quarterly drop in China's foreign reserves has not been seen since 1998, when rampant capital outflow occurred in the Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves reached a record US$3.27 trillion in October and then dwindled by US$52.89 billion in November and by US$39.76 billion in December, the first time the figure fell for two consecutive months since the first quarter of 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lack of transparency in China has made it difficult to clearly explain the reasons for the drop, but economists said the increase in rich mainlanders transferring their assets abroad definitely played an important role in the reduction of foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's economy, capitalising on a huge trade surplus and ever-increasing foreign direct investments, has been on a growth fast track over the past two decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thousands of entrepreneurs amassed fortunes as their businesses secured massive overseas orders for everything from shoes and cigarette lighters to leather bags.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, concerns about potential political instability and the sustainability of their businesses prompted many rich people to place part of their money in foreign countries where personal wealth is better protected under democratic systems of government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I've seen an increasing number of entrepreneurs planning to transfer their fortunes abroad because they want to seek a safe haven for their money," said Xiao Zhixing, an associate professor of management at the China Europe International Business School. "Well-educated rich people, in particular, are desperate to do so."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China still has tight controls on cross-border capital flow, although in recent years the government encouraged outbound investments by state-owned institutions and companies as a way of easing inflationary pressure on the domestic economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Privately-owned enterprises or their owners cannot transfer assets abroad and outbound direct investments overseas are subject to strict, lengthy reviews by the authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A typical method used by super-rich mainlanders to bypass these rules is to falsify import deals so they exchange yuan into foreign currencies to buy the "inbound shipments".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The problem doesn't seem very serious now since the government's regulations on fund inflow are still working," said Yi Xianrong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "But the quarterly fall could be a sign that the trend has reversed. China's foreign reserves might start dropping as it is no longer able to achieve a huge trade surplus."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland has long been under pressure to revalue its currency as Western countries accuse it of keeping the yuan artificially cheaper to ensure Chinese-made goods cost less in foreign markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan continued to strengthen last year as the central bank pushed its appreciation through daily fixing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's Commerce Minister Chen Deming said earlier this month the full-year trade surplus in 2011 would narrow 14.5 per cent from a year earlier to US$155.14 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some economists said the capital outflow was also a result of predictions that the yuan had peaked following its constant appreciation since June 2010 when Beijing lifted its de facto peg to the US dollar.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital outflows will continue in the near term even in the light of an increase of foreign exchange reserves in March because both investors and companies want to diversify their assets, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not expect a quick reversal of capital outflows," Standard Chartered analysts Ding Shuang and Yan Se said in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves in March climbed by US$10.26 billion, the first monthly gain since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese households are likely to diversify their investments and increase their foreign asset holdings, Ding and Yan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of 2015, total Chinese outbound real-estate investment had reached nearly US$30 billion, twice that of 2014, as both individuals and institutions invested in Sydney, London and Manhattan to diversify their assets amid the depreciation of the yuan and stock market turbulence, research by property consultant Knight Frank showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A greater contributor of capital outflows is from mainland companies investing in and acquiring western firms. Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group said earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It agreed to buy Dead Sea cosmetics manufacturer </span><span class="s3">Ahava</span><span class="s1"> for US$77 million because it saw increased demand for personal care products in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Chicago Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> agreed in February to be acquired by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, — a deal still pending regulator approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An increasing share of outbound flows is now focused on acquiring assets that provide long-term income, access to new markets and better technologies, rather than just mining and natural resources, a report by HSBC Global Research said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe China's outward direct investment (ODI) will continue to grow despite — or even because of — the domestic economic slowdown as the country looks to diversify its savings into foreign assets," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's non-financial direct investment overseas reached 261.74 billion yuan (HK$312.94 billion) in the first quarter of this year, up 55.4 per cent annually, the Ministry of Commerce said. In March, the newly added investment surged 21.5 per cent year-on-year to 66.4 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly all of China's ODI are settled in yuan, and this particular kind of capital outflow is an important channel for yuan's internationalisation, the </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The depreciation trend of China's "red back", still, is the substantial driver for continuous capital outflow, Michael Every, </span><span class="s3">Rabobank</span><span class="s1">'s head of Financial Markets Research at Asia Pacific, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is a structural outflow that will stay until the onshore yuan finds a realistic level much lower than here, Every said. "Mergers and acquisitions will speed this process up."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, share price drops kicked in across the board, with Sands China dropping 10.13 per cent to HK$33.70 and </span><span class="s3">Galaxy Entertainment Group</span><span class="s1"> slumping 9.69 per cent to HK$37.65. </span><span class="s3">Wynn Macau</span><span class="s1"> declined 9.93 per cent to HK$12.7, and </span><span class="s3">SJM Holdings</span><span class="s1"> fell 5.59 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Casino stocks also dropped in Australia and the United States on news of the new withdrawal limits, a sign of China's widening crackdown on troubling levels of capital outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move to cut the daily withdrawal limit from 10,000 to 5,000 patacas is expected to take effect on Saturday and follows the discovery that as much as 10 billion patacas in </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> ATM withdrawals had been made in one month alone.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move comes amid so far unanswered claims that the customer voucher scheme run by Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore - which apparently allows </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> card users to buy gaming chips in breach of China's strict currency controls - has seen billions of yuan flow out of the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Monetary Authority of Macau's ATM withdrawal cut is understood to be a reaction to attempts by illicit money movers to circumvent Beijing's move at the beginning of this year to cap at 100,000 yuan (HK$112,600) the annual amount that UnionPay cardholders could withdraw.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority has so far not responded to questions from the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Macau finance industry insider told the Post: "What has happened is that individuals are turning up at ATM machines with stacks of cards from individual account holders and are withdrawing 10,000 [patacas] at a time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The authorities have decided it is time to act, and Beijing is backing the move.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two years ago, Beijing put the squeeze on the multi-billion yuan flow of illicit cash through Macau by imposing a crackdown on the use of UnionPay point of service machines, which were being used to disguise overseas transactions as local mainland ones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also cracked down on the practice of pawnshops paying cash for products such as jewellery and watches bought with UnionPay cards to subvert currency controls.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pressure appears to have had a possible knock-on effect in other casino jurisdictions like Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An investigation by the Post has uncovered claims that a voucher scheme operated by Marina Bay Sands casino resort in the Lion City could be an attempt to get around China's currency controls.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau political commentator Sonny Lo said: "At the end of the day, national security is at stake for Beijing when it comes to the integrity of their currency and its outflow in massive amounts. This is what is behind these increasing moves by Beijing to stem capital outflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest actions taken follow a fall in China's foreign exchange reserves in November despite Beijing's attempts to close the door on ­capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The larger-than-expected decline in the world's biggest stockpile of foreign exchange exposed the flaws in Beijing's current ­approach of selling state reserves to support the yuan and was likely to force the authorities to take a stricter line on outbound investment and payments, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves shrank by US$69.1 billion last month to US$3.052 trillion, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Documents obtained earlier by the Post show capital outflow controls are already in force involving forex clearance for outbound investment of more than US$5 million, plus stricter reviews in place over very large deals.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Improvements to China's financial market, such as a market-driven interest rate system, are needed to help the yuan's continued push towards becoming a global currency, senior economists say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin Zhongxia, a former director general of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s Research Institute, who is now China's executive director at the International Monetary Fund, told a forum on Wednesday that bold moves were needed so that the value of the yuan could move more freely.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Beijing's global plans for the yuan suffered a setback last year after market fears caused by a hefty depreciation in the value of the currency, massive capital transfers and a tightening of financial controls by officials to try to control the yuan's value and halt the outflows.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yang, a former deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the forum that last year's exchange-rate turmoil involving the yuan"was rooted in a non-market-based interest-rate system at home".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said China had removed the minimum price level on lending rates and the upper limit on deposit rates, but the authorities had yet to work out unified and broadly accepted interest-rate benchmarks, he said at the forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the measures to manage liquidity conditions were "redistribution instruments rather than market-decided adjustment".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Efforts were needed to introduce market forces, which would reduce distortion and risks involving interest rates and increase a willingness among people abroad to hold yuan assets, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s Executive Board, which represents the fund's 188 member nations, agreed to include the yuan as the fifth currency, along with the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling, making up its Special Drawing Right (SDR) - an international reserve asset that supplements the official reserves of its member countries.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin called for a full assessment of China's current exchange rate policy, at a time when its counterparts in the eurozone and Japan had adopted a policy of negative interest rates to shore up their economies. Such policies had weakened the euro and Japanese yen, which had, therefore, pushed up the strngth of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that in the past China had kept its promise not to devalue the yuan to show its support for the region during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and 1998, but that China had then suffered severe deflation in later years and struggled with pressure for reforms and massive lay-offs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That was connected to exchange rate policy," Jin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, deflation in China's producer price index (PPI) - measuring the average change in selling prices of domestic producers of goods and services - has last 51 consecutive months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Along with the high debt burden, the negative PPI has pushed up the real interest rate for enterprises, which will face more difficulties during the country's efforts at deleveraging.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA) has instructed local banks to submit data of cash withdrawals by UnionPay cards through the city's automated teller machines (ATMs), as the regulator cracks down on unauthorised capital outflow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commercial banks must submit data and documentation regarding the volume and time of the withdrawals by UnionPay cards for the first six months of 2017 to the regulator this week, according to a notice cited by the Apple Daily newspaper. An HKMA spokesperson declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move, following a similar step up in enforcement in May by Macau's monetary authorities, closes a loophole in China's capital remittance regulations, that has thus far focused on the ability by companies to transfer money out of the country, said </span><span class="s3">ING Bank NV</span><span class="s1">'s economist Iris Pang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is obviously to deter capital outflow from individuals that use ATMs,” Pang said in Hong Kong. “This signals that the State Administration of Foreign Exchanges (SAFE) is still wary of capital outflows, even though it has slowed down in terms of banks selling renminbi on their clients' behalf.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's authorities had been stepping up regulations since last year, when a deterioration in the renminbi's value led to widespread capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese individuals are allowed to withdraw up to 100,000 yuan (US$15,737) of renminbi from overseas, and are able to remit up to US$50,000 worth of foreign currency offshore, according to the country's 2016 foreign exchange regulations. Users of UnionPay cards can withdraw up to 10,000 yuan everyday, per card.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To skirt around the foreign exchange controls, some individuals had been using separate ATM cards to make cash withdrawals, prompting the regulators to crack down on the practice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Chinese regulators instructed mainland banks to report on a daily basis any offshore bank card withdrawals, and bank transactions exceeding 1,000 yuan (US$148) starting from August 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Macau government announced in May it would instruct all banks to tighten their compliance measures, known as “Know Your Customer (KYC)” procedures and systems, into all ATMs in the city to deter cash withdrawals that exceeded China's capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, Macau instructed mainland Chinese holders of UnionPay cards to have their identity cards and faces scanned by facial recognition systems before they can withdraw money on ATMs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA “is constantly enhancing the overall level of security of the financial system, including studying the feasibility, stability and cost efficiency of biometric accreditation technology including facial recognition,” an HKMA spokesperson said, adding that the monetary authority did not have plans to instruct ATMs in Hong Kong to be equipped with facial recognition capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The data and materials are easily available to Hong Kong banks,” said Pang. “In terms of feasibility, I do not think it hard for them to shift to a Macau style scrutinising model.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has cut its United States government debt for five consecutive months, taking its Treasury holdings to the lowest level in more than six years and losing its title of the biggest foreign owner of US debt to Japan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect China to continue selling its dollar holdings but a mass sell-off may be unlikely as it is more important for China to keep ample firepower and maintain dollar reserves above the safety line to prevent a potential confidence crisis and safeguard economic stability.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global central banks dumped a record US$403 billion </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> debt in the twelve months to the end of October, according to latest numbers from the </span><span class="s3">US Department of Treasury</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China alone sold US$41.3 billion in October, taking holdings down to US$1.12 trillion as of October, the lowest since July 2010. Japan regained its US debt crown, with US$1.13 trillion of US Treasuries.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan last month depreciated 1.7 per cent against the US dollar, ending the month at 6.8894 per US unit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the same month, China's foreign reserves declined by US$69.1 billion to US$3.05 trillion, the lowest level since March 2011. It was also the biggest reduction in a month since January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of China's foreign reserves are held in US dollar-denominated assets such as US Treasuries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> analysts said in a recent research note: "The sentiment has deteriorated in recent months, especially when it appears that two sensitive thresholds will be breached soon: 7.00 for USD/CNY exchange rate and US$3 trillion for FX reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A re-enforcing mechanism between sentiment deterioration for domestic investors, capital outflow and currency depreciation pressure is the big challenge faced by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> in the very near term, especially if USD strength continues," they said.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its benchmark rate last week and added one rate increase to its outlook for next year, expectations for a stronger dollar have risen further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Innes said: "With the USD expected to strengthen into year end, the feedback looks accelerated, leaving the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> with little option to burn through reserves to stem the tide."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, despite expectations that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would continue reducing US debt holdings, a mass sell-off seemed unlikely, analysts said, as reducing the reserves to below the safety line may cause a potential confidence crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> analysts said US$3 trillion for foreign reserves was a "psychologically important" threshold for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the threshold was breached investors may become more alarmed about China's ability to defend the currency, resulting in huge capital-outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg Intelligence economists Fielding Chen and Tom Orlik said that, according to methodology developed by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> earlier this year, China needs to hold US$2.9 trillion in reserves to provide enough buffer should its capital control measures be ineffective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu Yongding, a former adviser to the PBOC and senior fellow at top government think-tank the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">, said in a public speech in Beijing on Sunday: "The most critical issue for China is to maintain the foreign reserves, not maintaining a steady exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We need keep ample firepower to safeguard the stability of the economy," Yu said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> should stop the intervention of the exchange rate and instead tighten the supervision of cross-border fund flows," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Daokui, a current adviser to the PBOC and professor of economics at China's </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1">, also said publicly over the weekend that a top priority for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> next year was to "strictly control cross-border fund flows" and "resolutely curb the Chinese demand to buy dollars for hedging yuan risks".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhongtai Securities analyst Luo Wenbo said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had sold lots of US debt holdings to prop up the yuan but it didn't stop the currency from depreciating.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also believe it's more important for them to keep abundant reserves than to maintain a stable yuan rate against the US dollar," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tighter controls on capital outflows has cooled the surge in outbound property deals by cash-rich Chinese companies , analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We originally expected this year's outbound real estate investment to show explosive growth, but that did not happen,” Paul Guan, a partner in the real estate practise of global law firm Paul Hastings, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese offshore property investments fell 30 per cent on year to US$3.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with a 35 per cent growth during the whole of 2015, according to data from global property firm JLL.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More Chinese companies are actively seeking to diversify their assets by making investments overseas, especially in the property sector, after the yuan started depreciating in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they face increased hurdles to take money overseas as deals are subject to closer scrutiny by China's foreign exchange regulator which wants to avoid short-term exchange rate fluctuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This did impact investment confidence,” Guan said, adding that regulators are paying more attention to details, such as whether the target property is overpriced and are also monitoring investors' track record in overseas acquisitions.Increased outward remittances could also slow down the processAlbert Lau, chief executive, Savills China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance Group</span><span class="s1"> dropped a plan to take over hotel giant Starwood in late March, for unknown reasons. Foreign media, however, said that the Chinese government has been pressuring insurers to temper their purchases this year in a bid to slow the rapid flow of money to foreign markets. Anbang was one of the most aggressive buyers of overseas firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some property developers have also complained that it has become difficult for firms to move money for overseas deals since late 2015. Every capital outflow of over US$50 million is now subject to approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Albert Lau, chief executive at property consultancy </span><span class="s3">Savills</span><span class="s1"> China, said some of the capital outflow problems are due to the existing bank transfer system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Increased outward remittances could also slow down the process,” he said. Outbound deals in excess of US$10 billion usually needs to be approved by the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC) and the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) before the bank transfer can go through.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That said, Chinese companies' willingness to invest in overseas markets still remains strong this year, despite the slowing economy and an oversupplied property market, said Xiong Jin, an international partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons, which specialises in cross-border mergers and acquisitions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But some deals do fail because of capital outflow controls” he said. Overall, the government is still encouraging overseas investment, but does not want to end up with just capital flight, said Xiong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau's gaming revenues are poised to end a multi-year losing streak this year - but experts still warn the central government's ongoing tightening capital controls could threaten the world's largest gambling hub's pace of recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say the strengthening monetary regulations could deal a blow to the enclave's US$30 billion gambling industry, which is seven times the size of Las Vegas and has started to see some encouraging green shoots of recovery after two years of tumbling revenues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those tougher times have been blamed on President Xi Jinping's sweeping crackdown on excessive spending by state officials, that looks to have scared off high-rolling punters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gambling revenue dropped 3.3 per cent in 2016 to 223.2 billion patacas (HK$216.67 billion), the slowest decline in two years. But thousands of tourists have flocked to two newly-opened casino resorts in the former Portuguese colony in the past three months, according to data from the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau released on Sunday.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe the Macau cycle has turned, and 2017 could show a 10 per cent gross gaming revenue growth - the first in four years,” said </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> gaming analysts including Praveen Choudhary and Alex Poon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dramatic fall in its recent gambling revenue has forced Macau to shift its focus to attract more mass-market guests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the bridge to Hong Kong, a permanent Taipa ferry terminal and a rail link to Zhuhai airport, should make Macau more accessible,” wrote </span><span class="s3">Fitch Ratings</span><span class="s1"> analysts led by Alex Bumbazhny in a December note.We think the risks of more capital outflow control measures should not be ignored and will potentially prevent a robust gaming revenue recovery north of mid-single-digit growth next yearChelsey Tam, Morningstar analyst</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A wave of new resort openings by MGM China and SJM in 2017 are also expected to spur tourist visitor flows, they say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's recent moves to tighten the screws on yuan remittances, however, to stem what have become worrying levels of capital flight and stabilise the country's depreciating currency, have heightened concerns that those could stall the industry's recent growth momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We think the risks of more capital outflow control measures should not be ignored and will potentially prevent a robust gaming revenue recovery north of mid-single-digit growth next year,”said Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Macau monetary chiefs imposed new restrictions on the amount of cash people using mainland-issued China Union Pay bank cards to withdraw cash from ATM machines in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Meaningful depreciation of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar could also trigger more capital outflow control measures,” said Choudhary.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past few years, Macau regulators have launched various crackdowns on underground banks and pawnshops using </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> point-of-sale terminals to illegally spirit cash out of the mainland, in an effort to stem capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau's monthly gambling revenues returned to growth in August, posting their strongest gain in three years in November thanks to the openings of Wynn Macau's Wynn Palace and Sands China's The Parisian projects, that proved instant magnets for mainland holidaymakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising income also helped Macau end a two-year overall economic contraction, lifting its gross domestic product by four per cent in the third quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian currencies fell to their lowest in years on Monday even as the US dollar tumbled on accelerating capital outflow from emerging markets amid rising fears of a hard landing in China's economy dampening growth globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors, instead, flocked to the euro and Japanese yen. The euro hit the strongest level in more than six months, while the yen was at a three-month high against the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia's rupiah fell to its weakest level since the Asian financial crisis 17 years ago, while the Malaysian ringgit also hit another 17-year trough as investors feared that weaker demand from China could hurt demand from its neighbouring countries. The Australian dollar, the Thai baht and the Taiwanese dollar all hit six-year lows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The slump in emerging-market currencies came even after investors pushed back expectations of a rate increase by the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> in September, following the dovish minutes of the Fed deliberations released last week. The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.7 per cent to a two-month low on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In short, China has created a confidence crisis. With the exception of India, Asian economies are suffering from stalling Chinese demand. This places China at the centre of any lift in regional confidence, but we don't believe it is a prelude to another Asian financial crisis," said Min Lan Tan, Apac regional head of the investment office at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> Wealth Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bloodbath in the Asian foreign exchange market has pushed central bankers to prepare intervention to offset market volatility. Economists are also widely expecting Beijing to decrease the reserve requirement ratio for local banks in order to ease a liquidity crunch following capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the recovery in Chinese activity becomes more visible, it should help regional sentiment. However, we think the uplift to commodity prices will remain muted," said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market is awaiting the official purchasing managers' index, a gauge of manufacturing activity, to be released on September 1. Last Friday, the Caixin flash PMI for China disappointed investors at 47.1 compared with expectations of 48.2.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore and offshore yuan stabilised this week after clawing back most of their losses this year but analysts still see volatility ahead despite assurances from the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is steady at about 6.50 to the US dollar in both the onshore and offshore markets this week, the strongest level seen in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rise of the yuan over the past two weeks was mainly because the US dollar turned weaker against other currencies, said Pheona Tsang, head of fixed income for BEA Union Investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The onshore yuan recently strengthened with the weakening of the US dollar against other trading partner currencies, especially the Japanese yen and euro. This is in line with the new onshore yuan basket system where the currency can both appreciate and depreciate against the US dollar," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since the global currency market remains volatile and moves with expectation of different monetary policies of various central banks, volatility remains in the onshore yuan," she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strengthening of the yuan also came after People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan last week vowed the yuan would not devalue sharply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan had the biggest single day jump in a decade to increase 1.17 per cent against the US dollar on Monday. It traded at 6.52 per US dollar on Friday morning. The currency has depreciated against the US dollar by 0.4 per cent this year, down from 1.52 per cent in the first week of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of Friday morning, the offshore yuan is up 0.64 per cent against the US dollar so far this year, reversing a 2 per cent depreciation in the first week of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weaker yuan came about amid China's slowing economy and the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s one-off 2 per cent devaluation of the currency in August last year. The yuan lost over 5 per cent to the US dollar last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some hedge fund managers have said they see the yuan declining as much as 40 per cent over the next three years, while others have forecast a 5 to 10 per cent depreciation this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> research note issued earlier this week stated that the yuan would continue to be volatile during the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While most commentators focused on </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s desire to maintain RMB stability and tame speculators, our key take-away [from PBOC governor Zhou's interview] is that RMB/USD rate may become more volatile, especially if USD dollar starts to strengthen again," the report said.Nothing has changed in terms of risks from China's growth slowdown, FX reserve contraction and persistent capital outflowHeng Koon How, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Also it appears that governor Zhou has ruled out capital controls and any major global coordination on currencies in the foreseeable future. Elsewhere, </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> just opened the inter-bank bond market to retail investors, perhaps to help local governments to sell bonds. In the unlikely event that retail investors rush to invest in bonds, their direct exposure may become another source of financial instability in the long run," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Zhou said China has the ability and a large trade surplus to defend the currency, the </span><span class="s3">Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> report disagreed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe that a lack of profitable opportunities in the domestic market, inflated asset prices, and the risk of financial system instability in China will continue to drive capital out of the country. We suspect that the government may lose its ability to defend RMB within a year or two if the current pace of capital outflow continues," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"From this perspective, a large trade surplus is not necessarily a positive sign as it may mean a stronger desire for domestic capital to leave. This appears to be the case in January as official FX reserves fell by another US$100 billion despite the record trade surplus."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heng Koon How, senior currency strategist at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, remains negative on the outlook of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our view is that nothing has changed in terms of risks from China's growth slowdown, FX reserve contraction and persistent capital outflow," Heng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Wong, client portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments (Hong Kong), said governor Zhou's remarks could bring some stability to the yuan over the next six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is expecting the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to continue to improve its communications over FX policies. With his comments on the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> policy decision and also the fact that he eased concerns over any substantial depreciation of the RMB, Zhou Xiaochuan has momentarily installed some confidence into the RMB," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong also said Beijing would like to see a stable yuan because China is hosting the G20 summit in Hangzhou in September this year, and it has also invited quite a number of non-G20 countries to participate as well. "China certainly doesn't want to have a global forum where a major topic would be on the ongoing concerns of the RMB. We believe China would much rather focus its attention on more meaningful economic topics."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, Hong Kong legislator for the financial services sector, said a stable yuan would benefit the stock market and other investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is a strong relationship between the currency and stock market. When the yuan became stable in this week, the stock markets in Hong Kong and the mainland turned stable. A weak yuan has led to capital outflow which is why China would like to see a stable yuan and stock market. We hope this situation would continue for the longer term," Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Country Garden, China's third-largest property firm by contracted sales in 2016, posted a 39.2 per cent jump in first half net profit to 7.5 billion yuan (US$1.1 billion) year on year, boosted by strong demand and low house inventory in the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The earnings beat the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg by 23 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its contracted sales also soared 131 per cent to 288.9 billion yuan in the first half. Country Garden raised its sales target for this year from 400 billion yuan to 500 billion yuan, a 62 per cent surge from last year's actual sales number 308 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, the company said the number of mainland Chinese investors among buyers of the US$100 billion Forest City in Malaysia were “negligible”, as Beijing tightens its capital outflow controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's regulations on overseas investment and capital outflow didn't affect our business. All our projects have been approved by the government and followed the country's regulations,” said Mo Bin, president and executive director at Country Garden.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the company closed 1.7 per cent higher on Tuesday at HK$9.72, having risen 124 per cent since the beginning of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> retains “equal-weight” on Country Garden.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We think the key to the share price is the sustainability of lower tier cities, where we see the lower tier cities sales recovery is not sustainable,” a </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> research note said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Chinese developer Guangzhou R&amp;F Properties has posted a 22 per cent rise in half year core profit on Tuesday, helped by strong sales in third and fourth tier cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net profit of R&amp;F, which has become the world's biggest owner of five-star hotels after buying 77 Wanda hotels in July, stood at 2.40 billion yuan, 7.9 per cent up from a year ago. Revenue dropped 8.8 per cent to 20.41 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the company rose 9.7 per cent to close at HK$16.28 on Tuesday, and have climbed nearly 74 per cent this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">R&amp;F chairman Li Sze-lim, said the 19.9 billion yuan purchase of Wanda hotels was “cheap”, adding that the acquisition will help the company improve its debt ratio as the price has a big discount to its net asset value of 33 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said he hoped to lift the 77 hotels' “profits attributable to the owner” by 50 per cent in the next three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adrian Chan, assistant to chairman, confirmed to the Post that </span><span class="s3">R&amp;F Properties</span><span class="s1"> and CC Land Holdings have jointly bought the 10-acre plot of land in London's Nine Elms district, replacing Wanda, the previous bidder.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wenzhou, the mainland's hub for private businesses, has taken a major step forward in legalising the underground banking system and liberalising capital outflow by publishing a guideline for a much-awaited financial reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rule aims to transform Wenzhou, plagued by a series of crises related to shadow banking, into the nation's financial services centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March, Beijing endorsed the plan to begin a pilot project in Wenzhou, in a move to legalise shadow banking after dozens of local entrepreneurs committed suicide or fled as underground banks folded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the new rule, Wenzhou will create a registration system for private capital and allow privately owned firms and individuals to participate in the "sunshine private lending" scheme, under which private capital can be lent out to individuals and businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past decade, private lending businesses in Wenzhou's illegal underground banking system helped thousands of local entrepreneurs access the much-needed money to finance their export-oriented manufacturing businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland authorities turned a blind eye to it all as the shadow banks benefited private businesses, which find it difficult to get loans from state-owned banks. But after the 2008 global financial crisis, underground banks were hit by a wave of loan defaults as borrowers, reeling from shrinking orders, began to default.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the new rule, the Wenzhou government will set up intermediary firms that will act as "matchmakers" for borrowers and lenders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yan Yipan, head of law firm Zhejiang Panyuan, said the central and local governments would have to lay down clear-cut guidelines for these intermediaries. "The reform is not a surprise," he said. "But businesspeople will still take a wait-and-see attitude before the officials categorically rule private banking as legal."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under current laws, only financial institutions such as banks can take deposits and lend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rule also states that Wenzhou residents would be encouraged to do "direct investments" abroad under a looser foreign-exchange control, without elaborating how the system will be made looser. Currently, mainland businesses and residents cannot invest in overseas businesses without government approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Underground banks help people illegally transfer funds abroad, with a large proportion going into Hong Kong stocks. The new rule says the "direct investments" do not include buying overseas-listed equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a hedge fund manager said the relaxed control on capital outflow could still lead to misuse of the funds, and money would continue to pour into Hong Kong-listed mainland companies as some of the H shares are cheaper than the mainland's yuan-denominated A shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital outflow finally stopped in September after a 22-month flight - a result that will increase Beijing's confidence in handling turbulence should a hawkish </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raise interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> bought a net 850 million yuan (US$128 million) of foreign exchange in September, marking the first net increase since October 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figures marked victory for Beijing in battling capital exodus partly through enhanced capital account controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In over-the-counter foreign exchange transactions between banks and their clients, companies and individuals sold more to banks in China than they bought from the banks last month, according to data released by </span><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The shift also reflected in an eight-month rise in China's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction by the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> won't fundamentally shake the general stabilisation of China's cross-border flows," the foreign exchange regulator said in a statement, hours after the data were released.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reversal of capital outflows into inflows, along with a strong 6.8 per cent growth rate in the third quarter, help to paint an upbeat picture of the world's second biggest economy as President Xi Jinping hailed what he described as a "new era" of socialism with Chinese characteristics in his speech to the party congress on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jing Ulrich, a managing director at JPMorgan, told a press briefing in Hong Kong on Friday that the general investor perspective on the Chinese economy has "become much more positive compared to the last year or the year before" after the Chinese government managed to keep growth on track.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xie Yaxuan, chief economist with China Merchants Securities, expected no huge rise in foreign exchange purchasing positions because the central bank has reduced intervention in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xie predicted that the yuan would fluctuate with the US dollar in both directions this year, adding that the impact of </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s policy on China's liquidity had eased.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, the head of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange, said on the sidelines of the ongoing Party's Congress on Thursday that China's foreign exchange market had suffered "highly intensive" risks and shocks earlier this year, but currently the overall market situation has stabilised. He also expected the yuan to be become more flexible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan's agency also said in Thursday's statement that capital flows will remain stable and closer links with international financial markets would help facilitate foreign investment in the Chinese capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign investors' confidence in China's capital market has also improved. Their holdings of yuan-denominated bonds has increased over the past seven months, exceeding 1 trillion yuan at the end of September, setting a record high, according to the Shanghai Clearing House.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Tao, chief China economist with </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">, said the yuan remained stable and forecast it would be traded at around 6.6 against the dollar by the end of this year and weaken slightly to 6.7 next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But she expected measures to restrict capital outflows to continue for a while and said the a full liberalisation of capital accounts would not occur in the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s Ulrich told the briefing that China's capital control measures, including those targeting outbound investments in property and luxurious hotels, will remain for "the foreseeable future".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's total funding raised by venture capital-backed financial technology start-ups fell to US$800 million across 26 deals between July and September, a drop of 27 per cent from last year, as the central government kept a tight rein on capital outflows from this sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That amount was down from US$1.1 billion in the same period last year and below the US$1 billion recorded in the quarter to June, according to a recent online briefing by Lindsay Davis, an intelligence analyst at venture capital research firm CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Davis said deal activity of mainland fintech start-ups in the third quarter dropped 19 per cent from 32 transactions recorded in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The downswing marred the sector's strong performance in the three months to September, when mainland transactions dominated the top 10 venture capital-backed fintech deals in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dianrong, the Shanghai-based operator of a popular online lending marketplace, recorded the region's largest fintech deal last quarter - a US$220 million Series D funding round led by China Minsheng Investment, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and South Korean private equity firm Simone Investment Managers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That was followed by the US$200 million Series C financing round of Shenzhen Suishou Technology, which runs a personal finance management platform on the mainland. Its investors included Hong Kong-listed conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1">, global investment firm </span><span class="s3">KKR &amp; Co</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> China and Beijing-based venture capital company Source Code Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the third quarter, we saw increased scrutiny of fintech companies and their links to capital outflow, as well as concerns over initial coin offerings, both of which impacted deal activity,” said Paul Haswell, a partner at international law firm </span><span class="s3">Pinsent Masons</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China had imposed draconian measures to manage outbound payments and investments after its foreign-exchange reserves fell by nearly US$1 trillion over a period of two and a half years from their June 2014 peak. Reserves have stopped shrinking as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's foreign-exchange reserves climbed for the eighth consecutive month to US$3.1 trillion in September, up US$17 billion from August, according to the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's central bank last month imposed a ban on ICOs - unregulated fundraising through the issue of digital currency - for being illegal and fraudulent [http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2109683/china-bans-initial-coin-offerings-over-concern-about].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Haswell said the slide in third-quarter fintech deals was not indicative of a general decline in interest for such investments on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's just a blip,” he said. “Despite being the focus of so many investors, fintech is still a relatively new concept.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two other major mainland fintech deals last quarter were the US$117.6 million funding raised by Dashu Finance, an online lender based in Shenzhen, and US$45 million in financing received by Nanjing-headquartered Fangsiling, which offers rent instalment payment options to young professionals.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has been haemorrhaging funds for nearly two years but it could be coming to an end, according to a widely watched indicator released by the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan positions accumulated from foreign exchange purchases fell 821 million yuan (US$125.36 million) in August - the 22nd monthly decline in a row, according to data published by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A drop in the figure means China has reported a net capital outflow - the bigger the drop, the larger the outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the decline in August was much smaller than the 4.6 billion yuan fall in July and the 34 billion yuan decrease in June - showing that the cash exodus is starting to wane.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘A yuan should be a yuan', deputy head of China's foreign exchange regulator says[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2111045/yuan-should-be-yuan-deputy-head-chinas-foreign-exchange-regulator]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the same month last year, yuan positions plunged by nearly 200 billion yuan. That compares to the 700 billion yuan decline at the height of China's capital outflows in December 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trajectory of changes in yuan positions is in line with other indicators measuring capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's foreign exchange reserves have gone up for seven consecutive months to August, when they were firmly above US$3 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the yuan has gained about 6 per cent against the dollar so far this year. The central bank earlier this month tweaked the rules so that the yuan could weaken a bit against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Lei, deputy chief of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said at a forum last week that China would continue to move towards a market-oriented yuan exchange rate policy mechanism, reflecting Beijing's confidence in capital flows and the value of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy with </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong, wrote in a recent note that the Chinese authorities were feeling more comfortable about the exchange rate and reserves outlook thanks to “solid economic growth and subsiding capital outflow pressure”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These conditions may lead to a further unwinding of temporary measures to curb outflows and pave the way for the next round of financial reforms and yuan internationalisation,” Liu noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government imposed draconian curbs on outbound payments and remittances at the end of last year and tightened foreign exchange purchases by individuals, although the annual quota of US$50,000 for every mainland citizen was not reduced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan's gains an opportunity for China's central bank to push reform, not a matter of concern[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2110825/yuans-gains-opportunity-chinas-central-bank-push-reform-not-matter]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Williams, chief Asia economist with </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1">, wrote in a note this week that Chinese policymakers would want to introduce more uncertainty on the outlook of the yuan exchange rate as “depreciation pressure has abated”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan positions accumulated from foreign exchange purchases have huge implications for China's domestic monetary policy as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> tries to defend the yuan, it buys every incoming dollar by issuing about 6.5 yuan. The issued yuan in turn becomes additional liquidity in the banking system. When funds leave China, it has a contracting effect on the country's monetary supply.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 22-month net loss of funds has greatly lowered domestic money supply. China's M2 money supply growth decelerated to 8.9 per cent at the end of August, the lowest expansion recorded since the monthly data became available in 1996. The growth rate was also far below the government's target for 2017, which is 12 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have raised the biggest volume of US dollar bonds in the second quarter since 2014, against the backdrop of a continued devaluation of the yuan, and China's top-down efforts to curb capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sales of dollar bonds by some of the country's largest biggest SOEs rose to a record US$18.7 billion in the April-June period, 80 per cent higher than the average in the previous four quarters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In comparison, overall issuance by Chinese companies shrank 11 per cent as a weakening yuan drove up the cost of servicing overseas debt, Bloomberg reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Iris Pang, a senior economist with </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1"> Hong Kong, said the difference in appetite of SOEs and private companies for funds from the US shows the former may have become an illustration of how the central government wants to absorb US dollars, and to replenish China's shrinking foreign reserve pool as capital outflow intensifies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yimin, an economist with Shanghai based Shenwan Hongyuan Securities said: “Everyone knows that at a time when the US dollar is strengthening and interest rates are rising, raising dollar denominated bonds is becoming more expansive, particularly for SOEs who usually enjoy favourable and cheap credit in China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since late last year, a rising number of companies, particularly property developers who used to rely heavily on funding from the US, have been paying back their dollar bonds in advance to save costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li added historically, the second quarter would witness higher issuance of dollar bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be very hard to prove the US dollars the SOEs raised overseas are or will be repatriated to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But economically, for companies focused on domestic development, it makes no sense to raise dollar bonds now,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has declined 3 per cent against the US dollar in the second quarter, the most on record, continuing a devaluation trend, despite the country's senior officials reiterated there was no basis for a continued depreciation of the currency.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, an estimate by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> showed a significant pickup in FX outflows to US$49 billion in June, up from US$25 billion in May, suggesting the weakening yuan during May and June may have affected sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early June, China's top economic planner, the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC) allowed 21 companies — including the nation's biggest banks — to sell foreign-currency debt without having to first seek approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is encouraging companies to bring the proceeds onshore to convert into yuan, the NDRC said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The NDRC also encouraged local companies in China's four free-trade zones (FTZ) — rather than their overseas units — to issue bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to China's administrative rules, companies registered in the FTZs should repatriate funds raised overseas to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Development Bank Corp</span><span class="s1">, one of the 21 firms included in the pilot programme, will hold investor meetings for dollar bond issuance on Tuesday, mainland media reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Official numbers shows China's foreign-exchange reserves unexpectedly increased by US$13 billion to $3.21 trillion in June, as haven assets such as the Japanese yen appreciated amid the UK's decision to leave the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange continued to be lacklustre on Thursday, with turnover down for a third straight day as investor concern over capital outflows amid expectations of interest rate increases refused to go away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The turnover on the main board touched HK$79 billion (US$10.06 billion), 17 per cent lower than Monday's HK$95.7 billion. This figure has stayed below HK$100 billion in the past six sessions -</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">in the first seven months of the year, the average daily turnover was HK$121 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's very likely the [US] </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will increase rates again next month,” said Conita Hung, director of investment strategy at Gransing Securities. “The chance is high that Hong Kong will follow suit. If Hong Kong doesn't, the widening interest difference will further increase capital outflow pressure, which in turn will weigh on the stock market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hung said another uncertainty was any potential response by China to US tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods next month, which might further weaken the yuan or trigger tit-for-tat tariff measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflows have accelerated this month, and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> - the city's de facto central bank - has had to intervene in the currency market on eight occasions to defend the local currency after the Hong Kong dollar hit the 7.85 level, the weak end of its peg to the US dollar. Its intervention has resulted in a reduction in the city's aggregate balance, which measures the liquidity of the banking system, to its lowest level since 2008.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US interest rate rise announced early yesterday is likely to lead to increased capital outflow from Hong Kong and the mainland, according to analysts</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, December 13</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We start today with a tale of two cities, Hong Kong and Bangkok. As in Charles Dickens' original story of that name, this is about people fleeing, but for their money rather than their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong first. Look at the two lines that swing sharply up and down in the first chart. These represent total annual capital inflows and outflows as a percentage of gross domestic product and two things immediately stand out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first is that the two are almost exactly matched, which poses a question.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second obvious feature of the chart is the scale of these flows.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is expected to maintain a tight grip on capital outflows despite foreign exchange reserves rising for a fifth straight month in June, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, July 11</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here is a little secret about how the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> treats foreign reserves at home in its own books.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It calls them foreign assets, it expresses them only in yuan and not in US dollar terms as it does the separate foreign reserves entry and, most of all, it shows them at the original cost of acquisition, not at current market values as it does for foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If it had shown them at current market value, then at the height of their build-up in mid-2015, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would also have shown an unrealised currency translation loss of about US$760 billion, or about 200 times its own capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, with a drawdown in reserves and a somewhat weaker US dollar this has now become only about US$190 billion or about 60 times capital. No, they never rushed to tell you about all this.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the reason I tell you now is that the contrast between these two accounting treatments also allows me to tell you that, as the first chart shows, foreign reserves have not really risen for the last five months, not as in a return to a build-up of reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China to maintain tight rein on capital outflows despite gains in forex reserves[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/2101975/china-maintain-tight-rein-capital-outflows-despite-gains]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All that has happened is that the reserves have risen in US dollar terms because their non-US dollar components have risen in dollar terms with a weaker dollar. I know this because the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s yuan accounts continue to show foreign assets declining. It's slow but it's still down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even this, however, does not tell you the full story about capital outflows. The reserves are only a balancing item on the balance of payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus if the current account, which represents trade transactions, shows a US$170 billion net inflow and the capital account, which represents investment transactions, shows a US$170 billion outflow, the two will be balanced and that balancing item of foreign reserves will not change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there will still have been that US$170 billion capital outflow despite the tight grip exerted by the authorities. And this is what has transpired over the last year, right to that US$170 billion number.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, it is probably more than this. The second chart shows you that the current account and merchandise trade balances were equal in early 2010. Since then other trade components of the current account have gone into deficit so that the current account surplus is now barely a third of the trade surplus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forget the statements, China's capital outflow is still enormous[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2070143/forget-statements-chinas-capital-outflow-still-enormous]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two trends are notable here. For one, mainland tourist spending per person has unaccountably doubled over the last five years. I suspect that at least US$100 billion a year of this is people stashing, rather than spending, money abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There was also a big plunge in net unrequited transfers over the last five years. I would guess about US$40 billion of this is undeclared capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus the exodus continues, slower, but still flowing out.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's yuan extended gains on Wednesday as worries eased over potential capital outflows from the country, and after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">raised the daily reference rate for a second day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan rose to 0.13 per cent to 6.8221 per dollar on Wednesday, helping a recovery from an almost 7 per cent decline since mid-June. Offshore yuan eased slightly by 0.06 per cent to 6.8245 per dollar, after surging 0.66 per cent yesterday in its biggest daily gain since March 26.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The tone for the Chinese yuan is bearish but the market's resolve to take the currency above 7 (to the US dollar) does not match that of the policymakers to cap it at the same level,” said Philip Wee, currency strategist at </span><span class="s3">DBS Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sentiment further stabilised after data on Tuesday showed that foreign reserves unexpectedly rose for a second month to US$3.118 trillion in July, exceeding a US$3.107 trillion forecast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the increase mainly came from foreign investment after China opened up more sectors, especially after global index provider MSCI's inclusion of yuan-denominated equities in its indices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has also reportedly been talking up the yuan, telling Chinese commercial banks on Monday to avoid “herd behaviour” when trading the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That came just after it raised the reserve requirement ratio to 20 per cent from zero for financial institutions when they conduct onshore yuan forwards business on behalf of customers, making it more expensive to short the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> also lifted the yuan's daily midpoint by 0.17 per cent to 6.8313 per dollar earlier in the day. Traders are allowed to trade the currency up to 2 per cent on either side of the fix.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said however that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s measures so far did not necessarily point to a change in course from yuan depreciation to appreciation, unless the dollar started to weaken against major currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors are starting to see value following sharp asset price declines over the past few months,” said Khoon Go, head of Asia research at </span><span class="s3">ANZ Bank</span><span class="s1">. “However, a more meaningful return of inflows will depend on US-China trade tensions easing, or at the very least not deteriorating further.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent list of penalties on entities that breach cross-border fund flows announced by the foreign exchange regulator, </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, is also likely to have curbed capital outflow pressure, said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at </span><span class="s3">ING Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The focus may turn to Chinese trade data that is due later today. Exports are projected to have risen by 10 per cent in July while imports are expected to increase by around 16.5 per cent, resulting in a narrower trade surplus of US$38.92 billion, compared to US$41.47 billion in June, according to Bloomberg data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trade war is not the only factor for Beijing to worry about from the US, with China also needing to carefully watch any monetary tightening from across the Pacific, despite the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s decision on Wednesday to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the trade disputes between Beijing and Washington are grabbing headlines as punitive tariffs and import restrictions threaten to affect China's exports, a continuous rise in the US interest rate level - after the 10-year yield of the benchmark US treasury bills hit a four-year high - may translate into growing capital outflow pressure on China to disrupt Beijing's efforts of reducing financial risks, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed is still on course to raise its benchmark rate further, despite a pause after six benchmark rate hikes since December 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US Treasury bond yields could be signalling trouble ahead[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2115653/us-treasury-bond-yields-could-be-signalling-trouble-ahead]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The interest rate gap between the two economies - a key factor underlying cross-border capital flows - has narrowed to about 60 basis points after the 10-year US treasury yield surpassed the psychological mark of 3 per cent late last month, for the first time since January 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A decent interest rate gap between China and US, and the resulting net capital inflows, had allowed the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to maintain ample domestic liquidity. Capital outflow, or even a drying up of inflow, could push the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> into dangerous territory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Symbolic US Treasury bond yields matter less than the impact of soaring debt levels[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2143466/symbolic-us-treasury-bond-yields-matter-less-impact-soaring]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Any [US] actions that are bigger than expected, such as a steep rise of bond yield, could exert great pressure on China and divert its neutral monetary stance to pro-tightening,” said Ding Shuang, chief China economist of Standard Chartered Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, a tightened monetary policy stance could reduce liquidity in China and create immediate debt repayment stress at home, Ding said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has been responding to US rate hikes only by raising short-term interbank policy rates 5 or 10 basis points each time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, it had resorted a broad-based cut in required reserve ratio - the ratio of deposit a commercial bank is told to give the central bank - to provide additional liquidity to the banking system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing had been caught in a vicious cycle of yuan depreciation and capital outflows when the US tapered quantitative easing and kick-started the rate hikes at the end of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the situation has improved thanks to its economic recovery and strict capital account control.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's newly appointed central bank governor Yi Gang put on a brave face in addressing the external pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi said at a forum last month that the bilateral interest rate gap had stayed in a “comfort zone” of 80-100 basis points and China was “well prepared” to handle rate hikes in other countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will continue to be prudent … The current setting of monetary policy and interest rate gap is overall stable and good for the economic development,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen Wenzuo, a bond analyst with Zheshang Futures in Chinese city of Hangzhou, said the central bank could tolerate a narrower spread between China-US bond yield because their relevance had been weakened and outflow pressure had ebbed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yield of 10-year Chinese treasury bonds has dropped by nearly 40 basis points so far this year to about 3.6 per cent, as supported by the “marginal loosening” of monetary policy and the government's cost reduction efforts, one of four tasks in the country's ongoing structural reforms, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A high interest rate does no good to the economy,” Shen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ming Ming, chief fixed-income analyst of Citic Securities, said the rise of US treasury yield may have overshot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rise has deviated from fundamentals and its sustainability remains doubtful,” he wrote in a recent research note. As such, its impact on China may be limited.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> yield retreated slightly on Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee kept rates unchanged and reiterated inflation was moving towards its target.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shootings and bombings that killed more than 132 people in Paris touched the nerves of Chinese investors more than usual, as many fret worried investors will accelerate pulling their money from emerging markets and plunking them down into safer assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The nature of the attacks suggests an escalation in the intensity of the terrorist threat and geopolitical risks. It may strongly enhance the risk-off sentiment, given investors are already adjusting their portfolio to catch up with the US rate hike, said Hong Hao, managing director with Bocom International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The uncertainties of war and potential terror on other international cities are impossible to quantify. Non-commercial traders' long dollar positions seem light given geopolitical risks," he said, noting investors tend to increase their exposure to the US currency for at least the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The dollars' strength will continue to pressure commodities, emerging markets and other riskier assets. Fund flows to onshore and offshore China ETFs already appear to be rolling over, for example."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yimin, a senior macro economist with Shenwan Hongyuan Securities based in Beijing, said the influence of the Paris attack may exceed peoples' expectations, as it indicated an escalated terrorism threat, and would accelerate capital flow to safe haven assets including the US currency in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, capital outflow pressure for China seems coming back again since November, as EPFR data shows a net US$662 million flew out of China last week. This came after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> and other Chinese financial institutions reported net foreign currency purchases worth US$2 billion, a sign of capital inflows in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is also following closely its campaign to become a reserve currency in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">, which is due to hand down its decision on November 30.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We understand the SDR campaign is high up on the political agenda for party leaders, but the more pressing issue is the US rate hike. The membership of the SDR is unlikely to reverse the capital outflow and yuan devaluation momentum," said an unnamed economist work with a state-owned bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts outside China tend to read less into the terror attack in Paris, while having their attention focused on the upcoming Fed meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The markets will step away from this tragedy and look to the Fed for the most meaningful near term impact. Japan's disappointing GDP number today suggest more monetary easing and that will be coupled with </span><span class="s3">ECB</span><span class="s1"> continued easing these are the narratives that will take the attention away from Paris soon enough," Brett Mcgonegal, chief executive of Reorient Group, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Personally, I do not think the Paris incident will necessarily become a trigger for major capital outflows. As you can see, the global stock market correction was mostly subdued," said Kay Van Petersen, vice president of Saxo Capital Markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the real risk, or a game change will come if another attack breaks out in Europe or the US."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Islamist group ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris, has warned Paris is only the beginning and that it would launch attacks in other major cities and in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outside China, risk-off trading has been spreading across Asia last week on worries the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will raise US interest rates for the first time in a decade at its December meeting and a disappointing flow of macro data, said a note issued by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The MSCI Asia Pacific Ex Japan Index slid 3 per cent in the past week, led by the fall in Taiwan's stock market. Taiwan had seen the biggest weekly capital outflow in 20 months. The Korean won and Malaysian ringgit depreciated 2 per cent against the US dollar, the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Haefele, the global chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management said the Paris attack and other recent tragic events including atrocities in Turkey and Lebanon and the heightened degree of uncertainties are likely to "lead to higher volatility for markets in the near-term", although how long-lasting the effects will be depends on a lot of factors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For context, Spanish consumer confidence took three months to recover from the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and overseas arrivals into the US took more than six years to recover after 9/11," he wrote in a note on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity by mainland Chinese companies in the United States dropped in the first half to just 22 per cent of the combined value of such deals a year earlier, due to the double whammy of Washington's protectionist leanings and Beijing's tighter capital outflow scrutiny, according to an industry report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months of this year, the mainland ranked as the ninth biggest M&amp;A investor in the United States with US$6.1 billion worth of deals, compared with US$27.5 billion in the same period in 2016, said the joint report from law firm </span><span class="s3">White &amp; Case</span><span class="s1"> and M&amp;A data provider Mergermarket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The result was in sharp contrast to last year, when the mainland was the third biggest M&amp;A investor into the US, trailing only Canada and Ireland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sharp decline this year was due to the tighter scrutiny from regulators in both jurisdictions, though for different reasons, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the world's largest economy, heightened concern around US national security amid the Trump administration's "America First" rhetoric has given regulators greater reason to rigorously scrutinise investments from China and other countries perceived to have more liberal trade relationships with countries less friendly to the US, said Christopher Kelly, a </span><span class="s3">White &amp; Case</span><span class="s1"> partner leading the firm's M&amp;A practice in Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While in China, Beijing has signalled tighter scrutiny of capital outflow since last year against a weakening yuan, which lost nearly 7 per cent in 2016 as the worst performing major Asian currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A tighter fist on fighting "irrational" outbound investments was also apparent, reflected in high drama this summer, when big-name private Chinese conglomerates - Wanda, Fosun, HNA and Anbang, together with a vehicle used by Chinese businessman Li Yonghong to acquire Italian soccer club </span><span class="s3">AC Milan</span><span class="s1"> - were singled out for close scrutiny by domestic banks, under a directive by the banking regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ongoing scrutiny, reflected by the curbs on the "big-four" most active Chinese acquires, also put the brakes on deals from the mainland, with the hits expected to roll well into the second half of this year, Kelly said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deals worth more than US$2 billion can now expect tighter scrutiny from the mainland's foreign exchange authorities, he noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese regulators step in to calm market jitters over crackdown of overseas asset acquisitions[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2105282/chinas-insurance-regulator-says-it-has-no-plan-ask-anbang]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Amid that trend, we have already seen two things happen: one is greater emphasis from Chinese investors on countries in Europe, such as Germany," Kelly told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The other is the return of financial sponsors and strategic investors from western markets seeking better opportunities [when there are fewer bidders from China]."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the short-term slowdown, he said he is still optimistic about outbound M&amp;As from China as a result of its rising economic clout and attempts to move up the value chain, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly rose last month to return to a level above US$3 trillion, marking the first accumulation since last June as the Chinese government's efforts in curbing capital outflow begin to show effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's foreign exchange reserves were US$3.0051 trillion at the end of February, a modest rise of US$6.9 billion from a reading of US$2.9982 trillion at the end of January, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A rise in reserves can help shore confidence in the yuan exchange rate and offer Beijing more leverage in pushing up the value of the yuan value against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has depleted about US$1 trillion in its foreign exchange reserves since June 2014 to prevent a quick depreciation of the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the annual government work report delivered to the National People's Congress on Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang changed the country's long-standing rhetoric on its yuan policy, signalling Beijing could alter course on exchange rates this year under pressure from US Federal Reserve rate rises and US President Donald Trump's threats of a trade war.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first time in history, the central government included a requirement to ensure the stable global status of the yuan as one of its major tasks, dropping the line “keeping a stable yuan at a reasonable and balanced level” that has been included in the government work report for the past three years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall in China's foreign ­exchange reserves accelerated in November even though Beijing is gradually closing the door on ­capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The larger-than-expected decline in the world's biggest stockpile of foreign exchange exposed the flaws in Beijing's current ­approach of selling state reserves to support the yuan and was very likely to force the authorities to take a stricter line on outbound investment and payments, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves shrank by US$69.1 billion last month to US$3.052 trillion, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Wednesday. The mainland has lost nearly US$1 trillion worth of reserves since the figure peaked in June 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">November's drop, the largest monthly fall since January, came as the US dollar index hit a 13-year high following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential ­election.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tim Condon, chief Asia economist at ING in Singapore, said the rapid fall was undermining the Chinese government's plan of a gradual and orderly decline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/12/07/c972e6c4-bc8c-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_image_hires.jpg]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The authorities will respond by tightening capital controls and stabilising the daily midpoint, which they have done in past episodes of market turbulence,” Condon said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a joint statement released on Tuesday, the central bank and the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1">, the state's economic planning agency, warned of “irrational investment” in foreign properties, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and soccer clubs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Documents obtained earlier by the South China Morning Post show capital outflow controls are already in force involving forex clearance for outbound investment of more than US$5 million, plus stricter reviews in place over very large deals. Both outbound investment and these mega deals are set to limit the speed and size of capital flow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The recent control measures are pre-emptive to prevent capital outflow pressure from rising on the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s highly likely interest rate rise in December,” said Zhu Qibing, chief macro analyst at mainland brokerage </span><span class="s3">CITIC Securities International</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall in the value of the yuan, the reduction in foreign exchange reserves and the government measures to control outbound investment have all come at once.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have dealt a blow to Beijing's ambitions to make the yuan an international reserve currency along with the US dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen, which together comprise the special drawing rights basket of the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's efforts to calm market concerns about the yuan's value, or breaking the one-way bet on the yuan's depreciation, have so far achieved only limited success, if any at all.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China’s central bank</span><span class="s1"> said on Saturday evening that CNY, or onshore-traded yuan, would be allowed to fluctuate up to 2 per cent above or below the officially set midpoint rate against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> last widened the trading band, in April 2012, it prompted an abrupt rise in volatility on the spot market, and the yuan, also known as the renminbi, was traded to the top of the band soon after.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time, however, traders have reacted more calmly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the midpoint at 6.1321 yuan to the US dollar on Monday, 25 basis points stronger than last Friday. The central bank sets the benchmark rate each trading day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the onshore spot market, the currency was trading at 6.1639 per dollar at 1:35pm, 133 basis points, or 0.22 per cent, weaker than its previous close. In the offshore market, the yuan slightly weakened by 58 basis points, or 0.09 per cent, to trade at 6.1601 per US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Traders did not in particular sell yuan this morning because of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> announcement, as this news has already been largely priced in over the past month,” DBS strategist Tommy Ong told the Post.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Demand and supply of the onshore renminbi is at a balanced level right now, so I don’t see the exchange rate falling much further. We had a trade deficit in February, which means bigger supply of the renminbi, but when we entered March, the supply came back to normal.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some economists and strategists worried that short-term capital outflows would follow the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">’s announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While we maintain our longer-term view of further CNY appreciation, the potential shorter-term risk of capital outflow (given the softening economic backdrop) must be acknowledged,” Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Asian currency and rates strategy at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, wrote in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors should watch upcoming Chinese data closely for indications of whether capital outflow is probable in the CNY space following this band widening. In addition, investors should be aware of the heightened credit risks that exist in the trust product space from May through September.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three crucial indicators in the near term are the </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> flash PMI on March 24, the official PMI on April 1 and the trade balance around April 10, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is it US$19 billion, US$28 billion or US$50 billion - what is the actual size of China's exodus of funds?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank publishes three monthly indicators that gauge the size of funds leaving the country - the official foreign exchange reserves, the central bank's yuan positions accumulated from foreign exchange purchases, and transaction balances between commercial banks and their clients.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the three indicators do not cover the same thing, and are not always consistent, in September they indicated that capital was leaving not only in greater amounts, but at an accelerated rate. However, widening divergence among the numbers left many analysts scratching their heads over how much had actually had left the country.[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/10/25/c3565dca-9ab8-11e6-9654-6e2b0a6d20cd_image_hires.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a matter of great interest to analysts and speculators because the outside world often has to rely on the limited availability of the data to judge not only the extent of China's capital outflow but also how committed the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">is to intervening in the foreign exchange markets to defend the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data released on October 7 showed that the country's foreign exchange reserves shrank by US$18.8 billion in September, but the central bank said two weeks later that it sold a net 337.5 billion yuan (HK$386.5 billion) worth of foreign exchange, or roughly US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest data from the ­foreign exchange administration shows Chinese investors bought a net 189.7 billion yuan worth of ­foreign exchange, or about US$28 billion, further blurring the ­picture.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaignThe </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and Beijing are using other tricks or pools of money to buy the yuan without using official foreign reservesChristopher Balding, associate professor, Peking University's </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> Business School</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and Beijing are using other tricks or pools of money to buy the yuan without using official foreign reserves," said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at Peking University's </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> Business School. "They are using other pools of capital to soak up the downward pressure on the yuan as it leaves China."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank and the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said that capital outflow from the country was under control and that foreign currency was in high demand from Chinese outbound tourists ahead of the week-long National Day holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ruan Jianhong, the head of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s statistics department, said valuation changes in the country's US$3.17 trillion reserve assets, caused by a stronger US dollar, could partly explain the inconsistency between the indicators. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> did not publish detailed breakdowns of China's reserves so it was hard to verify the claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But economists said the real situation could be much more complicated than the official comments suggested. "Our guess is that the real drop of the foreign exchange reserve is larger than US$18.8 billion," said Xie Yaxuan, head of research at China Merchants Securities in Shenzhen who has previously worked as a foreign exchange official.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xie said discrepancies between the foreign exchange reserve changes and the yuan positions "became particularly significant in August and September" and "it is a problem of perplexity to understand the divergence of indicators" due to the lack of data from the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is under pressure to weaken further against the dollar, and hit new six-year lows one after another this month.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's tighter controls on capital outflow would curb outbound investment by Chinese firms in the short term and possibly stalling some high-profile deals, according the market watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they expect the trend of mainland enterprises expanding overseas to revive once the authorities relax restrictions in the coming months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stuart Crow, the head of Asia-Pacific Capital Markets for JLL, said investing overseas was a strategic move for most Chinese investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While there may be some short-term slowdown or delay, we expect few long-term structural changes. The trend of Chinese capital going out for real estate is not stopping. If anything, it is going to gather momentum due to the enormous capital base in China," Crow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the third quarter of 2016, China overtook the United States to become the largest cross-border property investor, having invested nearly US$18 billion in commercial property assets internationally in the first three quarters of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Denis Ma, the head of research at JLL in Hong Kong, said mainland buyers have invested more than US$2.9 billion in Hong Kong's commercial property market this year, more than the combined amount of the next four cities it looked at in Asia-Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The expected slowdown in deal flow is likely to also curtail the run-up in prices we've seen over the past year given that mainland buyers have been the most aggressive in bidding up prices," Ma said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also heard some deals were held up because the mainland buyers had not secured government approval to remit foreign currencies overseas despite submitting the applications in November and December. Previously, approvals would be issued in just one or two weeks," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he expects the rule might be eased after the Lunar New Year, noting that restrictions on capital outflow used to be tighter at the end of a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said the investment market is basically dominated by deals worth about HK$2 billion to HK$5 billion.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Hong Kong, Britain, Singapore and Australia would continue to be the hot spots for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In order to attract investors from Asia-Pacific, Burlington Arcade in London, an iconic shopping area in the city, is up for sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The arcade is the longest covered shopping street in Britain with approximately 37,000 square feet of retail space and a combined frontage of more than 1,100 square feet, according to sole agent CBRE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Surveyors estimated the retail premises will fetch £400 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Savills</span><span class="s1"> said overseas investors deployed more money into Central London last year than 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said overseas investors spent £12.62 billion, accounting for 79 per cent of the £15.91 billion total turnover in Central London in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors from Hong Kong poured £1.61 billion into Central London, while mainland investors deployed £1.52 billion in the city last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oliver Watt, Savills director for Asia, said the restriction was unlikely to pose a severe threat to property investment in London.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Watt said that while mainland companies faced challenges sending money out of the country, "they can proceed with their overseas investments through other alternatives - including their Hong Kong-listed vehicles or offshore units to raise capital".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology, consumption upgrade and Belt and Road Initiative are expected to account for a sizeable chunk of outbound Chinese investment in the next few years, said the head of China Everbright on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese outbound investment will continue to be "the big trend" despite a spate of challenges, including tighter regulatory scrutiny, Chen Shuang, chief executive officer of China Everbright, the Hong Kong listed arm of the state-owned conglomerate </span><span class="s3">China Everbright Group</span><span class="s1">, told the China M&amp;A Forum 2017 in Shanghai, in his keynote address.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese consumers are increasingly showing a stronger consumption demand, such as on films and entertainment, and are readily willing to spend," he said and that this should boost confidence in the growth of consumer related sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Everbright has also teamed up </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, a US venture capital firm and Tencent, one of China's biggest internet companies, to cash in on the trend of consumption upgrade, Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's domestic consumption picked up momentum in September, reflected by a retail sales rise of 10.3 per cent, up from 10.1 per cent in August, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said on the sidelines of the forum that there were already some signs of loosening regarding outbound investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China "is likely" to encourage some government-backed institutions to let yuan sail outbound and there could be a policy to allow direct outbound investment soon, he said without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outbound investments still encouraged, despite Beijing's curbs on ‘irrational' deals [http://www.scmp.com/special-reports/business/topics/accounting-and-auditing/article/2111288/outbound-investments-still]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China ramped up capital outflow scrutiny last year and has issued policies to try to control irrational outbound investment, particularly cross-border merger and acquisition deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council in August formerly endorsed the scrutiny on paper by listing categories where outbound investments were encouraged, restricted and banned. Property, hotel, entertainment and sports club come under the restrictive sectors and investors need special approval from Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's outbound merger and acquisition deals slumped 35 per cent year on year in the first three quarters of 2017 to US$95.9 billion, according to data from Mergermarket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On top of tighter capital outflow scrutiny from regulators, Chinese investors could also be confronted with difficulties including financing overseas and national security scrutiny in investment destination nations.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With tighter scrutiny at home, Chinese buyers are also faced with a burden to assure jittery foreign sellers concerned about regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese buyers could face an average 5 per cent to 10 per cent deposit, or break-up fee, from foreign buyers against the backdrop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Over the years, it has been noticed that deposit requirements have become stricter," said Huang Min, deputy general manager, merger and acquisition office, </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outbound Chinese merger and acquisition deals might be delayed but are unlikely to stop, he said, noting that he has seen a strong demand from Chinese listed companies to seek outbound deals.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global stock markets had "horrendous" first two weeks of 2016, triggered by the sell-off in Chinese markets and fears of further yuan devaluation, said Bernard Aw, an analyst from </span><span class="s3">IG Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meantime, US markets continued to face challenges of weak corporate earnings and a strong US dollar, "providing few impetus to push higher".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Fear dominated the first two weeks," Aw said, adding that recent economic data suggested that markets could see "more deterioration in the global economy before things get better".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking forward, he said traders will closely watch a number of key data for economic clues, including China's Q4 and 2015 GDP, US housing and CPI data, and dozens of US companies' quarterly financial results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Judy Chang, chief investment officer for CIFM Asset Management, said the economy showed some signs of stabilising recently. He expected the Chinese economy to bottom out and pick up in the second quarter, as the fiscal stimulus package starts to take effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Chinese government will be keen to maintain a at least mild bull market, to prepare favorable conditions for kicking off the registration-based initial public offering reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, we heard the regulators overseeing the banking, securities and insurance markets are set to strengthen coordination in supporting the stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another challenging factor is China's supply-side reform, highlighted by the leadership since December, while a serious cut in oversupply will squeeze companies' earnings broadly, before it is accomplished with a more efficient economic system establishes."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kai Hu, senior vice president from </span><span class="s3">Moody's Investors Service</span><span class="s1">, said:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China's suspension of fuel-price adjustments when crude oil falls below US$40 a barrel is credit positive for the country's national oil companies because profits from their refining business will rise, partially offsetting profit declines in the upstream exploration and production (E&amp;P) segment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On 13 January 2016, the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC) changed its pricing policy on refined products. The new policy allows the NDRC to stop reducing the prices of refined-oil products when crude prices are below US$40 per barrel.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China National Petroleum Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (CNPC, Aa3 stable), </span><span class="s3">China Petrochemical Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (Sinopec Group, Aa3 stable) and </span><span class="s3">China National Offshore Oil Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Aa3 stable) will benefit as the pricing floor will result in higher profits for their refining businesses. Higher profits from the refining business will likely moderate the negative impact of lower crude prices on the companies' E&amp;P businesses."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo, director of Tung Shing Futures, said the HK dollar hitting a four-year low of 7.7894 Thursday was a result of the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Obviously, the international investors do not have expect the stock market would bounce back much in future. They sold from the stock market and leave the money out of Hong Kong to other markets. It is likely the currency would continue to be weak for the near future," Lo said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further depreciation of the Chinese yuan and possible policy mismanagement could trigger more volatility in emerging markets this year, </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> predicted in a recent research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China will be a growing source of volatility in the region, as the adoption of the CNY basket creates significant room for USD/CNY upside as the Fed-PBoC divergence builds without disrupting the trade-weighted rate," analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The German investment bank said the yuan falling to 7 to the US dollar is a "reasonable target" for the year. However, depreciations are "intrinsically difficult to manage", analysts noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The room left for (the yuan's) depreciation vs. the </span><span class="s3">USD</span><span class="s1"> and risk of policy mismanagement could trigger further intra-EMFX (emerging-market currencies) adjustments and bouts of volatility," they added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In our view, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">is trying to gain more freedom in monetary policy on the back of foreseeable monetary tightening by the Fed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in view of the costs from capital outflow, the central bank will likely opt for both tightening capital control and maintaining dollar exchange rate stability in the near term, instead of free-floating the currency or initiating a large one-off devaluation against the dollar.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan endured a roller-coaster ride on Tuesday, bouncing back sharply in the afternoon from a 11-month low in the morning, after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> issued a statement during the lunch break in trading, saying it would support the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency was trading at 6.70 against the US dollar in the morning amid worries about an intensified trade war between the United States and China. The onshore and offshore yuan rose by more than 500 basis points to 6.60 levels on Tuesday afternoon, following the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">'s statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan, traded by international investors, was changing hands at 6.6818 to the US dollar at 4pm in Hong Kong, 508 basis points above its rate - 6.7320 - in the morning, which was 0.7 per cent lower than Monday's close. It last traded below 6.70 on August 8, 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan, traded on the mainland, recovered by 521 basis points to trade at 6.6647 at 4pm, up from 6.7168 per US dollar in the morning, which was 0.9 per cent lower than Monday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan drops faster than onshore currency as trade war fears, central bank policies spook international investors[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2153087/offshore-yuan-drops-faster-onshore-currency-trade-war-fears]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sharp decline in morning trade has been attributed to traders betting on the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> further weakening the yuan in preparation for an intensified trade conflict with the US. As of Tuesday morning, the offshore yuan had dropped for 14 consecutive days and was down by a total of 5.4 per cent from June 13. Its losing streak started the following day, after the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> opted not to follow the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> in raising interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank's statement at lunch, however, put an end to this losing streak. At the same time, mainland China media reported that banks would also support the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, the head of China's foreign exchange regulator and a central-bank deputy governor, told a forum in Hong Kong on Tuesday that China has the “fundamentals, capability and confidence” to keep the currency “generally stable at a reasonable and balanced level”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, posted a Q&amp;A with its governor Yi Gang on its official website after lunch. Yi said the recent fluctuation of the yuan was “mainly caused by a strengthening US dollar and external uncertainties”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He then said China's economy is being transformed into a high-quality growth model, with financial risks under control and capital flows balanced, while the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will work to keep the yuan “generally stable at a reasonable and balanced level”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial News, a state media outlet under the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, said financial risks “were building”, while the dollar may start to come under pressure, in a story published on Tuesday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan strengthened late in the morning, and was trading at 6.6958 by 2pm. By 3pm, the offshore yuan was also back above the 6.70 level, recovering 396 basis points from the lowest point of the morning to trade at 6.6936.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders said some major state-owned banks were seen swapping yuan for dollars in the futures market and immediately selling some of them into the spot market, which helped shore up the Chinese currency, Reuters reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday lowered the yuan's midpoint fixing rate by 0.5 per cent, or 340 basis points, to 6.6497 against the US dollar, having raised it by 0.01 per cent on Monday. Until Friday, the central bank had set the currency's midpoint lower in the previous eight trading days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Analysts are widely speculating that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is willing to see a weaker yuan to prepare for the impact of the trade war,” said Jasper Lo, chief investment strategist at Hong Kong-based Eddid Securities and Futures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current trade war is not just leading to a weaker yuan but also a weaker trend for other emerging market currencies. Traders widely believe US President Donald Trump is very keen on pushing the trade war against China and other countries, and this will lead to a strong US dollar against other currencies. The yuan is likely to trade around 6.70 level for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lo, however, does not believe it will decline much further. “The yuan has gone down a total of 5 per cent in the past 14 trading days. The level of 6.70 per US dollar will be a resistance level. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would like to see a weaker yuan but does not want to repeat the mistake it made in August of 2015, when it fell more than 2 per cent in one day,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market then drove the yuan down much lower and that led to a massive capital outflow. China would not like to see that happen again. If the yuan drops any further, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is likely to take action to support it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia-Pacific at JP Morgan Asset Management, however, said it was unlikely China was using yuan depreciation as a tool in its trade negotiations with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A weaker yuan is seen by some as a warning shot to the US over the trade war. I am still not convinced that this is a credible threat. First, we have already seen the impact on Chinese investors' anxiety over a weaker currency and subsequent capital outflow in 2015 and 2016. This is not a can of worms that Beijing wants to open again,” said Hui.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Second, for all the recent concerns over Chinese companies and their US dollar bonds, a weaker yuan would further increase the pressure on weaker companies to service and repay their US dollar debt. Hence, an arranged yuan depreciation could lead to damage to the economy as much as the original problem [avoiding a trade war] Beijing is trying to tackle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The idea that the yuan has weakened on the back of a strong US dollar is less of a valid argument in the past two weeks since the trade-weighted basket has also weakened sharply. It does reflect the narrowing spreads between US dollar and yuan interest rates. Last week's reserve requirement ratio cut, perhaps, has exacerbated this move,” Hui added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Stability is a must in the year of leadership reshuffles, which means the stabilisation of economic growth and prevention of systematic risks," said Zhang Jun, chief economist of Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, the Wall Street bank's China joint venture.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is also the last economic work conference under the current Politburo. Of seven current standing committee members, five are expected to be replaced - although the personnel changes and even the number of members in the new committee have still not been finalised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For years, Beijing has told the Chinese people it is able to balance "growth, reform and stability". Hopes were high three years ago when the new leadership unveiled its ambitious to-do list, vowing to give the market "a decisive role" in the economy and ease state control of economic activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Disappointment, however, has grown among domestic scholars, foreign officials and China watchers at the limited progress in achieving the promised changes, alongside increasing state intervention. Xi has personally chaired the Central Reform Leading Group and convened 30 sessions in recent years, but the lofty statements put out after these meetings often fail to make substantial changes on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is very difficult to see any meaningful reform, at almost any economic level," said Fraser Howie, the director of Newedge Financial in Singapore and co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundations of China's Extraordinary Rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The concern is stability and control," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For now, Xi and his comrades have made it clear that what they want is a stable economy and social environment in 2017, but that desire doesn't help to address concerns that Beijing is too obsessed with stability to seek real progresses in economic liberalisation, at a time when the country is in dire need of economic restructuring.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's enthusiasm for managed change, after all, has previously translated into policy missteps.

Beijing's hasty efforts to downsize coal and steel by issuing administrative orders also backfired with a coal price rally and concentrated steel capacity in the hands of state steelmakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, meanwhile, many factors are beyond Beijing's control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The unpredictability of Donald Trump, together with all untoward economic incidents such as the stock market crash, currency crisis and housing price bubbles, make Chinese policymakers deeply worried about its economic vulnerability," said Henry Chan Hing Lee, an adjunct research fellow at the </span><span class="s3">National University of Singapore</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said China would significantly slow its financial market liberalisation and tighten up financial sector control, particularly of its capital account.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the Fed is on the path to raise interest rates further and the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has to lean towards tightening, China would see "more financial risks exposed next year" in the form of bond defaults and quickly worsening asset quality at small banks, Zhang Ming, a researcher with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">, warned in a research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Hamilton, a managing director of Moody's Analytics' stress testing and credit risk analytics division, said at a briefing in Beijing on Thursday that China's default rate is expected to rise to around 2 to 2.5 per cent in 2017, or close to "the warning line" of 3 per cent, citing the firm's tracking of about 3,500 firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the Chinese leadership in the late 1990s has the luxury to leverage China's low-cost advantages and to seek integration with the global market, China's current leaders have to face losing their cost advantage and growing complaints from the country's trade partners - such as US president-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese products.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the United States is China's second-largest export destination and contributes to 40 per cent of its trade surplus, "the increase in uncertainty and risk of China-specific trade restrictions [under a Trump administration] will weigh on exports," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When measured by official economic indicators, China's $10 trillion economy is doing well - GDP has expanded at 6.7 per cent for the first, second and third quarters of 2016, the traditional growth engines of industrial production and capital spending are warming up, and industrial profitability is improving thanks to rebounds in industrial input prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, those results are achieved by strengthening, rather than changing, China's old investment-led model. China's growth is neither getting cleaner or greener as Beijing promised.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hope remains that Beijing will enact market-oriented reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Yiping, a macro analyst with China Merchants Securities in Shenzhen, said China might make progress in rural land ownership reform, and China International Finance Corp economists led by Liang Hong wrote that China might improve its personal income tax regime to cut tax burdens directly on wage earners.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing would encourage the Guangdong free-trade zone to cooperate with Hong Kong and Macau in pioneering financial reform as it sought to make the yuan a convertible currency under the capital account "in an orderly manner", Premier Li Keqiang said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, December 3</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is all this about an orderly manner? The mainland's capital account is already wide open for those with enough money to take advantage of it and there has been nothing orderly about the manner in which it happened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I have presented the chart here before and I expect to have plenty of occasion to do it again. The mainland's latest balance of payments indicates a net outflow on the capital account of about US$600 billion over the 12 months to September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I readily admit that this is more than the officialdom concedes but I am also sure I am closer to the truth. My figure treats errors and omissions in the balance of payments as capital flows because this is almost certainly what they are. I also say the tourist-spending figures hide a big element of capital outflow. Even the official figures, however, concede a net outflow of US$380 billion, which is the equivalent of about 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But enough of the technicalities. Nothing like this has ever been seen before, first in it being a net outflow rather than an inflow and second in it being anywhere near this large. The figures suggest that the premier has lost control of cross-border capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And his comments suggest that he does not know it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The large bulk of this exodus of money probably represents export proceeds kept abroad rather than repatriated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of this may be the result of deliberate over-invoicing of exports but most of it, I believe, was made possible by a pronounced decline of commodity prices over the last year, which has made the mainland's imports cheaper.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No matter. It all implies a distinct lack of confidence in the yuan and has so far been reflected in yuan weakness, a notable drawdown of foreign reserves and steady reductions in bank statutory reserve requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">None of these things yet really bites anyone, but this is unlikely to remain the case if the outflow continues at its present rate. At some point Beijing will then have to clamp down in earnest, which will mean onerous restrictions on foreign exchange and a witch-hunt for big players who do not comply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The difficulty in all this is that the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> has just accepted the yuan as a reserve currency for its special drawing rights. This indicates to central banks across the world that the yuan is an officially approved investment for foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having won this beauty contest, for that is what it is, would Beijing really be happy to declare to the world a short time afterwards that the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> got it wrong, that the yuan is still an ugly-duckling currency and should not have been granted this grown-up status yet?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be a severely embarrassing concession to make, but it is nonetheless what a truly effective clampdown on capital movements would constitute. Although this is an outcome that may yet be avoided it lurks as a distinct danger. Which only goes to say that the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> made a mistake in bringing the yuan into SDR status so soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chalk it up as another bad call by IMF managing director Christine "Loose Cannon" Lagarde.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There was time to wait. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> should have waited.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the premier would do well not to commit himself too loudly to financial reforms that circumstances may later force him to abandon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has become an important conduit for laundering money fleeing London, say risk consultants and lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Britain's tightening of money-laundering regulations had resulted in an increasing number of private banks telling customers that their accounts would be closed, said Ambrose Carey, a director of British risk consultancy Alaco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are aware that some of these customers have transferred funds to second-tier financial institutions in Hong Kong," Carey said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Terrorist organisations, which previously saw London as a haven for their funds, felt the need to get their money out of the British capital, said Robert Smith, a deputy high court judge in England. "Hong Kong provides the ideal opportunity now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">British government</span><span class="s1"> would soon publish its first-ever anti-corruption plan, said Attorney-General Jeremy Wright in September, without giving details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This government has made it a priority to ensure we have the laws and structures to tackle fraud and corruption, and improve detection of money laundering," Wright said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government is legislating to implement a central registry of company beneficial ownership to identify and tackle misuse of companies to hide criminal assets. Enhanced transparency of company ownership will help us tackle tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One industry that used Hong Kong as a haven was betting, said Carey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Betting is illegal in mainland China, but punters there could access British bookmakers online, who could remit funds to punters through Hong Kong, he said. "This appears to fall within the rules but raises questions."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carey also said the boom in prime residential property in London over the past decade had been largely fuelled by overseas buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Much of that money has either come from, or been channelled through, Hong Kong. It would be foolish to assume that all the money that has poured into London from Hong Kong is clean," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas buyers spent £2.2 billion (HK$26.7 billion) on property in London in 2012, up from £1.8 billion in 2011, according to consultancy Knight Frank. Hong Kong buyers accounted for 16 per cent of the purchases while mainland Chinese took 5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A significant part of the stratospheric price rises in the London property market is attributed to the influx of foreign money," said Alistair Webster, the head of Lincoln House Chambers, a lawyers' group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The big risk for Hong Kong businesses is the Hong Kong financial sector will be a funnel for money coming from suspect sources and then on to the international market, primarily London. The long history of contact between London and Hong Kong will inevitably play a part in making London the target market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There was a net capital outflow of US$3.1 billion from Hong Kong during the first three quarters of this year, in contrast to a net inflow of US$8.3 billion last year, according to </span><span class="s3">CrossBorder Capital</span><span class="s1">, a London firm that tracks global liquidity flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This switch in fund flow coincides with President Xi Jinping's crackdown on corruption in the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The anti-corruption drive means a significant amount of money formerly seen as legitimate must now be viewed as suspect," Webster said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a gateway for money from a number of countries including China. As long as there is political uncertainty, individuals and corporate entities will want to get money out of Hong Kong. This will result in larger flows of capital to London, and inevitably some of that money will have an illegitimate source."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law enforcement authorities in the West had been co-operating with their Chinese counterparts in pursuing laundered money to a degree that would be surprising a decade ago, said lawyer Jim Sturman,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">CrossBorder Capital</span><span class="s1">, there was a net capital outflow of US$217.9 billion from Britain in the first three quarters of this year, in contrast to a net inflow of US$63.5 billion last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine had upset wealthy Russians with funds based in London, said Smith.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said major Russian corporates had acquired interests in the Hong Kong dollar, which was attractive for unlawfully acquired funds, including those fuelling international terrorism.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan seems to have stalled in its internationalisation, as overseas investors are reluctant to increase yuan holdings amid concerns of capital controls and currency interventions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts still expect China to stick to its yuan i internationalisation plan and gradually open up the onshore asset market, as the country looks likely to uphold a free trade policy even as protectionist forces are on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global foreign exchange reserves held in yuanreached 1.1 per cent[http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/03/31/pr17108-IMF-Releases-Data-on-the-Currency-Composition-of-Foreign-Exchange-Reserves] of total reserves by the end of 2016, way behind its major currency peers, according to a report by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Indeed, its [the yuan's] 1.1 per cent share was more or less the same with the preliminary survey in 2015, indicating mild inflow into yuan assets as a reserve asset after the admission of the yuan into the Special Drawing Right basket,” said Ken Cheung, Asian forex strategist for </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A previous ad-hoc survey by the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> showed[https://www.google.com.hk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6wsDxh4jTAhUGNpQKHVsgAF4QFggYMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imf.org%2Fen%2F~%2Fmedia%2FAF651C1D464A4E21AA94A971A6214818.ashx&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgx5VtpcbQpDiFZDQiA9oANGZ_Vw&amp;sig2=BOhPLaszYoqdecLiOk69PA] 130 countries had held a total of US$74 billion worth of yuan assets by the end of 2014, 1.1 per cent of their total official foreign assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The current yuan share is significantly lower than its 10.92 per cent share in the SDR basket and near 13 per cent share in global trade in 2015, Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's also way behind its peers. As the latest </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> report showed, US dollar assets represented 64 per cent of global forex reserves by the end of 2016, while the euro accounted for 19.7 per cent, the British pound 4.4 per cent, and the Japanese yen 4.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, the latest result is “hardly surprising”, given that China has faced substantial capital outflow pressure since its exchange rate reform in August 2015, Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, China's tight capital control measures remain an important concern for international investors who conduct onshore yuan investment, as they worry about the difficulties in repatriating the capital from within the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This explains the [policymakers'] failure to improve the yuan function of investment and reserves despite the official yuan inclusion in the SDR basket last year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Steven Innes, a senior trader at Oanda Asia Pacific, also said China's previous attempts to curb the yuan's depreciation had caused a funding squeeze in offshore yuan markets and is likely viewed as a “blight” toward China's ultimate goal for yuan internationalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“All too frequent interventions will sour international investor sentiment,” he said, adding that tightening capital controls have also kept investors away from conducting business in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Cheung still expect China to stick with its internationalisation plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With rising protectionism, China seeks to uphold globalisation and the free-trade policy, and in doing so, China could play a larger role on international affairs,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy for </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, said that as the summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump nears, trade tensions are going to be a key focus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in the annual government work report that authorities will “maintain the RMB's stable position in the global economy system” in 2017. That marked a change in the language he used to describe the yuan in the previous years, when he pledged to “keep the yuan stable at an appropriate and balanced level”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The subtle change has sparked speculation that policymakers may be willing to embrace more yuan volatility in 2017 in order to facilitate the goal of currency internationalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi Gang, Deputy Governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, also stressed in a statement this week that yuan internationalisation is a medium-to-long term strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Indeed, the latest </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s statement echoed the comment that ‘maintaining the RMB position in the global monetary system' in the Government Work Report,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In this circumstance, we expect that China will manage to keep the yuan stable in the near term and consider easing its capital outflow control measures later this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's policymakers have already tried to attract capital inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premier Li said in his annual work report last month that policymakers will allow overseas funds to buy onshore bonds in Hong Kong in 2017 through a Bond Connect scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Details on the mechanics, including implementation time frame, were not immediately available, but the general thrust is consistent with other measures to boost market accessibility and encourage inflows,” said Chandler.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect China to open up the onshore asset market gradually and the yuan to depreciate at a modest pace in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We remain of the view that the offshore yuan will undergo a modest depreciation this year, and the potential capital inflow would support the offshore yuan further when investors start to recognise the functions of investment and reserves in yuan assets in the longer term,” Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Juliana Huang, a senior executive with a multinational company in Beijing, invested well during the property boom in the Chinese capital and over the years has owned several flats in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many Chinese investors, however, Huang has in recent times sought to liquidate some of her investments and move the funds overseas, in the belief they will be safer there. Her market of choice is the US, where she now holds a healthy portfolio of stocks and funds, all denominated in US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves hit a seven-month high[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2097339/chinas-forex-reserves-hit-seven-month-high]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The desire among China's wealthy to convert their yuan-based assets into foreign currencies has been a headache for Beijing. But despite its efforts to curb capital outflows, the problem has become one of the "grey rhino" risks to the economy that are considered too big to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose for a sixth straight month in July, suggesting Beijing's efforts to slow capital outflows and boost inflows were paying dividends. However, an economist said the growth in the figures should not be overplayed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rise in foreign exchange reserves is partly a result of currency valuation changes in the portfolio," said Wang Tao, chief China economist with </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">. "A rise in reserves doesn't mean a net capital inflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the government does not release the currency structure of its reserve portfolio, it is generally estimated that the US dollar accounts for about two thirds of the US$3 trillion stockpile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China to maintain tight rein on capital outflows despite gains in forex reserves[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/2101975/china-maintain-tight-rein-capital-outflows-despite-gains]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to a weakening greenback, the yuan has gained steadily against the US dollar this year. The movement is also likely to have led to an appreciation in assets dominated in euros and yen, resulting in a nominal rise in the nation's foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xie Yaxuan, chief economist with China Merchants Securities, estimated that the valuation change contributed to a nominal rise of US$29.1 billion in July, which in effect means China's reserves fell by US$5.2 billion in the month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similarly, if measured by the Special Drawing Rights - the accounting unit used by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> - China's reserves have fallen in each of the past five months, from 2.2196 trillion SDR at the end of February to 2.1884 trillion at the end of July, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China eases yuan outflow controls in sign of recovered confidence[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2088772/china-eases-yuan-outflow-controls-sign-recovered-confidence]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another measure of capital flow, namely yuan positions resulting from foreign exchange purchases, has been in decline for 21 months, indicating a steady capital outflow. The better news for Beijing is that the fall in July was only 4.6 billion yuan, down from 34.3 billion in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite disciplining some of the country's big global deal makers, including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, earlier in the year for their lavish overseas spending, the government still has a long way to go to stem the outward flow of investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Zhengwei, chief economist with Industrial Bank in Shanghai, said the outflow pressure in the second half of 2017 "will be bigger than the first half".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Yu Yongding, an outspoken economist with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"> and a former adviser to the central bank, said that China has been facing serious capital flight for years and that the chronic problem is unlikely to go away any time soon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang certainly has no plans to stop moving her money out of the country. She even hinted at ways to bypass the limit of US$50,000 worth of foreign currency that Chinese citizens are allowed to buy each year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If a further 60 million Chinese thought like her, and each exercised their right to purchase exchange their maximum allowance of foreign currency, China's US$3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves would be wiped out overnight.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first half of 2017 has not been particularly kind to Country Garden [http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2103321/country-garden-sells-bonds-beijing-relaxes-fund-raising], the Chinese property developer behind the US$100 billion metropolis being built in a special Malaysian economic zone bordering Singapore [http://www.scmp.com/topics/singapore] that is dubbed the "next Shenzhen".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong-listed developer building the sprawling Forest City development found itself at the centre of a political feud in January when the top government critic Mahathir Mohamad launched a blistering online campaign against it to ram home attacks against Prime Minister Najib Razak [http://www.scmp.com/author/najib-razak] for embracing China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese home builder's troubles then deepened in March when Beijing unleashed aggressive measures to clamp down on capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That meant Country Garden - China's third-largest developer - had to reconfigure a home market-focused sales policy that had seen some 70 per cent of its early Forest City sales snapped up by Chinese nationals. Now, as the unflattering headlines ebb away, the company is stepping up efforts to show it has come out of the tumultuous six months unscathed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu Runze, its top Malaysia-based executive overseeing the Forest City project, told This Week in Asia in e-mailed comments that "the project is progressing very smoothly, as planned".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But independent industry observers say the project's use as a political bogeyman by Mahathir, coupled with weakened sales due to the capital clampdown in China, means significant hurdles remain for Forest City, billed by Country Garden as "a dream paradise for all mankind".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its first tranche of flats are due to be ready next year, but the 1,400-hectare project will not be completed until 2035.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the company made a slew of announcements, including the unveiling of plans for a traditional Chinese medicine hospital and an upgrade of a massive in-house prefabrication facility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And among 21 new business agreements inked on Friday was a tie-up with Hong Kong telecoms company PCCW for data centre services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu said the new deals emphasised just how Malaysia and the Iskandar development region - where Forest City is sited - stood to gain from the private-property venture.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Iskandar zone is three times the size of Hong Kong and has drawn in billions of dollars of investments since its launch in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We understand the scale of our project has drawn attention from many quarters, including the opposition," Yu said in the e-mailed comments. But it was "simplistic to view Forest City as just a Chinese project", said Yu, president and chief strategy officer at Country Garden Pacificview, the Malaysian holding company behind Forest City.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Ultimately, we just focus our efforts on doing what we do best - developing a township and in Forest City's case, a futuristic urban model of what future metropolises would look like," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu added the company focused on "those who support us", naming the Malaysian government as well as the monarchy and local government of the Johor province - which has purview over the Iskandar region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mahathir's attacks on Forest City - on his popular blog chedet.cc and in comments to the media - has centred around the government's decision to grant the development freehold status.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The acid-tongued leader - premier from 1981 to 2004 - characterised Forest City as a carve-out of Malaysian land to China. Last year, he quit Najib's National Front coalition of which he had been part of for decades, citing a loss of confidence in the premier over his handling of the multibillion dollar graft scandal at the state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) [http://www.scmp.com/topics/malaysia-1mdb-scandal].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He joined hands with the opposition, which has made Najib's acceptance of hundreds of billions of ringgit worth of Chinese investment one of its key gripes with the current administration. Mahathir and other government critics say the pro-Beijing tilt could hurt Malaysia's sovereignty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an interview with T his Week in Asia in March, Mahathir said Forest City was "not a Chinese investment, but a settlement".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Once you buy land, then you gain control over that piece of land. That is different from FDI [foreign direct investment]. It's going to be their own city where they are going to have their own shops, their own banks, their own everything."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mahathir's criticism of the project drew sharp rebukes not only from Najib, but from Ibrahim Ismail, the influential Johor Sultan, who slammed the former leader for "putting political interests above Malaysian interests". The constitutional monarch accused Mahathir of "creating fear, using race, just to fulfil his political motives".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Company records seen by This Week in Asia showed Ibrahim had an indirect 25.6 per cent stake in the Malaysian-domiciled Country Garden Pacificview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese developer had a 58.2 per cent stake, while the Johor state government held eight per cent of equity. Mahathir's acerbic attacks on Forest City have ebbed away in recent months, in part because he wanted to avoid provoking the popular monarch further ahead of impending polls, some observers say. There is some speculation Najib might call a snap election in the coming months, even though the current electoral term does not end until August 2018. The state of Johor - with millions of rural Malay voters who revere Mahathir - is seen as crucial for the opposition to snatch victory at the ballot box.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I thought it was unwise for the opposition to have attacked the Forest City project as it indirectly criticised the Johor royalty who still command respect and influence among the electorate in the state," said Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a Malaysia-based analyst with the BowerGroupAsia political risk consultancy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is even more so as the two main states that Mahathir's [party] is targeting are Johor and Kedah," Asrul said. Oh Ei Sun, another veteran Malaysian politics watcher, said the opposition's criticism of Forest City had died down in recent months "due to China's capital outflow controls", which had dampened sales to Chinese nationals. "There is no point to criticise any more."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing the tightened restrictions on capital outflows, Yu said the market might have overreacted "before calming down and taking stock of the situation".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the continued opening up of the Chinese economy and Chinese companies, there is an increased demand for cross-border trade settlement in China's yuan currency," Yu said. He added: "We believe the Chinese government will approach this matter in a fair and pragmatic manner that will benefit all." He did not directly address whether sales had been hurt, but in March, Country Garden temporarily shut its mainland showrooms promoting Forest City, citing the need to "better fit with current foreign exchange policies and regulations".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The showrooms reopened later in the month, highlighting projects on Chinese shores. The company also pledged to refund money to dozens of investors caught up by the crackdown on capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has opened new showrooms across Southeast Asia, South Asia and elsewhere to draw in international buyers. Sigrid Zialcita, an Asia-Pacific property market expert, said "the strategy to widen the project's potential buyer base to the Middle East, South Asia as well as here in Southeast Asia is viable and probably long overdue".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zialcita, the Asia-Pacific head of research at real estate brokerage </span><span class="s3">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span><span class="s1">, said the current restrictions were likely to be "transitory" as they would put Chinese firms at a competitive disadvantage if they remained in place in the long term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before the guillotine on capital outflows came down, the developer sold some 17,000 units in Forest City worth US$2.9 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Veena Loh, a Malaysia-based research director at the real estate services firm JLL, said in the long term, Forest City remained an attractive destination for affluent Chinese property investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital outflow controls "hasn't altered the fact the wealth will continue to move around the globe to places where there is greater return."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The wealthier Chinese who have been investing overseas have probably been investing in assets in developed countries like the US and Europe many years ago before Forest City was launched," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She added: "Should these investors feel that there is better growth in Asia compared to the West, they may liquidate some of their assets overseas to invest here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But to continue to tap this well of deep-pocketed Chinese investors, Forest City has to make sure the project is "planned and developed in accordance to the annual demand," she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> stepped in on Sunday night to provide “forward guidance” support for the Chinese currency by talking up the yuan against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an apparent move to ease market concerns over weakening of the yuan and capital flight from China, Yi Gang, a deputy governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said in an interview with </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> that prospects for the US dollar are uncertain but the yuan is a “stable and strong” currency and its depreciation against the dollar was less than that of the Japanese yen or the euro.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi's comments indicated the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> might intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the yuan before the dollar-yuan rate broke the key level of 7, as rapid depreciation of the yuan and capital exodus could mutually reinforce each other, analysts said. China has already burnt through more than US$800 billion of forex reserves in the past two years to prevent a free fall of the yuan exchange rate.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yi's comments were set to call for market rationality, trying to persuade market participants not to rush to the US dollar,” said Tan Yaling, head of the China Forex Investment Research Institute.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In case the market didn't listen, the central bank was ready to upgrade its capital account control in “a flexible and dynamic way”, Tan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A rally in value of the US dollar has been widely attributed to the recent weakening of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi, the central bank official, was quoted as saying the yuan's weakening was not a problem with China but a result of “Trump's win in the US presidential election, higher expectations on the Fed to raise interest rates, Britain's decision to leave the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> as and the free floating Egyptian pound”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But the prospects for the US dollar have uncertainties, and it can't be ruled out that the dollar will retreat if market expectations are corrected,” Yi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese yuan strengthens against US dollar after record-low levels last week[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2049724/chinese-yuan-strengthens-against-us-dollar-after]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen Jianguang, chief economist of Mizuho Securities Asia, said Yi could have a point, and China would be able to keep the exchange rate around 7 for the remainder of this year and 7.3 until the end of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China has lots of ‘soft constraints' to control the speed of capital outflow, such as instructions on enterprises and scrutiny over individuals' needs,” Shen said. “Outbound investment in property or other purely financial investment could also be strictly reviewed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-border mergers and acquisitions are major means of capital outflow. Outbound investment reached US$134.2 billion in the first three quarters, compared to US$95.1 billion of foreign direct investment in the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said the exchange rate of 7 yuan to the dollar was a key “intervention” yardstick.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Policymakers will not shy away from further tightening capital account restrictions if needed. They could also take lower-profile steps such as slowing down state-owned enterprise's outbound investment and banks' overseas lending,” Kuijs wrote in a research note on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heng Koon How, senior forex strategist at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> in Singapore, said: “Yi Gang's words signal that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> may think the yuan has had too much weakening in the short term, and some consolidation is needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's time for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to make moves to stabilise the yuan and it is likely to maintain the yuan around 6.9 per US dollar at least until the (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting mid December,” Heng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China also has the capability to slow the pace of depreciation if necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is China's dream to make yuan an alternative to the US dollar now falling apart?[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2049450/chinas-dream-make-yuan-alternative-us-dollar-now-falling-apart]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves fell US$45.6 billion in October when yuan depreciation accelerated, but analysts largely attributed that to value changes in the dollar against other currencies, rather than an absolute fall. The size of the monthly fall was also much lower than the largest drop of US$108 billion recorded in December 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will take three years for China's forex reserves to fall to US$2 trillion according to the current pace, while there will be huge uncertainties over the trend of the US dollar index in that period,” Shen Jianguang forecast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike the panic over uncertainties in the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> reform late last year, the market is generally stable given the relatively transparent exchange rate mechanism and the idea of managed depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The good performance of the domestic stock market indicates that such forex fluctuations have largely been ignored,” said Liu Dongliang, a senior forex analyst with </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1"> in Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is unlikely to set a bottom line for intervention since that is against the market-oriented reform, but it may step in to support the currency at key psychological levels,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is poised to hold steady against the US dollar in May as the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> shrugs off market pressure to devalue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say Beijing has a deliberate strategy for reforming the country's economy and capital account system and a stable exchange rate works in the government's interest for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We don't think the currency moves much lower from here," said Brett McGonegal, head of investment firm Reorient Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On all 21 trading days last month, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the mid price, a fixed price issued at 9.15am around which the yuan can trade up or down 2 per cent daily, above the onshore yuan's closing price the day before. The goal seemed clear: to arrest downward pressure on the yuan. The currency finished the month 0.12 per cent up against the greenback, and the yuan has strengthened 4 per cent this year on a trade-weighted basis, according to a </span><span class="s3">Rabobank</span><span class="s1"> report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The trend is the market wants the renminbi to depreciate," said William Mo, marketing vice-president at Tung Shing Securities. But real pressure on the yuan would only begin once US interest rates started rising, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While a weaker yuan would help mainland exporters, it might equally trigger capital outflow and weaken the impetus for domestic reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For now the central authorities are using other tools to boost the economy, including cuts to bank reserve requirements. "It is crucial to understand that monetary easing is not a sign that policymakers are purposely trying to weaken the renminbi to stimulate exports and growth," </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> analysts wrote in a recent report. "China's leaders have repeatedly committed to keeping the external value of the renminbi broadly stable, despite domestic economic challenges." One reason is fear of a sudden capital outflow should yuan holders think the government will let the currency weaken.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another reason was stability while capital account reforms are put in place, McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is a huge change, a pivot from China being this closed economy with a currency that is not deliverable and now into a modern-day free-flowing capital account," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This process is still far from over, and no fixed end date exists. Nevertheless, McGonegal said, yesterday's launch of a mainland bank deposit insurance scheme and this autumn's rollout of a yuan global settlement programme known as the China International Payment System were important steps towards liberalisation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A market repricing of the risk of tightening by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> weighed heavily on Chinese shares last week, which could persist through mid-June as fears loom large of a possible currency devaluation and capital outflows as a result of the Fed move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, A shares extended their losing streak to a fifth straight week, mainly due to the hawkish tone in the Fed minutes that revived expectations of an interest rate rise next month. Concerns over monetary tightening have also driven the US dollar index to a seven-week high while the Chinese yuan has fallen to an 11-week low against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Brace for turbulence," said Frederic Neumann, an economist at HSBC. "The Fed is back in play. And when it moves, markets in Asia will feel the ripple."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts mull the effects of possible Fed hike on yuan, China equities[https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/1947969/analysts-mull-effects-possible-fed-hike-yuan-china-equities]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said any tweaks to the US central bank's policy stance will reverberate across the region and affect the financial markets, as concerns over a Fed tightening will likely impact the US dollar and cause volatility in the Chinese currency. It may also weigh on oil prices and trigger worries about the energy sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar factors rattled Asian markets in January, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After all the fury in January, Asian markets did rather well with the return of the ‘stabilisation trade'. But fundamentally, little has changed. Local demand is still highly credit-dependent and exports wobbly," Neumann said, noting that the growth prospect for China has turned gloomier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the Chinese markets, caution has prevailed due to worries over both further Fed tightening and sluggish growth of China's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weekly turnover in Shanghai markets touched a seven-month low of 664 billion yuan last week. The balance of margin loans and securities lending also shrank to 825 billion yuan by Friday, the lowest since late November 2014.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors lack the conviction to act," said Larry Hu, an analyst for Macquarie Group, adding that sentiment has been dampened by a number of macro uncertainties, including slower-than-expected growth of the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US Fed signals strongly interest rate hike on the table in June[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1947201/us-fed-signals-strongly-interest-rate-hike-table-june]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Going forward, it's hard for stocks to stage a solid rebound in the short term, as the market is dominated by a risk-off sentiment, with rising expectations of a US rate hike and new macro uncertainties," said Zhang Ge, an analyst at Citic Securities Futures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that there is no "significant improvement" in fundamentals, with no sustained signs of a strong recovery in the Chinese economy and the central bank showing less appetite for strong monetary stimulus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides, the possibility of a Fed rate rise has also fuelled expectations of a weakening in the Chinese currency and faster capital outflows from China, which may cause volatility in asset markets, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By Friday, yuan's reference rate against the US dollar had fallen 1.4 per cent from the end of April. Onshore yuan had also fallen 0.9 per cent during the same time while offshore yuan had weakened 1.2 per cent. The spread between onshore and offshore yuan widened up to 400 pips in mid-May, compared with 100 pips at the end of April, indicating mounting depreciation pressure on the yuan in overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Down the road, if the dollar index returns to 100 (currently at 95), the RMB against dollar could depreciate to 6.8," said analysts from </span><span class="s3">Macquarie Group</span><span class="s1"> in a recent research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They warned against a scenario in which a stronger dollar will lead to a weaker yuan and higher capital outflows from emerging markets, resulting in lower risk appetite and rising market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflows from China persisted in April. The country's commercial banks sold net foreign exchange of US$24.7 billion in April, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> reported recently. Although April's figures showed the pace of capital outflow slowed from March - with net sales of US$36.4 billion - the pressure could easily return as the dollar has gained momentum, analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"People have every reason to believe China is facing bigger capital outflow pressures due to the continued depreciation in the Chinese yuan in May, " said Song Yiwei, an analyst at Bohai Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For A shares, the fundamentals are unfavourable and the liquidity stress could deteriorate," he noted, advising investors to stay on the sidelines and wait till the end of the market repricing of the current risk factors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neumann from </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> also cautioned that investors may have to get ready for a more volatile summer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With little fundamental improvement, asset markets may turn out to be more brittle than the last</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's plan to introduce a new tax to combat currency speculation is likely to hit the yuan's internationalisation, say analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan fell by the most in a month last week after Bloomberg reported that Beijing was considering introducing a Tobin tax to curb currency speculation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">People's Bank of China deputy governor Yi Gang said such a tax was still "an academic subject". In October, he had said the authorities were looking at ways to curb currency speculation, including a Tobin tax.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The possibility of such a tax led the yuan to fall early last week by 0.59 per cent, before it rebounded on Thursday following the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s decision to hold rates and slow down the pace of rate hikes this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tax was first proposed by Nobel laureate James Tobin in 1972, from whom it gets the name.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Jones, partner and tax expert at law firm Eversheds, said past experience shows such a tax would have a negative effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Tobin taxes have had a chequered past, with powerful examples of unintended market disruption and genuine concerns about how such a tax can be effectively operated in a global economy," Jones said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Sweden's experiment with a Tobin tax in the 1980s ended disastrously, with significant trading activity moving from Sweden to other markets. More recently, attempts by the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have floundered, a key problem being the design of an effective system that discourages migration from the market while avoiding extra-territorial taxation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jones said that since yuan trading in China is different from other markets, such a tax would have the desired effect of dampening yuan speculation. "However, history has shown that the knock-on effects of such a tax can be significant and unexpected, and the legal and administrative framework of such taxes are often complex and burdensome. Ultimately, both outcomes are likely to create a more challenging business environment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allan Chiang, dealing director at Tung Shing Securities, said it is possible Beijing would go ahead with such a tax plan as it wants to ensure currency stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beijing wants the yuan to become an international currency and be market-driven. However, the conditions in China are not suitable for a freely traded yuan. Since the one-off devaluation in August, the yuan has fallen substantially against the US dollar while there have been lots of speculative activities and capital outflow," Chiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These have prompted concerns about speculative activities, and Beijing would try introduce all types of measures including Tobin tax to drive away speculators."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan fell 2 per cent in the first week of this year, after depreciating 5.6 per cent over last year against the US dollar amid concerns over an economic slowdown and expectations of interest rate rises in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was only after the market intervention by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> in mid-January and the weakening of the US dollar against other currencies since February that yuan has bounced back. As of Monday, offshore yuan had risen 1.32 per cent against the US dollar while onshore yuan was up 0.11 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's 0.67 per cent rise against the US dollar in February helped arresting China's foreign reserves decline to US$29 billion. That compares with a US$99 billion drop in January, when the yuan depreciated 0.38 per cent. In December, foreign reserves dropped US$ 108 billion drop when the yuan depreciated by 2.26 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is a strong relationship between capital outflow and drops in forex reserves with the yuan rate. Beijing has to worry about capital outflows and decline of the foreign reserves. It would prefer to see a slower pace for the internationalisation of the yuan instead of a rapid falling of the yuan," Chiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Bank executive director Andrew Fung, said Beijing only wants to use a Tobin tax as a standby measure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Central banks around the world carry out measures to defend their currencies. China is no exception, and would use all measures including the tax to achieve such a purpose. However, China will only use it in extreme situations when currency speculators seriously attack the yuan," Fung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should give top priority to domestic economic growth rather than defending the yuan exchange rate, says a former senior official with China's foreign exchange regulator, in a fresh sign that Beijing is willing to tolerate further fluctuation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If there is conflict between growth and exchange rates, China's monetary policy should give priority to growth,” Guan Tao, a former departmental head of the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, said in an interview with the official China Securities Journal published on Monday.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guan, who was director general of the balance of payments department of the top forex regulator from 2009 to 2015 and is now a researcher on the Chinese economy and exchange rate policy, said Beijing is now using a trio of policies to handle capital outflow and yuan depreciation. These are to set the yuan exchange rate against a basket of currencies, conduct modest interventions in the foreign exchange market and impose capital account control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves fall more than expected in September, by US$18.8b[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/2025979/chinas-forex-reserves-fall-more-expected-september-us188b]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is an impossible mission for Beijing to keep the yuan exchange rate stable and also maintain the size of its foreign exchange reserves, Guan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's official foreign exchange reserves shrank US$800 billion during the past two years and the world's largest stockpile of foreign exchange is melting at an alarming rate, especially after China shocked the world by devaluing the yuan by 2 per cent in August 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities are getting increasingly harsh on capital outflow by imposing added restrictions. In the latest move, </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> announced on Saturday that its cards issued in mainland China could no longer be used to pay premiums on investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Jian, a Bank of Communications senior researcher in Shanghai, said China's monetary policy is always the result of complex internal and external issues and has a different focus at different times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Avoiding risks stands out as the policy focus at this stage and we think the authorities will be more tolerant of the yuan's fall,” Liu said. “However, we don't think that means a free fall of the yuan - they are just showing a growing confidence in guiding the yuan's expected depreciation, at a pace they think is still within their control.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PBOC sets yuan fixing at six-year low amid renewed depreciation pressure[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2026645/pboc-sets-yuan-fixing-67008-lowest-level-six-years]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A wilder fluctuation of the yuan rate is also projected. The central bank on Monday set the central parity rate of the yuan at 6.7641 against the greenback, up 0.32 per cent from Friday, in the biggest increase in more than a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Qu, an ANZ Bank economist in Shanghai, said China still faced mounting outflow pressure, which could weigh on the yuan exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The problem now is not whether the yuan will fall or not, but how much it will decrease,” Qu said. “Now the market is closely looking at the currency to see if it will break the 6.83 level, which was the exchange rate held after the 2008 financial crisis,” Qu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that yuan depreciation pressure could resume at year end and early next year on rising expectation of a </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> interest rate hike in December and the opening of the annual forex quota of US$50,000 for individuals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Communist Party Politburo vowed on Friday to keep existing economic policies in place to ensure stable economic growth for the rest of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The meeting, which came after the close of the Central Committee's sixth plenum, called for “reasonable” fiscal expenditure as part of proactive fiscal policy, and sufficient liquidity in a prudent monetary policy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar fell for the fifth day in a row on Wednesday morning to 7.8226, the lowest level since August 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock market slump, the weak economy and the US interest rate rise have led to capital outflow, causing the local currency to fall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar hit 7.8226 against the US dollar early on Wednesday morning before bouncing back slightly to 7.8218 at 9.45am. The local currency has fallen 0.79 per cent over past five trading days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo Cho-yan, director of Tung Shing Futures, said it would continue to fall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no sign of bounce back of the Hong Kong dollar," he said. "Traders believe the capital outflow from the city will continue due to the weak economy and stock market sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong dollar may well touch 7.83 later today; then it should have some technical support trading ... it may well hit the weak end of the peg at 7.85 and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will need to intervene then."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is now trading at the weakest level since the subprime crisis emerged at the beginning of the global financial crisis. The last time the HKMA had to intervene to keep the Hong Kong dollar from falling beyond the 7.85 weak end of the peg was in December 2005.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar turned stronger from 2009 due to the monetary easing policy in the United States and Europe that led to a US$130 billion inflow to the city that propped up the stock and property markets. Between 2009 and last year the HKMA had to intervene many times to prevent the currency from becoming too strong, but now it has to prevent it from becoming too weak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan continue to fall on Wednesday morning, trading at 6.5999 at 9.45am, down 0.15 per cent from Tuesday when it was weaker by 0.13 per cent after a strong gain of 0.5 per cent on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the offshore yuan has been relatively stable this week after intervention by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> last week saw it bounce back 1 per cent after depreciating by 1.72 per cent the previous week. The currency is now trading at a level similar to the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan was unchanged, trading at 6.5784. The currency gained 0.01 per cent on Tuesday and 0.08 per cent on Monday after a gain of 0.14 per cent last week, following depreciation of 1.56 per cent the previous week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spread between onshore and offshore yuan has narrowed to 275 basis points, down from a record 1,400 basis points on January 7.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan mid-price against the US dollar at 6.5578 on Wednesday morning, 18 basis points stronger than on Tuesday, when it set the mid-price 6 basis points weaker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It set the mid-price against the euro weaker by 140 basis points to 7.1627, and for every 100 yen stronger by 50 basis points at 5.5834. The mid-price against the pound was set 653 basis points stronger at 9.2987.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent either side of the mid-price for the day.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China pursues its own economic policies through a combination of lower interest rates and reduced reserve requirement ratios, there may be undesired cross-border spillovers that affect the United States - even as the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> ponders its own monetary policy path.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China and the US, "the two 800-pound gorillas" of the global economy as they were recently described by Todd Stern, the US special envoy for climate change, are inextricably linked economically and monetarily.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the global financial crisis, many emerging-market policymakers complained the US was exporting deflation as the Fed's quantitative easing policies led investors to seek better returns elsewhere, leaving the US dollar weaker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lower dollar, by definition, meant other currencies strengthened, and those stronger currencies could buy dollar-denominated imports, such as energy or US exports, more cheaply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the US central bank would no doubt contest the deflation-exporting charge, the Fed was not simultaneously managing a mountain of foreign-currency-denominated reserves. Unlike the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's predicament is that its economic growth slowed to 7 per cent in the first quarter from 7.4 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some economists doubt if this year's targeted 7 per cent growth is attainable, especially as exports fell 6.4 per cent last month following a 15 per cent drop in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, deflation fears have risen with producer prices dropping 4.6 per cent last month, the 37th consecutive month of falls, and with consumer price inflation at only 1.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against this backdrop, Beijing reduced interest rates on May 10 - the third time in six months - seeking to re-energise the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> lowered the one-year benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.1 per cent, while dropping the deposit rate by the same amount to 2.25 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lower rates, by eroding the yield differential between China and the US, could prompt some capital outflow, leading to yuan sales and dollar buying, which also has the impact of making yuan-denominated exports cheaper in foreign-currency terms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> smooths such outflow-induced yuan weakness by selling dollars for yuan, it draws down its foreign-exchange reserves, much of it held in US treasuries. This might, by extension, have some downward influence on treasury prices with a corresponding upward impact on yields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paradoxically, such a sequence of events could further erode the yield differential and encourage more yuan-negative capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Either way, lower </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> interest rates could, to some extent, make Chinese exports more competitive and thus export deflation to those that buy Chinese goods.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is also Beijing's decision to cut the reserve ratio, the minimum amount of money lenders must keep with the central bank, by 100 basis points to 18.5 per centon April 19, freeing up about 1.3 trillion yuan for new lending, but with an impact on the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Printing more yuan, replacing one balance-sheet liability for another, would provide the money to be returned, but such a large boost to the money supply could weigh on the yuan's value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would also leave Beijing open to the accusation of exporting inflation, but it might also make investors restive, again necessitating </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> smoothing of movements in the dollar-yuan exchange rate, and again involving sales of dollars for yuan with the same potential negative implications for treasury prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Equally, selling down reserves alone, predominantly dollar-denominated, to generate yuan to fund the reserves cut could have similar consequences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That reserves drawdown is already evident.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The drop in Beijing's foreign-currency reserves in the first three months of the year was the largest quarterly fall on record, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> said. That may partly explain the increase in </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> bond yields in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ripple effects of Beijing's monetary policy settings may result in some export of deflation from China to the US at the same time as the drawdown on Chinese reserves puts some upward pressure on US yields even without the Fed officially raising rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If so, that is an 800-pound gorilla in the room for the Fed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves, once the pride of the nation's policymakers and citizens, may continue shrinking in 2017, as a yearlong capital outflow shows no sign of abating. That may exert pressure on the government to tighten the screws on remittances of the yuan to stabilize the currency, analysts and economists say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese foreign exchange reserves shrank by about a quarter from US$3.99 trillion in June 2014 to US$3.05 trillion as of November, and the country was displaced in October by Japan as America's top foreign creditor, as the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> spent more of its reserves to defend the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China must "safeguard the foreign reserve pool" as this is a higher priority than propping up the yuan's exchange rate, best left to market forces, said Yu Yongding, a Chinese Academy of Social Sciences professor and a former adviser to the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key issue is the foreign reserve," Yu said. "If we keep guarding the currency rate, the reserve drops, and when it drops to an inadequate level, we will face even bigger depreciation pressure for the currency," he said.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's US Treasuries holdings fell to US$1.12 trillion at the end of October, slightly less than the US$1.13 trillion held by Japan, losing the crown of being America's largest foreign creditor for the first time in six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Money is leaving China's shores at a faster clip, as more citizens and companies rush to get their currency out of the country before the yuan's value deteriorates faster.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily turnover of China's foreign exchange market reached US$34.2 billion as of December 19, 12 per cent more than the US$30.5 billion daily average in November, according to research by investment bank </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> (CICC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Expectations for a strengthened US dollar is dominating the markets and sentiments in China, making it particularly difficult for decision makers to handle," said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers Asia. "For them, the current imperative is to stabilise outflows through tighter capital control. Although it doesn't seem like a sustainable solution, it can win time and space for the government to manage the situation as domestic and exterior condition evolves."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market watchers warn of yuan depreciation[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2011589/market-watchers-warn-yuan-depreciation]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's government may further enhance the administrative measures at its disposal, or "asymmetric capital account management measures" in financial jargon, to make currency inflows easier while outflows become harder, Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The management of portfolio flows, mainly investments in equities and bonds, will be stricter than direct investment control," Yao said. "Companies eyeing non-core business acquisition overseas will definitely meet bigger obstacles."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The "errors and omissions" entry in Chinese national account statistics, a catch-all for cross border transfers that haven't been properly classified, caused net outflows of US$89 billion in the first half of this year, almost double the US$46 billion net foreign direct investment outflows in the same period. This suggests there are loopholes in China's capital account system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government is likely to "throw sand in the gears" and create friction in capital remittances such as scrapping or adjusting the annual US$50,000 individual foreign exchange swap quota, CICC analysts said, instead of imposing hardline capital controls.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves are adequate and won't be a threat to external payments as long as they remain above US$2.6 trillion, CICC said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We don't rule out the possibility of some window guidance at the bank level, or even requiring additional documentary proof for foreign exchange purchases," CICC said. Window guidance is a form of moral suasion by the central bank, which doesn't require across-the-board policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A reserve level higher than US$2.6 trillion would've met all the traditional adequacy standards, including 3-month import coverage (US$420 billion), the size of debt coverage (US$921 billion), and the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s composite metric (US$1.7 trillion to 2.6 trillion)," CICC said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's strict restrictions on outbound direct investments and yuan flows could mitigate the pressure of outflows and help the yuan avoid near-term volatility, albeit at the cost of delaying or cancelling Chinese firms' overseas investment deals, and slowing the pace of financial liberalisation and yuan internationalisation, Morgan Stanely said last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fundamental reason for the yuan's outflow, caused by a "decline in investment returns and lower real rates in China while the US enters the rate increase cycle" will likely keep capital outflow pressures alive in the medium term and drive the yuan weaker, the bank said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan weakened further on Friday morning but the currency is still poised to post its strongest weekly gain since October after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s aggressive intervention earlier this week to raise borrowing yuan costs in order to drive away currency speculators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan traded lower for the second day in a row and was at 6.6160 against the US dollar at 11.30am, weaker by 0.24 per cent, after a fall of 0.53 per cent on Thursday when the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> stopped its intervention, currency traders said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a weekly basis, however, the currency traded by international investors in Hong Kong was still up 1 per cent after this morning's trade, the strongest weekly gain since October, and a sharp turnaround from a fall of 1.72 per cent last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has no longer intervened in the offshore yuan market over the past two days and the interest rate for the currency has fallen as a result. This has led traders back to sell the currency," said Jasper Lo Cho-yan, a director of Tung Shing Futures.The PBOC has burnt the fingers of some speculators but they will not end the gameJasper Lo Cho-yan, Tung Shing Futures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has burnt the fingers of some speculators but they will not end the game. They will test the market sometime next week. The trend is the yuan will continue to fall unless the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> intervenes again. The central bank will not always intervene but it will definitely act again when the yuan falls too sharply."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The intervention, which saw the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> ask mainland-based banks not to sell any yuan and only buy the currency in the market, dried up liquidity. This raised yuan borrowing costs in the offshore yuan interbank market - CNH Hibor - which shot up to a record 200 per cent for overnight funding on Tuesday afternoon before falling back to 8 per cent on Wednesday. They were fixed at 2.10 per cent on Friday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other short-term rates remain high, however, with the one-week rate fixed at 8.2080, one-month at 9.3240, and three-month at 8.4755.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan traded in Shanghai rose 0.03 per cent to 6.5866, 294 basis points stronger than the offshore yuan, after setting a record discount of 1,400 basis points last week. On a weekly basis, the onshore yuan has risen 0.1 per cent this week, compared with a fall of 1.56 per cent last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the mid-price of the yuan against the US dollar at 6.5637, weaker by 21 basis points. On Thursday it set the yuan mid-price 14 basis points stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It set the mid-price against the euro stronger by 71 basis points at 7.1397 on Friday and the mid-price against every 100 yen stronger by 196 basis points at 5.5661. The mid-price agains the pound was set 253 basis points weaker at 9.4862.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent either side of the mid-price for the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> report on Friday said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> might tighthen capital controls to prevent capital outflow and further yuan depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Market sentiment will potentially deteriorate further if the drop in official FX reserves accelerates to beyond US$100 billion per month, as seen from recent months. However, we believe when market confidence is destabilised, policymakers will likely consider raising capital control more significantly to slow down capital outflow," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One potential restriction would be tightening up on mainland individuals entitlement purchase US$50,000 a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> might consider tightening related individual FX purchase policies as a part of its macro prudential measures under special circumstances," the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland has relaxed foreign investment restrictions in its once-sizzling real estate market as worries mount on capital flight in the wake of a weakening yuan and slowing economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six governing ministries, including the central bank and the commerce ministry, issued a statement scrapping previous rules that required foreign property investors to pay the full amount of registered capital for their mainland entities to mainland authorities before borrowing any loans or applying for foreign exchange transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The move seems to be aimed at discouraging capital outflow after the devaluation of the yuan," said Alan Chiang, head of residential in the Greater China region for global property consultancy DTZ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The move will offer an alternative for foreign corporates to invest if the government decides to stop the capital outflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But as concerns about the mainland stock market and the yuan linger, many industry analysts wonder if such incremental policy relaxations will help.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland drew 18.5 billion yuan (HK$22.3 billion) of foreign investment in the real estate sector in the first seven months of this year, down 24.5 per cent from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The first half saw a year-on-year drop of 3.9 per cent, indicating a steep decline in July. Foreign capital accounts for less than 1 per cent of total real estate investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statement said foreigners working or living in the mainland could buy homes in the country for self-use but purchases should adhere to specific rules in the cities they are buying. The same applied to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the housing market cracked under a glut early last year, some mainland cities have been relaxing rules requiring foreigners to have been in the mainland for at least a year before becoming eligible to buy a local home, but only one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The latest rule is an endorsement of such loosening," said Lillian Duan, a Shanghai-based partner at global law firm </span><span class="s3">DLA Piper</span><span class="s1">, adding that foreigners who were not in the mainland or wanted to buy more than one home in the country may still need special certification.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has restricted foreign investment in the real estate sector since 2006 but after last year's market correction, the authorities began to quicken the pace of policy relaxations to treat property the same way as any sector vis-a-vis foreign direct investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Steven McCord, North China head of research of consultancy JLL in Beijing, said: "This is a carefully measured step that is happening at the right time to add a small boost to market demand."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A bid led by private Chinese company Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group to take a 49.5 per cent stake in the parent of the </span><span class="s3">Chicago Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (CHX) is now unlikely to go ahead given stricter capital controls implemented by Beijing and existing strong opposition from US lawmakers, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investors would own 49.5 per cent of the bourse after the proposed purchase, while the combined voting power of two key investors will be limited to 20 per cent, according to a filing posted on the CHX website on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal comes at an uneasy time as Beijing moves to tighten capital controls to curb the scale of overseas investments in order to cushion the sharp depreciation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting Monday, all overseas payments under the capital account made through commercial banks in Shanghai that exceed US$5 million[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2050029/chinas-foreign-investment-shopping-spree-over-beijing-moves-slash] have to be submitted to Beijing for special clearance before proceeding, banking sources told the Post.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My guess is it will be very difficult for them to get approval. The Chinese government is cracking down on capital outflow... particularly on companies that are buying assets offshore that are not in their core areas of expertise,” said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Too many real estate and other firms are buying assets that they know nothing about and clearly this is viewed as a way to transfer yuan out and evade capital controls,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zheng Zhigang, professor of finance with </span><span class="s3">Renmin University of China</span><span class="s1"> in Beijing, said; “Taking up a US stock exchange is in accordance with the national strategy that encourages companies to go global, but controversially, it is indeed capital outflow...furthermore, the bourse business is not related to the core business of the acquirer.”There is good cash flow and if the equity markets do better then there is a lot of money to be madeShaun Rein, China Market Research</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group is a privately held holding company, based in Chongqing, with investments in real estate, environmental protection and financial firms. It controls Shenzhen listed Casin Guoxing Property Development Co Ltd.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the CHX filing, Jay Lu, a US citizen and his father, Shengju Lu, Chongqing Caisin's majority shareholder, would see their combined voting power limited to 20 per cent of the exchange owners' shares, according to exchange ownership limits, even though they would jointly own 39.5 per cent of the holding company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investor group, including several other Chinese companies, and individuals and companies in the US, would own 100 per cent of the outstanding stock of CHX after the transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, special rules regarding the makeup of the board of directors of a self-regulatory organisation will apply to the CHX. These rules “specify that a majority of the board must be made up of directors that are not from the securities industry and do not own or otherwise have a material relationship with the exchange”, the filing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the updated information about the deal was meant to ease concerns raised by US lawmakers in February when the planned sale was announced, about Chinese companies taking control of the US bourse and gaining access to confidential information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Chinese have been looking to buy into the Chicago bourse for quite a while now,” said Rein. “There is good cash flow and if the equity markets do better then there is a lot of money to be made. But a lot of lawmakers in the United States complain about a stock change being owned by the Chinese and worry over it being owned by companies or parties related to the Chinese government.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The purchase price of the deal remains unknown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The takeover requires approval by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> and the Chicago exchange has voluntarily submitted the case for review by the </span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the US</span><span class="s1">, an inter-agency authority which has the power to block any deals that jeopardises US national security.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the bid succeeds, it would mark the first time Chinese-led companies have taken over a US bourse.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since China abruptly depreciated its currency last August, the country's wealthy have been trying to bypass the strict capital controls and transfer money abroad in many inventive ways, in search of better-yield investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts say the capital flight could stabilise, if the central bank effectively increases two-way flexibility of the exchange rate and tames the expectations of a falling yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of Monday, the yuan's official mid-point rate against the US dollar has plunged 9 per cent since August 11, 2015, when the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> stunned markets by lowering the daily fixing by 1.9 per cent, the largest cut ever.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has also slumped against most of its major currency rivals, down more than 10 per cent and 30 per cent respectively against the euro and the yen in the past 12 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expectations of a declining yuan, combined with the gloomy economic outlook, have sparked unprecedented capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most recent data shows China's FX reserves declined by US$4.1 billion in July to US$3,201 billion. Compared with the end of July in 2015, the reserves have shrank by US$450 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although the capital outflow pressure has eased from 12 months ago, it still persists," said Larry Hu, an analyst for Macquarie Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A considerable portion of the outflows may be due to Chinese residents' buying overseas assets, as they seek better and safer investments amid the decline of the home currency," he added.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China does not publish detailed figures about its capital outflows. But according to an estimation by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> in July, there were US$372 billion in outflows by Chinese residents spent on foreign assets in the second half of last year, and another US$108 billion left the country in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, net capital outflows amounted to US$123 billion in the first quarter, compared with US$504 billion in the second half of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In Q1 this year, ... and in H2 last year,... residents buying foreign assets accounted for around 70 per cent of the outflows," they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The official methods of Chinese residents' accumulation of FX assets include outward direct investment, portfolio investment assets, and other investment assets, according to the headline reported data from SAFE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Goldman analysts add the negative numbers in "net errors and omissions" might also represent disguised capital outflows, as that number ballooned in the third quarter of last year (See below chart).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/08/09/80e3a5f6-5de6-11e6-82a1-e6803dbb30ea_image_hires.jpg]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China imposes strict capital control on residents, only allowing each individual to buy no more than US$50,000 in overseas assets annually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, "there are some policy loopholes which people use to disguise their capital flight," Hu from Macquarie said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A widely used method is to fake invoices, such as overstating the value of imports," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, a Chinese company imports a machine and invoices it at US$1 million, while it's actually worth US$500,000. The company pays the actual amount and puts the rest of the money in offshore bank accounts or invests it in other overseas assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the Chinese banking regulator has tightened the scrutiny of residents' overseas transactions, " it's hard to eliminate those activities, " Hu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Hong Kong is being used to disguise such capital outflows, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Much of that money feeds through Hong Kong," said Victor Shih, a professor at </span><span class="s3">University of California, San Diego.Although</span><span class="s1"> the capital outflow pressure has eased from 12 months ago, it still persistsLarry Hu, analyst at Macquarie Research</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Imports from Hong Kong have surged since December, official statistics from China show.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, imports from Hong Kong grew 143 per cent year-on-year. In June and May each, imports from Hong Kong soared 144 per cent and 243 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese customs officials had previously attributed much of the surge to China's increasing imports of gold from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts say the figures still look a little suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Growth momentum like this looks very unusual, given the overall grim picture of imports and exports, though the base was comparatively small in 2015," said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he's been told by industry insiders that the number was likely inflated by bogus transactions that served as capital flight, a common practise among importers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In addition, more than half of imported goods from Hong Kong are jewellery, precious metals and related products. These low-weight but high-value commodities are ideal for virtual-high price quotations," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other methods of disguising capital flows include overstating the amount of an overseas M&amp;A, Collier added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese enterprises made outward direct investments totaling US$118 billion across all industries in 2015, up by 14.7 per cent from the previous year," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, much lower-than-expectation profitability of these overseas projects is what truly defines the nature of China's ODI largely as capital flight."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But for individuals who want to sneak out more than US$50,000 to buy overseas assets, such as a house in New York or Vancouver or Sydney, a popular way is to pool quotas of a group of family members or friends, with each person transferring US$50,000 out of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The process is called "smurfing" in the banking industry, or "ants moving their house" in Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another widely known method by individuals is to use underground private banks, which are popular in China's southeastern provinces such as Guangdong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Chinese resident can deposit 1 million yuan in his account in a domestic private bank, and take out the same value of money in foreign currencies, such as Hong Kong dollar or US dollar, in the overseas branches of the bank as quickly as within hours.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regardless of the methods being employed, however, Hu from Macquarie Research says the underground outflow to Hong Kong is still "manageable" for Chinese regulators, as total imports from Hong Kong are relatively small compared with overall imports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also expects the capital flight to moderate, as the yuan has stabilised in recent months and the market has also reacted more calmly to the currency's depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> can introduce more two-way flexibility of the exchange rate and effectively manage market expectations, residents will probably reduce their bets on the yuan's decline," Hu added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expects the yuan to reach between 6.6 to 6.8 against the US dollar by year-end, albeit "with more fluctuations".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank said US interest-rate increases would also push up the risks from highly leveraged corporate sectors in countries such as China,and highly indebted households in places like South Korea. This would be particularly true if these countries followed the US lead and raised their own rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Central banks could find themselves torn, wanting on the one hand to lower interest rates to support growth and householder balance sheets, but on the other to raise rates to stem capital outflow and support national currencies,” the bank said in the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consumer debt has grown sharply in Asia due to abundant cheap credit, with the majority in mortgage loans. In South Korea, total household debt rose to 91 per cent of gross domestic product last year, while both Thailand and Malaysia saw household debt jump to about 71 per cent of GDP, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chinese households are not as indebted as the ones in these countries, their leverage is shooting up at an alarming speed, according to the National Institution for Finance and Development in Beijing, a government-backed think tank. In 2016, the country's ratio of household debt to GDP climbed by 5 percentage points, or 6 trillion yuan (US$870 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Even though compared to China's GDP, household debt remains low [more than 40 per cent as of December 2016], in terms of proportion of household debt to residents' net wealth the leverage rate is quite high,” the think tank wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yasuyuki Sawada, ADB's chief economist, said on Thursday that he hadn't seen any concrete policy changes from the US and therefore would not expect to see any tangible economic impact on Asia in next two years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The administration of President Donald Trump is studying US trade relationships and trying to pinpoint which countries are “stealing jobs” from the country, as Trump has claimed about China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sawada said that for many middle-income Asian economies, the key to making the leap to “high income” was to increase productivity, which requires innovation and investment in people and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> defines a middle-income country as one with a gross national income per capita between US$1,026 and US$12,475. The ADB estimated that in 2015, more than 96 per cent of Asians were in the middle-income bracket by the </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1">'s standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been debate in China over whether it is “trapped” in the middle-income bracket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether you are trapped or not is not so much the issue,” said Joseph Ernest Zveglich, the ADB's director of macroeconomic research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's just that from low income to middle income, certain drivers in growth are going to be there. Economies that have made it that far have succeeded. But those factors are not going to be the ones that take them to the high income.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian financial markets responded well on Friday to the news from the United States that Jerome Powell had been officially nominated by President Donald Trump to take over the running of the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed up 0.26 per cent, while the KOSPI ended 0.46 per cent higher in Seoul and the Nikkei 225 climbed 0.53 per cent in Tokyo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, the Shanghai Composite Index ended the day down 0.34 per cent, though mainland Chinese stocks often buck wider Asian trends, and the appointment of a new chair of the US Fed would not be seen as a major market mover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Widely viewed as a dovish figure, Powell, 64, is expected to remain cautious on interest rate hikes and might even consider relaxing financial regulations. A member of the Fed's board of governors since 2012, the former managing director of </span><span class="s3">Carlyle Group</span><span class="s1"> will, subject to approval from the Senate, take over from Janet Yellen in February 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He's known for being soft on financial deregulation, which I suspect is why the market quite likes him, particularly banks,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist with </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1">, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any easing of the regulations on banks would likely provide a boost to the US economy and could stimulate consumer spending. That would be good news for exporting countries across Asia, including China, as demand for goods increased.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The upbeat market sentiment seen on Friday was in sharp contrast to the panic that spread across emerging markets three years ago when the Fed announced plans to temper its quantitative easing programme, followed by its first interest rise in almost a decade at the end of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Does Fed's latest move add urgency to Beijing's financial rescue mission?[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2112230/fed-rate-rises-squeeze-time-china-can-solve-financial-woes]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a painful time for Beijing, as the quarter-percentage point increase, coupled with the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s ill-timed forex reforms triggered a massive capital outflow, plunged the value of the yuan as low as seven to the US dollar, reduced forex reserves by nearly a tenth and forced the introduction of strict capital control measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Evans-Pritchard said he did not expect the US dollar to strengthen as much this time around, as the currency had already made significant gains over the past year and the market had factored in Trump's tax reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, “unlike a few years ago when the prospect of policy divergence was expected … the US [economy] looked pretty healthy and the rest of the developing world didn't … Now you have a globally synchronised recovery”, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its September minutes, the Fed said it expected three rate hikes next year, two in 2019 and one in 2020 until it reached 2.75 per cent and it could start downsizing its balance sheets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stems capital outflow after 22 months of bleeding money[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2116329/china-stems-capital-outflow-after-22-months-bleeding-money]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Iris Pang, chief Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong, said that while Powell might avoid sending any explicit signals of a policy turnaround to the market he might be more cautious in implementing the rate hikes than Yellen's Fed had suggested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ING expected two rate increases next year, Pang said, adding that the slower pace would keep the US dollar index at a low level, which would be good for the yuan's exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has been closely watching the Fed's moves, it has chosen this year not to match all of them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pang said Beijing was likely to continue to raise market interest rates next year after its policy rate guidance and liquidity management policies led to increases of about 50 basis points in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a move would be in line with the global trend of central banks either tightening liquidity or raising interest rates, she said, adding that it would also support the government's efforts to reduce debt levels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US Federal Reserve keeps rates flat but hints at one more increase by year's end[http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2112096/us-federal-reserve-keeps-rates-flat-hints-one-more-increase]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhong Yue, an analyst at ForexTime said that as Powell was largely seen as a supporter of Yellen's policies, there were no expectations of a dramatic monetary policy change on his watch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Likewise, the personnel change would have little impact on China's or other Asian economies, both of which have seen stable growth, although Beijing might be forced to play the rate hike game if the US stuck to its promise of steady increases, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Zhengwei, chief economist at Shanghai-based Industrial Bank, said that although Powell appeared dovish, he should be given time to show his cards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Powell's earlier statements represented the stance of his organisation, and not necessarily his personal views,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On matters such as exchange rates, therefore, until the new Fed chairman's policy can be properly assessed, “China should keep its destiny in its own hands”, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A senior </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> official said Tuesday that while the Hong Kong dollar had reached its weakest level in more than 30 years, this valuation was “well within the design of the system”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Howard Lee, deputy chief executive at the HKMA, Hong Kong's de facto central bank, was speaking at a press conference called to provide updates about the city's progress in its attempts to move into what it has called a “new era of smart banking”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dollar weakens to three-decade low, testing city's resolve to defend currency peg[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/money-news/article/2135737/hong-kongs-dollar-weakens-three-decade-low-testing-citys]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar touched new lows against the US dollar, and at mid afternoon, one US dollar was worth 7.8337 Hong Kong dollars, its lowest level in 33 years, before strengthening slightly. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, and its value is permitted to fluctuate between 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to one US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While we have not seen the Hong Kong dollar reach this level in the past, it is not a surprise,” said Lee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since the global financial crisis, we have seen large amounts of funds flow into Hong Kong, and now we are seeing these same funds flow out.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So far the weak end of the peg [7.85] has not been breached, which means that the market can cope with the current level of trading in Hong Kong dollars, but when it cannot, we will step in and take action,” said Lee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA is mandated to sell US dollars at HK$7.85 when necessary to protect the peg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change in rates was driven by wide yield differentials and concerns about trade conflicts, said Carie Li, economist at OCBC Wing Hang bank in a report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar benchmark lending rate (US dollar Libor) was 1.4475 per cent on Friday, compared to Hibor (the Hong Kong dollar benchmark rate) which was 0.07361 per cent on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said, however, that she did not expect the Hong Kong dollar to test the weak end of the peg in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As capital outflow risks remain well-contained, wide yield differential may only drive up USD/HKD at a moderate rate and allow the pair to find new resistance level around 7.835,” Li said in a written report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKMA sets out seven initiatives in effort to bolster fintech[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2113369/hkma-sets-out-seven-initiatives-effort-bolster-fintech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The press conference was initially called by the HKMA to provide updates about their progress in the seven areas they have identified to create a “new era of smart banking” in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said that all was on track for Hong Kong's faster payments system to come online in September this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The faster payments system will enable transactions and clearing to be made in real time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Lee said he anticipated that in the initial stages only basic services would be offered by the banks and stored value facilities as they would need time to get accustomed to the new systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These include customers being able to transfer funds from an account they hold with one bank, to an account they hold with another bank in real time, or being able to top up their stored value facilities digitally, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regard to the other initiatives, Lee said that 29 new products had been tested in Hong Kong's fintech supervisory sandbox, which allows companies to conduct pilot trials of fintech initiatives. Since the launch of the consultation document on virtual banking, more companies had indicated they were considering applying for a virtual banking licence, over and above the 10[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2130436/virtual-banks-queue-slice-hong-kong-market-hkma-pushes] that had already shown interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Lee said that no company had yet formally applied for a virtual banking licence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee also said that around 20 banks and eight stored value facilities planned to offer real time payment services to consumers when Hong Kong's faster payments system launches in September.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After China's finance minister Lou Jiwei retired, many China economic policy watchers are again asking how long it will be until Zhou Xiaochuan, China's longest-serving central bank governor, steps down and who can replace him?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The answer matters for the Chinese economy and the world because Zhou and Lou are regarded as the cream of the pro-market Chinese technocrats who argued for China's transition from a command to a market-based economy, as well as for China's integration into the world economy. They have played important roles in drafting and implementing economically liberal measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The duo's belief in creating a properly functioning market system, without challenging the absolute power of the Communist Party, started to influence and shape China's economic policies as early as the 1990s. Partly due to their guidance, China's monetary and fiscal policies, at least on the surface, resemble those of the United States more than of the former Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lou's departure and Zhou's expected retirement, therefore, raise doubts as to whether Beijing has the willingness or capacity to deepen its market liberalisation. The absence of a group of "reformists" in the economic policymaking area could lead to ill-designed policies and a retreat to the old days of administrative control, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's finance minister Lou Jiwei steps down, former tax chief to take role[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2043588/chinas-finance-minister-lou-jiwei-steps-down-former-tax-chief]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese economic reform is going in reverse towards a more state-dominated model," said Christopher Balding, an associate professor with the Peking University HSBC Business School in Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Unfortunately, the recent personnel movements seem to confirm this shift," he added. "It does appear as if people that might be more economically reform minded are being moved away from key positions, indicating a deeper foundation for a more state-centred focus on economic policy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The appointment of a new finance minister was announced earlier this month by the country's legislature when Lou was accompanying Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on a foreign visit. The new minister, Xiao Jie, worked previously as China's tax administration chief and there were few records of his views apart from a 2010 article saying China has room to raise taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese media outlet Caixin online said on Thursday that Lou had become the fifth chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund. The appointment was not unexpected as three of the four former (NSSF) chairmen were retired financial ministers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gossip about Zhou leaving has been circulating for years. Reuters and Bloomberg reported Zhou's departure years ago, although both were later proved wrong, and the Wall Street Journal in September 2014 reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping was considering removing Zhou, but that also didn't happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's central bank chief says his job is too difficult for many people to understand[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1981129/chinas-central-bank-chief-says-his-job-too-difficult-many-people]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it's clear that Zhou, at 68, is getting close to retirement. The unusual extension of his tenure was deemed to be because of the lack of a strong successor, and a reflection of the difficulties in pressing ahead with market-oriented reforms to reshape the pattern of economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Zhou has achieved much in the past 14 years, including revitalising China's state banking system, creating a huge onshore bond market, freeing up interest rate controls and making the yuan a nominal international reserve currency, there is still plenty to be done by his successors, including opening up the capital account to make the Chinese currency a truly convertible currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, after seeing massive capital outflow since late last year, the Chinese authorities have been tightening restrictions on capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The pace of the yuan's reform could have moved faster," said Chen Long, an economist with Gavekal Dragonomics. "The authority missed the chance to tolerate more flexible movement of the yuan in 2013 and 2014. But we still have hope to realise a free float in the coming two years."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has been a guessing game for a while as to who will succeed Zhou as the new central bank governor. The favourites so far include PBOC deputy governor Yi Gang, China Securities Regulatory Commission chairman Liu Shiyu and Bank of China chairman Tian Guoli.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I am confident the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will retain a reform-driven mindset, but the pace of reform may slow due to increasing uncertainties and risks globally and increasing tension and challenges facing Chinese economic growth and financial stability," said Zhu Ning, a finance professor at Tsinghua University.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, who headed the management of the foreign exchange reserves for seven years, is also a vice-director with the central economic and financial working group, an economic advisory body reporting directly to Xi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CSRC's Liu replaced Xiao Gang after a disastrous response to stock turmoil earlier this year, and quelled the market while favouring stability over reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [financial] reform does not depend on one personality," said Tim Condon, head of Asian financial market research at ING. "It comes from the top. Whoever takes over the central bank, he will manage to stay the course laid out by Zhou without too much interruption."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The buying euphoria over initial public offering shares renewed concerns about a capital outflow from existing holdings despite the regulator's efforts to control the pace of fresh equity supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the four companies that conducted online subscriptions on Wednesday, Shanghai Lianming Machinery saw its 8 million shares offered to public investors 515 times oversubscribed while Wuxi Xuelang Environmental Technology attracted subscriptions 393 times the amount of shares on offer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other two companies, </span><span class="s3">Feitian Technologies</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Shandong Longda Meat Foodstuff</span><span class="s1">, were also oversubscribed by more than 100 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing suspended new initial share sales in October 2012 to bolster investor confidence before the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> lifted the ban at the beginning of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dozens of companies that received listing approvals before October 2012 were allowed to raise funds on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in January and February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market buzz was that the first batch of offerings following a four-month hiatus would soak up funds from existing stocks as investors generally tend to punt on new shares to gain from first-day rallies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly all shares on the mainland tend to rise on the first day of trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CSRC chairman Xiao Gang announced last month that only 100 listings would be approved in the second half of this year, in an apparent effort to underpin existing stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.13 per cent to 2,026.67 points this week, the biggest weekly drop since the week to April 25. Worries are mounting among retail investors that the key market index will soon crash below the psychologically important 2,000-point level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many investors thought the initial public offerings provided them the only opportunity to make profits on the stock market," said West China Securities analyst Wei Wei. "The buying spree on the first four offerings was within expectations."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 600 companies have lined up to raise funds on the stock market amid Beijing's monetary tightening.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The CSRC plans to reform the listing mechanism to let market forces play a decisive role in fundraising activities. But a weak market has deterred the regulator from relinquishing its power on approving new stock offerings.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the struggles of the Turkish lira[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2159259/turkish-currency-craters-donald-trump-threatens-new-tariffs] illustrate a number of issues, markets should be wary about bracketing other Asian currencies in the same category. Ankara has its problems but many other Asian currencies, including the yuan[https://www.scmp.com/topics/yuan], are better anchored.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have characterised his country's current situation as an “economic war” and the slide in the value of the Turkish lira has been accentuated by the deterioration in relations between Turkey and the United States, but the currency was arguably already resting on poor foundations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Erdogan a self-described “enemy of interest rates”, the </span><span class="s3">Central Bank of Turkey</span><span class="s1"> has been slow to tighten monetary policy even though inflation in July was 15.85 per cent year-on-year, more than three times the </span><span class="s3">Turkish central bank</span><span class="s1">'s 5 per cent target.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additionally, Turkey runs a current account deficit and Turkish non-financial corporations have taken on a mountain of US dollar-denominated debt that has to be serviced. Not only does Turkey need foreign investment inflows to bridge that current account deficit gap, its companies need US dollars to service their debts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's financial help to Turkey will not turn around the troubled lira[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2159507/china-may-well-offer-financial-help-turkey-it-will-not-turn]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank for International Settlements</span><span class="s1"> data shows non-bank borrowers in Turkey had US$198 billion in outstanding US dollar debt at the end of the first quarter of 2018, representing almost 22 per cent of the US$910 billion current prices measure of Turkey's gross domestic product in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s April World Economic Outlook[http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/TUR].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Admittedly the same data showed non-bank borrowers in China had US$548 billion of outstanding US dollar debt, but that only represented some 4 per cent of the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s measure of China's GDP, at US$14 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a nutshell, China is far better placed than Turkey to manage that US dollar debt exposure, although that doesn't mean the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> will be complacent about yuan weakness[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2158428/yuan-pares-gains-traders-decide-central-bank-move-stifle].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the trade war[https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war] between Beijing and Washington, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> did stand back as the yuan depreciated in recent months but, effective from August 6, as </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> noted in its August Currency Outlook, the central bank imposed “a 20 per cent reserve requirement on banks that sell US dollar to clients using forward contracts (including FX swaps and options)”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Going forward, depending on market developments, more counter-cyclical measures may be announced,” </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> said, while recognising that “the risk of an even weaker [yuan] exists, considering the US' latest proposal to potentially impose punitive tariffs (be it 10 per cent or 25 per cent) on an additional US$200 billion of imports from China.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if the yuan keeps weakening, investors could rationally conclude that the move would be measured, with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> watchful in the background, rather than prove to be in free fall as has been the case with the Turkish lira.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More broadly, as analysts at </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong argued on Friday, emerging Asian economies “are in a strong position to absorb external shocks”, bolstered by “ample foreign exchange reserves to short-term external debt and prudent fiscal and monetary policy to prevent overheating” and having taken “decisive steps to ensure macroeconomic stability”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The French firm also noted that, in contrast to Turkey's current account deficit of 6.3 per cent of GDP, most “emerging market Asian countries have current account surpluses” and even the Philippines, Indonesia and India have deficits of less than 2 per cent of GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the case of the Philippines, the </span><span class="s3">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span><span class="s1"> raised interest rates by 50 basis points to 4 per cent on Thursday, its biggest hike in a decade, and its hawkish tone prompted US bank </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">, writing on Friday, to become “more constructive” on the outlook for the peso.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia's central banks are calling for ‘time out' on the easy-money party[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2159197/asian-central-banks-are-getting-their-mojo-back-calling]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Admittedly, in the same note, the US firm tweaked its forecasts for currencies such as the Taiwan dollar “to be slightly more bearish” but not because of anxiety about a contagion effect from the Turkish lira.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, it was the linkages between China and open economies in Asia that prompted Goldman's forecast adjustments, given that the US bank sees a risk of some further yuan weakness on a six-month horizon due to the ongoing China-US trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currencies of China and other economies in the region rest on much sounder foundations than the stricken Turkish lira. Investors shouldn't automatically assume that, just because Turkey's currency has collapsed in value, other currencies in Asia will also materially weaken.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of the Chinese yuan will remain stable against a basket of currencies, China's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Chengdu on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan rises for the fourth day ahead of G20 ministers meeting[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/1993180/yuan-rises-fourth-day-ahead-g20-ministers-meeting]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou, the longest-serving central bank governor among the so called </span><span class="s3">Group of 20</span><span class="s1"> nations, said that the currency's stability was the key message regarding the China yuan's policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also reiterated China's policy stance of "a managed floating exchange rate" system, in an apparent move to defy one-way betting on the yuan's future movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Late on Saturday, Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso said in Chengdu that he was closely watching China's economy and the decline in the value of the yuan, Reuters reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aso added that he had agreed with the United States Treasury Secretary Jack Lew about the need for structural reform in China and transparency in the yuan currency.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou's comments came as the world's major economic policymakers are set to pledge again that they will stay away from "competitive currency devaluations" as part of a global coordinated response to weak economic growth and financial market turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are sticking with a managed floating exchange rate system, and that's a policy stance we have been reiterating for years," Zhou said in a brief interview in the hallway of the venue of the G20 meeting, in response to a question whether the yuan would keep depreciating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked if the value of the yuan would be kept stable against a basket of currencies, Zhou said: "In my view, that's the line for all people to understand [about China's yuan policy]."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's major financial officials are meeting in Chengdu, the capital of China's southwestern province of Sichuan, for a two-day meeting to address the global weakness in economic growth and uncertainties as a result of the British referendum in June in which the electorate voted to leave the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far in Chengdu Zhou has not given any public speeches or held any press conferences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The commitment of </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> to a stable yuan against a basket of currencies was tested early last week when there was an apparent weakening of the yuan against the US dollar and a group of other currencies. But the yuan's exchange rate quickly strengthened on Thursday and Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The yuan had been kept stable against a basket of currencies for quite a long period of time, but recently it had weakened, so there might be some early suspicion in the international community," Ding Shuang, the chief China economist at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, said on the eve of the G20 meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The central bank prefers stability," Ding said. "It had increased intervention in the days before the G20 meeting in Chengdu."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank in Singapore, said: "</span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> won't give up the 6.7 [per cent dollar/yuan exchange rate] level very easily. It would be quite risky if the level was given up easily - if the yuan weakens to 6.8 per cent against the dollar, it would overthrow many previous beliefs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao Yang, the chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said."Over a long-term perspective, there are depreciation pressures on the yuan against the dollar, but it's another matter whether the yuan will depreciate against a basket of currencies - the euro and yen are quite uncertain."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Downward pressure on the yuan had come from China's economic slowdown and capital outflow pressures over next two or three years, Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The central bank has done a quite good job during the past half year as it has been allowing yuan depreciation in a managed and controllable way," Zhao said. "There's no panic, and there's an agreed bottom line now that there won't be any one-off yuan revaluation."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese insider transactions slowed in September from the previous month, giving a temporary relief to stock investors on the mainland who'd been nervous about a major sell-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The A-share holdings of 100 major shareholders shrank to 21 billion yuan (US$3.15 billion) in September, 7 billion yuan less than in August, according to data by state-run Securities Times newspaper.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smaller-than-expected sales data is giving skittish investors cause for pause, easing their concern that insiders may be preparing to dump their holdings to cash out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's retail investors tend to look to stock purchases or sales by insiders -- substantial owners, company founders, management and large institutions who are believed to be in the know -- for clues of the market's direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai-listed </span><span class="s3">Epoxy Base Electronic Material</span><span class="s1"> was one such indicator. Its major owners pared their holdings 10 times in September, selling 30.7 million shares to rake in 200 million yuan. The stock's price fell 3.8 per cent in the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The sluggish market performance was the result of a lack of fresh funds and confidence, not massive selling from the large shareholders," said Haitong Securities analyst Zhang Qi. "On the mainland, the stock market would become something akin to a pool of stagnant water without fund inflows."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai's A-share index fell 2.6 per cent in September to 3,004.7 at the Friday close, hovering near a psychological 3,000-point watershed between the boom and bust cycles of the Chinese stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark index dipped below the 3,000 level early last week, raising speculations among investors who're already nervous about a combination of slower Chinese economic growth and an impending US interest rates increase that insiders could be preparing a major sell-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The outlook is pessimistic," said Zhou Ling, a hedge fund manager at Shiva Investment. "Liquidity seems to have dried up and nothing could stem the capital outflow because retail investors still choose to cash out at this moment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That speculation never came to pass, as Securities Times' data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's securities regulator has been trying to stabilise Asia's largest capital market since June last year, slowing down the approval process for companies seeking to raise funds through initial public offers, and putting on hold plans to liberalise the market, in order to shore up confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stable stock market is vital for China's leadership and the country's economy, amid concern that millions of shareholders in hock could spill over into social strife, while making it difficult for cash-starved companies to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main gauge is now more than 40 per cent off the June 12, 2015 level of 5,166.35 on June 12, 2015 when a market rout began, wiping out more than US$5 trillion in market capitalisation in two months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another round of hefty drops on the A-share market would likely prompt regulators to take drastic actions to put a floor under plummeting stock prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That expectation gives some investors hope.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Stock investors are hoping for a turnaround after getting stuck with paper losses for more than a year," said a retail investor Dong Yanjun. "We are fidgety about any negative news that could affect the market movement."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday lowered the yuan's midpoint rate by 0.5 per cent, or 340 basis points, to 6.6497 against the greenback, having raised it by 0.01 per cent on Monday. Until Friday, the central bank had set the currency's midpoint lower in the previous eight trading days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Analysts are widely speculating that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is willing to see a weaker yuan to prepare for the impact of the trade war,” said Jasper Lo, chief investment strategist at Hong Kong-based Eddid Securities and Futures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current trade war is not just leading to a weaker yuan but also a weaker trend for other emerging market currencies. Traders widely believe US President Donald Trump is very keen on pushing the trade war against China and other countries and this will lead to a strong US dollar against other currencies. The yuan is likely to trade around 6.70 level for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lo, however, does not believe it will decline much further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan has gone down a total of 5 per cent in the past 14 trading days. The level of 6.70 per US dollar will be a resistance level. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would like to see a weaker yuan but does not want to repeat the mistake it made in August of 2015 when it fell more than 2 per cent in one day,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market then drove the yuan down much lower and that led to a massive capital outflow. China would not like to see that happen again. If the yuan drops any further, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is likely to take action to support it.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's equity markets have stabilised after weeks of selling, but it may be best to stay on the sidelines rather than pile in for bargain hunting as the turbulence affecting global markets could resume at any time, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.54 per cent last week, to end at 2,916.56 on Friday. The benchmark has dropped by about 700 points in the previous two weeks, and now sits well below 3,539.18, its closing level at the end of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, offshore yuan strengthened for a second week. </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on January 12 used a shock and awe approach to push up the yuan's lending cost in Hong Kong. These included the introduction of tightening measures to drain offshore liquidity and curb capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although the rest of the world is still in panic about China's slowdown and volatility, China itself seems temporarily calmed. However, the falling oil price, geopolitical tensions, and the prospect of further rate hikes from the US still weigh on the global market and can spill over to China," said Adam Xu, a mutual fund manager based in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu said his strategy was "to stay as prudent as I can by holding a low position in equities".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu said his fund remained overweight on sectors that include coal mining, high-speed rail, and infrastructure, as the government seems ready to step up fiscal spending for economic stimulus, while supply-side reforms begin to take effect, benefitting some strong competitors in the manufacturing industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> is even more bearish, and recommended investors to be ultra-defensive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank forecast the Shanghai Composite to trade in a range between 2,200 to 4,000, and end at around 2,600 by year end. The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index in Hong Kong, tracking mainland based companies, would likely trade in a range between 7,400 to 12,800, the investment bank said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our top overweight sectors are telecommunications, power, staples, healthcare, and infrastructure operators; our top underweight sectors are financials, property and resources," it said in a note issued Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-led interventions in the mainland equity and currency markets have prevented market prices from adjusting to reflect China's deteriorating fundamentals, and resulted in increased volatility in Hong Kong assets, said Hong Hao, chief strategist with Bocom International. He advised investors to "sit tight for a little longer".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the Hang Seng Index surged 2.90 per cent, or 538.36 point to 19,080.51. In spite of the gains, the index finished in the red for the week, giving up 2.26 per cent, marking a fourth consecutive weekly loss.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Hong Kong dollar extended its downbeat performance for a third week. The downtrend abated on Thursday however, lifted by large buy orders at 7.8294, its lowest in eight and a half years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said there might buying opportunities for mainland shares in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Historical data shows Chinese equity markets tend to advance ahead of the "two sessions", which refers to the annual gathering of the nation's legislators and political advisors in Beijing every March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the past 16 years, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rallied in 14 of them before the two sessions, the Shanghai Securities Journal said on Friday. The biggest rally came in March 2000, when the Shanghai Composite gained 13.23 per cent, while the Shenzhen Component Index rose 13.56 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of Hong Kong's largest banks have been in a race to promote fixed-time deposit schemes, themed around Mother's Day with offers of higher interest rates to attract more savings - a clear sign that lenders are scrapping over new customers as more capital continues to flow out of the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While most small depositors still earn zero interest on savings accounts, banks are now offering larger depositors higher rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, Bank of China Hong Kong (BOC HK), Citi and many others have started offering rates as high as 2.7 per cent to lure deposits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts now believe zero rates for smaller depositors could soon become a thing of the past, at least for the foreseeable future, and overall lending amounts could rise in June for the first time in 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The banks' rates are intricately linked to Hong Kong's property industry, where average home prices have continued rising non-stop every month for two years, making the city the world's most expensive urban city to live in. Any rise in interest rates could spillover into mortgage payments, taking the wind out of the property market, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Explainer: Why Hong Kong homebuyers should take note if city's aggregate balance dips below HK$100 billion[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2147163/why-hong-kong-homebuyers-should-take-note-if-citys-aggregate]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weakening of the Hong Kong dollar, which recently dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar in 35 years, has led some HK$60 billion (US$7.64 billion) to flow out of Hong Kong for other markets, said Jasper Lo, chief investment strategies at Eddid Securities and Futures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The capital outflow has resulted in less money in the banking sector and hence led the Hibor (Hong Kong interbank offered rate) to increase to a record level in almost a decade,” he said. “When commercial banks find it too expensive to pay that level to get the money in the interbank market, it is natural for them to offer higher deposit rates to customers.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/22/f8fc85e4-5b69-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_image_hires_133051.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 3-month Hibor rose to 1.75 per cent on Friday while the 1-month Hibor was at almost 1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bank of China offers the highest deposit rate in the city. From May 9 to 18, a 12-month deposit of at least HK$50,000 could earn customers 2.7 per cent per annum. The bank's spokesman said it had not decided if similar offers would be made to coincide with Father's Day (June 17 in Hong Kong).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> on Friday increased its 9-month Hong Kong dollar time deposit promotional offer to 2.1 per cent for new “SupremeGold” customers, with initial deposits starting at HK$100,000. That's 72 basis points higher than three months ago, at 1.28 per cent, according to its website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ICBC Asia is offering all new customers a time-deposit promotion, under which a 388-day, HK$100,000 deposit pays 2.08 per cent, while HK$800,000 would earn 2.18 per cent. The promotion started from April 3 and will last until June 29.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, the city's largest lender, pays less than 2 per cent interest, but with the lowest threshold at only HK$10,000, earning a higher 1.6 per cent interest rate on six-month deposits, and 1.8 per cent over 12 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Initially, banks pay more to attract larger time depositors,” said Eddid Securities' Lo. “Small customers could be next.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank has increased its interest rates twice this month on May 2 and 16 to their current levels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citi has also been less aggressive in its rate amounts, but more flexible on deposit amounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Existing clients with HK$10,000 can get 1.3 per cent for a three-month deposit while new customers with HK$50,000 or more for a three-month time deposit will earn up to 1.5 per cent, from May 4 until May 25.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">George Leung, a HSBC adviser for the Asia-Pacific, said Hong Kong's interest rates are certainly on the way up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A number of banks have increased their time deposit rates several times this year, with some offering up to 2 per cent for a 12-months fixed term,” he said. “This reflects just how a local, upwards rate cycle has already begun. The eventual increase in their best-lending rates [the interest rate at which banks lend to favoured customers] is the last sign to be seen in a rising cycle.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be hard to predict when best lending rates would stop increasing, as much depends on market conditions, Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many new-economy companies will float shares in Hong Kong over the second half of this year, which may also interrupt the current Hibor trend,” he said. “It is difficult to judge when best lending rates will rise in Hong Kong due to the ‘complexity of the conditions involved.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commercial banks could increase their best lending rates as soon as June, soon after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is next expected to raise its interest rates, Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">'s best lending rate is currently 5 per cent while other lenders range between 5 to 5.25 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The last time </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> increased its best lending rate was March 30, 2006, when it increased it by 25 basis points from 7.75 per cent to 8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That was then followed by the interest rate cutting cycle, and the last time it changed its best lending was almost a decade ago on November 10, 2008, when it was lowered by 25 basis points to the current level at 5 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong and mainland China stock markets rallied on Monday, after the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> signalled it would guide the market more proactively in the face of a stronger US dollar and the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing. Shares in the automobile sector also surged after </span><span class="s3">Brilliance China Automotive Holdings</span><span class="s1"> posted better than expected interim results.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose by 2.2 per cent, or 599.40 points, to 28,271.27, its biggest daily rise since February 14. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index also gained 2.5 per cent, or 269.42 points, to 11,049.13, marking its biggest daily increase since January 2.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the stock markets closed on Friday, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said a component known as the countercyclical factor had been resumed in the setting of the yuan daily reference rate to counter depreciation. This caused the offshore yuan to rise to its highest level since July 31, although it subsequently reversed to a 0.09 per cent drop, to 6.8115 against the dollar, on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s action to stabilise the yuan was today's main driver of the stock market,” said Alex Wong Kwok-ying, director of Ample Finance Group. “But concerns remain over Hong Kong companies' growth story.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency is likely to find a floor at the above 7 yuan per dollar level for now, but trade tensions with the US have not gone away and another US$200 billion of Chinese goods could be hit with a 25 per cent tariff early next month, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at </span><span class="s3">ANZ Bank</span><span class="s1">. The market will still need to see how trade relations evolve, and how the Chinese economy responds to the recent easing measures, Goh added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar touched the lower limit of its permitted trading range at 7.8500 per US dollar on Monday once again, showing that capital outflow pressure from the city remained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, </span><span class="s3">Brilliance China Automotive Holdings</span><span class="s1"> surged by 14.7 per cent to HK$12.50 after reporting an interim net profit growth of more than 54 per cent. Other carmakers rose in tandem, with </span><span class="s3">Geely Automobile Holdings</span><span class="s1"> advancing by 7 per cent to HK$17.50, becoming the best performing blue chip in the process. </span><span class="s3">Guangzhou Automobile Group</span><span class="s1"> climbed by 6.8 per cent to HK$7.70 and </span><span class="s3">Dongfeng Motor Group</span><span class="s1"> jumped by 5.2 per cent to HK$7.90.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rally on Monday was also supported by gains recorded by stocks of mobile handset equipment makers and Chinese property developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lens maker </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">jumped by 6.7 per cent to HK$98.20 and Apple supplier </span><span class="s3">AAC Technologies Holdings</span><span class="s1"> added 3.2 per cent to HK$85. But camera modules maker Q Technology (Group) slid by 7.5 per cent to HK$5.41 after announcing it had swung to a net loss of 51.3 million yuan (US$7.53 million) in the first half of 2018, as against a 202 million yuan profit for the same period last year. Turnover declined by 11 per cent yearly to 3.207 billion yuan in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese property developers also fared well. </span><span class="s3">Sunac China Holdings</span><span class="s1"> advanced by 6.7 per cent to HK$26.45, </span><span class="s3">Agile Group Holdings</span><span class="s1"> rose by 5.1 per cent to HK$12.28 and </span><span class="s3">China Resources Land</span><span class="s1"> increased by 3.1 per cent to HK$27.90.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">, meanwhile, rose by 2.9 per cent to HK$7.09, adding 61 points to the benchmark index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Sinopec Corp</span><span class="s1"> climbed by 5.1 per cent to HK$7.90 after reporting a profit that rose by 115 per cent from a year earlier to 23 billion yuan in the second quarter. </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> said it expected the company to sustain this outperformance during the remainder of the year. </span><span class="s3">PetroChina</span><span class="s1"> increased by 3.6 per cent to HK$6.01 and </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1"> was higher by 2.1 per cent at HK$13.62.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.9 per cent, or 51.47 points, to 2,780.90. The CSI 300, which tracks the large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, increased by 2.4 per cent, or 81.23 points, to 3,406.57.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen Composite Index was higher by 2.5 per cent, or 36.38 points, at 1,496.71, and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">-style ChiNext rose by 3 per cent, or 43.34 points, to 1,493.43 on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a sign of Beijing's growing wariness about capital outflows, China's foreign exchange administration issued a notice on Friday requiring banks to report every cash withdrawal made outside its borders, and every overseas card transaction valued over 1,000 yuan (US$147).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the new regulation put out by the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, banks must submit a report of overseas transaction information on a daily basis from September 2 - even on holidays and weekends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has already tightened controls over the use of bank cards in Hong Kong and abroad.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That came after Beijing in December 2016 halved the amount of cash </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> cardholders could withdraw from ATMs in Macau to 5,000 patacas (US$610).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange regulator is trying to put together a detailed picture of how Chinese are spending abroad.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In line with the increasing need for global cooperation on anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing and addressing tax base erosion, statistics on cross-border bank card transactions need improved transparency and data quality,” the regulator said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The regulator wants to obtain comprehensive data on overseas consumer spending habits to improve management,” according to Wen Bin, chief economist with </span><span class="s3">China Minsheng Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese travellers spent some US$261 billion during 135 million overseas trips in 2016 - more than double the expenditure of Americans, according to a United Nations report released in April. That would mean mainland Chinese travellers spent an average of nearly US$2,000 on each trip taken last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overseas withdrawals of UnionPay cardholders are capped at 10,000 yuan per day, with an annual cap of 100,000 yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luxury brands and high-quality products - including cosmetics, smartphones, designer clothing and accessories - are often on the shopping lists of mainland Chinese when they travel abroad. Many of these commonly sought-after items could easily tip them over the 1,000 yuan reporting threshold.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has since late 2015 been tightening its capital controls to stem the risks of continuous capital outflow and safeguard the yuan, including restricting big acquisitions and overseas investments.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A tug of war has erupted between the mainland's securities regulator and top economic planning agency for control over the private-equity sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a circular that raised eyebrows among China-watchers following the mainland's recent cabinet reshuffle, the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC) reiterated previous rulings that private equity funds would be barred from selling mutual funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statement was seen as a confrontational engagement with the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> (CSRC), which conducted a major liberalisation of market regulations in February to bolster institutional buying on the volatile stock market. Among the reforms was granting private-equity groups access to the mutual fund sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conflict between the two ministry-level authorities comes as an embarrassment to newly elected Premier Li Keqiang, who has pledged to streamline government to create a business-friendly regulatory environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a move it said was aimed at stabilising the roller-coaster stock market, the securities regulator planned to allow about 50 non-mutual fund institutions including banks, brokerages and private-equity groups to manage funds slated for stock investments. The plan was hailed as a savvy policy since its announcement injected vigour into the mutual fund sector, which has suffered a huge brain drain in past years as star fund managers were attracted by hedge funds' better pay and perks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the NDRC, authorised to manage the private-equity industry since 2005, appears determined to maintain a tight grip over private-equity funds despite what is seen by critics as inefficient control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [NDRC's] control over the sector didn't prove efficient," said Z-Ben Advisors' chief researcher, Howhow Zhang. "It will be just a matter of time before it is forced to relinquish its authority on the industry."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under existing rules, mainland private-equity funds with total assets exceeding 500 million yuan (HK$618 million) each must be registered with the NDRC. However, only 36 of several thousand funds are currently registered, and unregistered funds are operating freely. According to fund managers, the only drawback for sidestepping the NDRC approval procedure was that they wouldn't be allowed to manage assets for the national pension fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The NDRC's circular last week further reflected a maze of contradictions and wrangling among government bodies with different vested interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2007, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> unilaterally unveiled the so-called through-train scheme that allowed mainland residents to directly buy Hong Kong-listed shares. But the policy never took effect amid obstructions from the CSRC, which was battered by worries over a capital outflow from the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Weiying, economics professor at </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1">, recently criticised the NDRC for failing in its responsibility for reform. As a result it is locked in a power struggle with the CSRC for control over private-equity funds, leaving cash-rich investors and fund managers to play a guessing game about whose policies they should abide by.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More and more mainlanders are looking to diversify their wealth into foreign real estate assets after the recent stock market rout and government intervention, finds a survey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">East-West Property Advisors, a consultancy that helps Asians buy US properties, polled 170 mainland clients and partners through </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> and found more than half of them are considering buying overseas properties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's basically an increase compared with what we have seen in the media and our conversations [with clients] before," Sam Van Horebeek, the Hong Kong-based firm's founder, told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from concerns about the slowing economy, feedback from respondents also showed they were worried about the stock market volatility and the government's role, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"[The government's intervention] has created a lot of confusion and nervousness," Horebeek said. "People don't believe that the regulators are being transparent or allowing the markets move freely."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The impact will be the opposite of what they wish for as investors' mistrust grows, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An article circulated on </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> by a mainland investor said: "This is a stock market disaster that has wiped out middle class wealth accumulated over a decade of hard work, and this is a stock market disaster that has deprived a whole generation of their Chinese dream."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As such, mainland people are trying to diversify their assets outside the country, including in real estate and fixed-income, according to the survey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow into foreign real estate has soared in recent years. An annual survey by the </span><span class="s3">National Association of Realtors</span><span class="s1"> showed Chinese were the biggest foreign buyers in the United States both in terms of the number and value of transactions in April 2014 through March 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese, including those from Hong Kong and Taiwan, bought US homes worth US$28.6 billion during the period, more than double that of Canadians, who came in second with US$11.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data from global consultancy CBRE showed the Chinese invested US$10.5 billion in foreign real estate market last year, up from US$1 billion in 2010. Chinese direct investment in Australian property exceeded those from the United States to become the second-largest after Singaporeans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Flows from China into global markets are expected to remain firm, with potential upside, as regulatory changes over the last three years have allowed a higher investment allocation into real estate for life insurers [rising from 10 per cent to 30 per cent] and offshore investment to a limit of 15 per cent across all assets classes," wrote CBRE's Australian research head Stephen McNabb.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's small-cap stocks may drop further as efforts by policymakers to curb the overseas buying spree by domestic corporates is exposing the weakness of their financials, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen's tech-focused ChiNext index is stabilising near a 30-month low after nearly 500 stocks fell by their daily limit of 10 per cent on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges early last week in what analysts dubbed as “Black Monday”. The price to earnings ratio for the ChiNext index has dropped to 47 times from a peak of 145 times in 2015, according to data on the Shenzhen exchange's website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The slide in the ChiNext comes after the central government late last year tightened its grip on investments abroad as part of a crackdown on riskier forms of fund raising. On Monday, the official </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> news agency said following a meeting by the Communist Party's top decision-making body the Politburo, chaired by President Xi Jinping, that China will strengthen coordination of financial regulation, stabilise the property market and prevent systemic financial risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese investors pull back from Hong Kong in wake of Beijing's capital controls</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's leading corporations including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, HNA and </span><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> - which had in recent years undertaken a spending spree overseas in line with the government's “Going Out” policy and internationalisation initiatives - have now come under increasing regulatory scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the crackdown is hurting small firms that have done overseas acquisitions even more because they are unable to meet growth targets promised when the deals were made, resulting in goodwill impairments in company financials and triggering worries over their earnings outlook, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In accounting, goodwill impairment arises when there is a deterioration in the capability of acquired assets to generate cash flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent weeks a number of listed companies on the ChiNext start-up board have issued warnings of significant losses in the first half, including the troubled </span><span class="s3">Leshi Internet Information &amp; Technology</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Overseas acquisitions are a problem when they are merely used to support fake financial statements,” said Tan Han, analyst at Guotai Junan Securities. “Weak companies showing goodwill impairment after they made overseas acquisitions are gradually deflating a market bubble.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ChiNext board and the new third board, the National Equities Exchange and Quotation, was meant to be China's answer to the US </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> exchange for technology start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No sign of easing in capital controls even as China's overseas shopping spree continues, experts say[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2094441/no-sign-capital-controls-easing-chinas-overseas-shopping-spree-continues]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors in recent years have been chasing a wave of Chinese start-ups listed on ChiNext and the new third board which promised “high growth prospects” with their overseas investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this allowed small firms with declining profits to use overseas investments to dress up their balance sheets and avoid being delisted, while supporting inflated stock prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of overseas acquisitions made by acquirers listed on ChiNext - including the net debt of the target company - rose 146 per cent year on year to US$2.2 billion in the first half of 2017, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When financial conditions were strong, China may have allowed overseas acquisitions such as the purchase of iconic buildings or iconic businesses as part of its soft power [push],” said Alicia Garcia Herroro, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1">. “But given the capital outflow concerns now, China may not want to spend money on such acquisitions that don't provide technologically advantages and when hard currency is scarce,” she said</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts also say that purchasing assets unrelated to their own core business can waste a companies resources. “China is now rationalising its purchases abroad after this learning process,” Herroro said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the government's crackdown has made it more difficult for listed companies, especially those in poor financial health, to raise funds for overseas acquisitions while stronger, larger corporations will be less affected because they are able to grow organically, said Qiu Zhicheng, executive director and strategist at ICBC International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February, the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">tightened rules for the sale of private share placements by mandating that such sales should not be made within 18 months of a previous fundraising round by the firm. In May, the CSRC also required substantial shareholders to space out the disposal of their stakes in publicly traded companies by barring them from selling their holdings through so-called block trades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, major investors could purchase shares in a domestic company through a private placement at a 20-30 per cent discount price, then when the company made a overseas acquisition that caused the stock price to rise, the investor would sell the shares and profit from the arbitrage. CSRC's revised rules are reining in such financing activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, IT start-ups and small firms remain in a stock bubble but valuations for stocks in sectors such as financials and cyclicals have returned to more reasonable levels, said Guotai Junan's Tan. Meanwhile, Qiu predicts ChiNext's price to earnings ratio to slip further to about 30 times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore Chinese yuan declined on Wednesday against the US dollar after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> guided it to the lowest level in almost two months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan, which trades mainly in Hong Kong, dropped 0.04 per cent to 6.8997 per dollar as of 12.15pm, compared with 6.8938 late on Tuesday. In the past month, the rate has depreciated almost 1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spot yuan briefly fell in Shanghai earlier in the morning, but then reversed its course and ticked higher by 0.01 per cent to 6.8993 per dollar by 12.15pm. Nonetheless, the onshore rate has weakened by 0.5 per cent versus the greenback since the start of February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier in the day, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan's mid-point rate at 6.9032 per US dollar, the lowest since January 12, and down by 75 basis points from the previous fix of 6.8957.The February FX reserve data suggests that the policy efforts to contain capital outflows may have started to show some impactGrace Ng and Haibin Zhu, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government statistics released on Tuesday showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose by US$6.9 billion in February to US$3.005 trillion, above market consensus estimates, and the first monthly increase since June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many market watchers interpreted the surprise increase as a result of tighter capital controls and a sign that Beijing may tolerate a more volatile yuan further down the road.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The February FX reserve data suggests that the policy efforts to contain capital outflows may have started to show some impact,” said Grace Ng and Haibin Zhu, analysts for JP Morgan, in a research note on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Excluding currency valuation effects, the forex reserves may have risen US$23 billion in February, in stark contrast with January's decline of US$38.8 billion, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> estimated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Stricter capital outflow measures imposed on individuals and corporates may have in the near term managed to slow private sector capital outflows,” the analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Mark Williams, economists at Capital Economics, said closures of banks during the Chinese New Year holidays in February may have caused disruption to capital flows. They believe the picture will become clearer after the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> publishes its balance sheet data later this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Societe Generale</span><span class="s1"> analysts expect Beijing to become more tolerant of the yuan's depreciation in the near future, based on their interpretation of the wording of the new government work report released at the annual parliamentary sessions in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year's government work report left out the familiar phrase of ‘keep RMB relatively stable around an appropriate level' and replaced it with ‘to maintain the stable status of the renminbi in the international currency system',” said Wei Yao, a China economist for Societe Generale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This omission of the old phrase has drawn much attention and been taken as a signal that Chinese policymakers are ready to embrace more volatility or even more depreciation of the RMB.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As developments in the past two years have illustrated, China's pledge to “keep the renminbi stable” could still mean further depreciation against the dollar or the basket of currencies, Yao added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other forex trading on Wednesday, the </span><span class="s3">ICE</span><span class="s1"> US Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback's strength against six currency rivals, moved lower to 101.75 from 101.81 late on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against the Japanese yen, the US dollar fell sharply, down 0.3 per cent to ¥113.66.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The euro weakened slightly against the US currency, trading at US$1.0564 from US$1.0566 late on Tuesday. However, sterling rose to US$1.2207 from US$1.22 in the prior session.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign businesses are becoming increasingly frustrated by Beijing's lack of action to open up its markets, according to the European Union's envoy to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is leading to more frustration among the [European] business community that they haven't seen their words translated into action,” the EU's ambassador to China Hans Dietmar Schweisgut told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies see the rising gap between rhetoric and what's happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the </span><span class="s3">World Economic Forum</span><span class="s1"> in Davos in January firmly endorsing free trade and has promised to further open up the country's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council had pressured its departments to work out a timetable by the end of September to ease market restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the meantime, however, there are signs of new trade and investment barriers in China. Beijing suspended imports of some cheese products and required additional certificates for low-risk food imports from October 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign firms are also complaining about the possibility they will be forced to make technology transfers in exchange for market access.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Foreign companies are increasingly discouraged by the fact that policy announcements and the objectives [of market openness] are not translated into action,” the ambassador said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a more cautious attitude and more reluctance to take those announcements at face value.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker proposed to set up a screening framework for foreign investment in </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> countries during his state of the union address on September 13, the same day that the United States banned acquisition of </span><span class="s3">Lattice Semiconductor</span><span class="s1"> by a Chinese equity fund.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Juncker's proposal, which was made in response to pressure from the German, French and Italian governments, was interpreted as a countermeasure to the rapid inflow of Chinese investment designed to buy up hi-tech firms and know-how from Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> also agreed on tough new rules to curb cheap imports, which Juncker described as an “anti-dumping measure” - although he insisted it was not aimed at any country in particular.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The takeover of German robot manufacturer Kuka by Chinese appliance producer Midea last year has prompted controversy in the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> due to concerns about public security.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, there is growing discontent about the lack of reciprocity, with the almost unlimited investment possibilities in the EU for Chinese investors compared with the restrictions foreign investors face in China in fields such as cars, health care, insurance and telecoms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> does not have an agency like the </span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) </span><span class="s1">to review foreign investments, but its member states have set up or tightened their own investment legislation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The EU ambassador said the proposals were designed for security and to protect public order and where not directed at any one country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is not designed to be an instrument to restrict Chinese investment into Europe,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's investment in the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> last year grew by 77 per cent compared with 2015 to €35 billion (US$41 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Much of that came from state-owned enterprises in industries covered by the nation's Made in China 2025 strategy to bolster its hi-tech strength, according to a report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">'s investment in China fell for the fourth straight year to €8 billion, down 23 per cent last year, while its investment in the United States reached US$277 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">'s investment into China was only a fraction of the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">'s investment into the United States, and there was great potential to expand </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> investment into China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the future, if you look at the size and importance of our economies, it would be a huge waste of opportunity not to fully utilise this potential,” the envoy said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And it can only be utilised if China opens [its market].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our market is open and China's market needs to be equally open. The current situation cannot go on forever. Otherwise it is bound to lead to a backlash.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are looking for equal opportunities. There needs to be reciprocity in market access. This is not linked to the investment screening. European companies should have the same opportunities as Chinese ones [in Europe].”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The question of how to lower barriers to market access is also expected to be an area of contention during talks about a bilateral investment agreement between the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Talks about the proposal - known formally as the Comprehensive Agreement of Investment - started in November 2013 and the latest round of talks will take place in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar talks about a bilateral investment treaty between China and the United States ended in stalemate last year, with the US expressing dissatisfaction at the number of market access restrictions the Chinese wanted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Having the right substance and a solid agreement is more important than speed. We hope we can move to the decisive phase soon to exchange the negative lists [on market access limitations],” the ambassador said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have a strong agenda between China and the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">. At the same time relations between China and the 28 member states are also expanding. That is normal. That is also something we welcome,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is also engaged with some member and some non-member states in regional cooperation. There could be a risk if this is not only about advancing trade and concrete investment opportunities but interferes with </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> competences and policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We do not wish this cooperation to undermine the cohesion of the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">. It should instead be in line with the wider aspiration to advance the EU-China agenda.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I hope China will also in practice do what it is saying all the time, that it is supporting </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> integrity. China should also counter such suspicions which have sometimes emerged,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our relationship is established on trust. The </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> is a union of 28 sovereign member states, but it is also a union which wants to be treated as such. There is clear expectation that the cohesion and identity of the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> is fully respected,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan hit a four-month high on Friday, strengthening after the central bank set the reference price sharply higher against the US dollar as the latter continued to fall against other currencies following the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s decision to pause its planned interest rate hikes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan rose to 6.4434 to the US dollar in early trade on Friday, up 0.17 per cent from Thursday when it rose 0.45 per cent, and the biggest single-day jump in a month. Offshore yuan is at its strongest level since December 3, similar to the level seen mid-August right after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> devalued the currency by 2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was trading at 6.4602 at 11am, on track to rise 0.33 per cent this week - the third straight week of gains. It has risen 1.64 per cent against the US dollar this year, reversing course from the first week of the year, when it was down 2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are lots of moving parts and despite an air of caution chasing this Asia basket currency rally, we are likely to see continued strength on the back of improving local equity markets," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda Asia-Pacific, on the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s yuan fixing on Friday at 333 basis points higher at 6.4628 shows the central bank "plays into the notion that an imminent yuan devaluation is fading into the background".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency is allowed to trade two per cent in either direction of the mid price set by the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan also rose to a three-month high at 6.4595 to the US dollar on Friday morning the strongest since December 14. It rose It rose 0.68 per cent from Thursday, which was the biggest single- day jump in a month. It has risen 0.46 per cent this week and has now appreciated 0.43 per cent against the US dollar this year, a turnaround from a depreciation of 1.56 per cent in the first week of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan thus joins the rally in the euro, the yen and other Asian currencies, which have all risen more than 1 per cent against the dollar following the Fed 's announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fed chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday kept the interest rates unchanged and presented projections that suggested there would only be two quarterly rate increases this year rather than the four predicted last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed's move pushed down the dollar against the euro, the yen, the Australian dollar and other Asian currencies apart from the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar rose to 7.7537 on Friday against the greenback, nearing this year's strongest level of 7.7503. The local currency had dropped to 7.8294 on January 20 as capital outflow from the city spiked after the US increased interest rates in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Innes said Yellen's dovish stance on interest rates has led to the slide in the US dollar, "especially against a backdrop of improving risk sentiment and commodity currencies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the road now paved, we could be in store for a substantial rally in commodities, emergency market currencies and gold," Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan mid price against the euro at 7.3253, weaker by 365 basis points; against 100 yen at 5.8165, weaker by 557 basis points; and at 9.3696 against the pound, weaker by 1,026 basis points.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan has recorded its the biggest weekly drop in nine months, as the US dollar strengthened to a seven-month high amid the expectation that interest rate rises are likely to rise by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan in Shanghai has depreciated 0.84 per cent against the greenback this week to hover around its lowest level since September 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall marks the biggest weekly drop since the week of January 8, when it lost 1.56 per cent. The offshore yuan in Hong Kong was down 0.43 per cent this week, extending the 0.47 per cent drop last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the Chinese currency held its ground, however, after the central bank strengthened the yuan fixing for the first time in eight days as the US dollar retreated from its seven-month high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan was flat at 6.7247 against the US dollar by 10 am, up only 1 basis point from a day earlier, while the offshore yuan in Hong Kong dipped 1 pip to 6.7339 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Friday set the yuan reference point at 6.7157 against the US dollar, up 139 basis points or 0.2 per cent than on Thursday, after the US dollar retreated from its seven-month high overnight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The prospect of the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raising rates in its December meeting and the still-significant capital outflow pressures in recent months may further weigh on the yuan," </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> wrote in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank expects the yuan fixing to reach 6.8 per dollar by the end of this year and 7.3 per dollar by the end of 2017, translating into 1.1 per cent and 8.5 per cent further depreciation against the US dollar from current levels.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan reacted quitely on Thursday morning after official data showed a continuing decline of its foreign reserves in November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan in Shanghai was 0.01 per cent or 9 basis points lower at 6.8789 as of 11.00am on Wednesday, while the offshore yuan in Hong Kong traded at 6.8929 to the US dollar at 11.00am, 0.04 per cent, or 26 basis points stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday set the yuan reference point against the US dollar at 6.8731, 77 basis points or 0.12 per cent stronger from its fixing Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent either side of the reference point for the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Figures published on Wednesday showed China's foreign exchange reserves fell by US$69.1 billion to US$3.05 trillion in November, the largest drop since January. And it marked the lowest level since March 2011. The forex reserves' decline result from China selling US dollars to defend the yuan against depreciation caused by capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, actual underlying outflows may have been larger," said UBS economist Wang Tao. "Yuan's depreciation and increased capital outflows have tightened domestic liquidity, which </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has been reluctant to fully offset."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow controls have been reportedly further tightened since late November, targeting mainly domestic companies' outbound investment and offshore lending. "We think controls can and will likely be tightened further, including higher reserve requirement on forward transactions and stricter document verification of foreign exchange transactions," Wang added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The euro strengthened for the second day, up 0.17 per cent to 1.077 against dollar ahead of </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1">'s policy meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reuters reported that the </span><span class="s3">ECB</span><span class="s1"> is expected to announce a six-month extension to its quantitative easing programme on Thursday, while keeping the size of asset purchases unchanged at 80 billion euros, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai for the first time issued yuan-denominated bonds in its free-trade zone (FTZ) on Thursday, a step that could help entice capital inflow as the city renews efforts to push the yuan as an international currency by embracing global investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move came after nearly three years of lacklustre operations in the free trade zone, which was supposed to be the testing ground for the country's major economic reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The three-year 3 billion-yuan (HK$3.4 billion) local government bonds were sold at a yield of 2.85 per cent and were 2.78 times oversubscribed, said the Finance Ministry in a statement on its website on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the first time that overseas banks - </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and DBS - have underwritten local government bonds, the ministry said.It enriches the market participants, enlarges the market scale, increases bond investment products and promotes the issuance of local government bondsWesley Yang, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wesley Yang, head of financial markets, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1"> China, said the issuance marks the start of the FTZ bond market - China's third onshore bond market after the interbank and exchange markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is significant to the China bond market development because it enriches the market participants, enlarges the market scale, increases bond investment products and promotes the issuance of local government bonds,” he said. Yang expects more fixed-income products - such as SDR bonds, denominated in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights currency - to be issued in the zone in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Qu, a markets economist at ANZ in Shanghai, said the yield, close to the top end of the bidding range of 2.26 per cent to 3.05 per cent, is largely in line with market expectations, though it is lower than the yield of bonds issued by the Finance Ministry in Hong Kong earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Authorities are mainly targeting building up the yuan bond market on the mainland via the trial in Shanghai FTZ,” he said. “But it's also true that the issuance could help attract capital inflow against the backdrop of growing capital outflow now.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The issuance comes at a time of heightened capital outflows as the yuan plumbs daily lows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has already launched a series of measures to curb the flow of money from the country, including beefing up checks on outbound deals' authenticity and making it more difficult to lend yuan overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, Zhang Xin, head of the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">'s Shanghai branch, told a government conference that the Shanghai free trade zone, the mainland's first Hong Kong-style free market place, would aim to redirect capital flows to achieve a net inflow in 2016, in line with the authorities' goal of stabilising the financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A veteran bonds trader who declined to be named said it is still too early to predict the growth potential of the scheme because of its relatively limited scale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bond is part of a combined 114.3 billion yuan in local government bonds sold by the Shanghai municipality this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A mature and established bond market with active participation from global investors is seen as an essential part of Beijing's moves to internationalise the yuan. Mainland companies also tap Hong Kong's dim sum bond market to obtain offshore yuan funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is gradually opening up its US$8.5 trillion bond market, but interest from abroad appears to be weak because of transparency concerns around the bond issuers and the rule of law.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The interbank funding cost of Chinese banks is quickly approaching, if not exceeding, the interest rate banks charge their clients, creating a distorted view of the financial landscape that could lead to some shrinkage in bank lending or a quick rise of interest rates in the world's second-biggest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-year Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks in the Shanghai wholesale money market, rose above the one-year prime loan rate, namely the interest rate banks charge to their best clients, on Monday and Tuesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shibor's 4.3024 reading was its highest in more than two years, and marked the first time the Shibor had exceeded the prime loan rate since the data series became available in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Money market rates in China have been rising for months, partly in response to the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s heading down a path to raise rates and a steady tightening by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">. Now the rate rise has started to spread; many banks already have cancelled discounted rates for mortgaged loans. On Friday, regulators demanded higher deposit rates from banks competing for their funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reversed gap between funding cost and interest charges will only accelerate the process for Chinese banks to raise interest rates on loans to home buyers, infrastructure projects and industrial enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu Min, a former deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Sunday that the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> has started a global liquidity tightening cycle and "a turning point" is emerging, the official Shanghai Securities News reported on its website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Interest rates will only go up and will not move downward, and the trend won't change," Zhu, a former deputy Chinese central bank governor, was quoted as saying.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When China's money market rates started to rise in March, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> issued a statement saying rate increases in open-market operations did not equal "benchmark interest rate increases", in an apparent effort to assuage market concerns over excessive tightening.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank, on the other hand, has steadily increased short-term lending rates in daily market liquidity operations, following the Fed's rate hikes in December and March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The gap of timing between </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s operation to adjust market rates and the Fed's rate hike is smaller," said Xie Yaxuan, chief economist with China Merchants Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The domestic rate hikes are the result of the follow-up moves by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> after the Fed's rate hikes and also due to the need to manage the economy - such as the need to deleverage and the tighter regulation on banks' capital adequacy," Xie said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">, one of the leading mortgage lenders, removed the discount it had offered to first-home buyers.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's exchange rate strategy is once again in the spotlight amid renewed talk of the need for a weaker currency as the central bank looks for effective tools to revive the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, market players argue that Beijing may continue to stick to a stable yuan strategy in order to meet its capital reform goals, even at the cost of hurting the economy in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A strong currency was one of the key factors to blame for unexpected tumbles in mainland imports and exports in April, with analysts having expected a rebound from depressed levels in February and March. </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> followed up with its third interest rate cut in six months on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has weakened by around 0.59 per cent against the US dollar since July. But the euro and yen, the currencies of the mainland's second- and third-biggest trading partners, have weakened against the greenback by 18 per cent and 15 per cent since then. As a result, the yuan has risen by around 13 per cent against a basket of US dollars, euros and yen in the period, according to DBS.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players say there could be a short-term correction for the yuan against the US dollar, with the central bank intervening less in the currency market by setting weaker benchmark midpoint prices. However, Beijing is seen as likely to embrace only relatively limited change in its currency strategy, at least until the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> completes its review of the currency's eligibility to join the special drawing rights (SDR) basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Short-term correction is highly likely, but people should not over read," DBS economist Nathan Chow said. "China would not join the currency war. The dynamics of Chinese exports are a lot different from a decade ago - more and more Chinese manufacturers are moving their production base outside the mainland and that means a stronger currency won't help them."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said DBS was working on raising its year-end target price for USD/CNY to a stronger level, with the US dollar likely to rise more slowly as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is expected to delay interest rate increases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan weakened by 0.03 per cent, or 19 basis points, to 6.2102 against the greenback yesterday, the weakest level in two weeks, while the offshore yuan lost 0.01 per cent, or 4 basis points, to 6.2117.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1"> economist Chang Jian said in December that the yuan was overvalued by 10 per cent to 15 per cent - which was dragging down economic growth by half a percentage point a year, yet Beijing seems to be tolerating this damage as the cost of opening up its capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another factor that might make the central bank reluctant to see a sharp decline in the yuan is the risk of capital outflow. The mainland's foreign exchange watchdog said in its annual report released yesterday that it would see "two-way moves" of capital flow in financial and capital accounts this year. The mainland's foreign reserves shrank by US$263 billion between July and March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market forces would seem to predict a lower yuan on the back of lower interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Normally, with interest rates being cut on the mainland and the United States expected to raise rates this year, there would be a natural weakening of demand for yuan and strengthening of demand for the US dollar, as mainland savings and government securities became relatively less appealing investments due to falling returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some market analysts said that spread impact might be limited due to the fact the mainland's capital markets were largely closed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China's capital account is still more closed than others, and hence the transmission between interest rates and FX is much looser than it may be for other currencies," </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> economists led by Qu Hongbin said. "In fact, if the policy easing improves investor sentiment because of better economic growth prospects, it may actually support the RMB broadly and offset the impact of reduced carry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The current calming of the USD bull run is creating balanced flow pressures for the renminbi, making both cyclical easing and structural reform more palatable in the near term."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> currency strategist Eddie Cheung echoed those sentiments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Currently, two factors are offsetting the negative FX impact from a rate cut," he said. "The first is the upcoming SDR review by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">, before which I think the central bank would like to keep the currency steady. The second is the market is taking it as a positive hint that the central bank is using additional measures to prop up the economy."</span></p>
