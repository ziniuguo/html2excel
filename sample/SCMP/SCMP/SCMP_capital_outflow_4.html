<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has denied devaluing its currency to weather the trade war and sent a veiled warning to “forces trying to short the yuan” after it weakened to a 22-month low against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, said the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which he heads, had “accumulated rich experiences and developed multiple policy tools” in defending the yuan, after the offshore exchange rate weakened to 6.97 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As for those forces trying to short the yuan, we have engaged directly a few years ago and we know each other very well,” Pan told a press briefing in Beijing. “I think our memories should still be fresh.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan did not name any individuals or institutions he believed were shorting - selling a currency, hoping for a decline in the market price - nor did he elaborate on how Beijing had “engaged directly with” such parties in the foreign exchange market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is China about to let the yuan weaken below seven to the dollar?[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2168180/china-about-let-yuan-weaken-below-seven-dollar]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those betting on a weaker yuan exchange rate are often viewed as unwelcome or even hostile by the Chinese government, which regards the yuan exchange rate not as a normal price indicator but as a symbol of China's economic health that must be defended.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fund managers and traders betting on a plunge in the Chinese currency's value akin to those of Argentina's peso or the Turkish lira have been left disappointed as China has kept the exchange rate under its control via direct market intervention, capital account controls and tweaks of trading rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Chinese fundamentals such as excessive money printing and economic deceleration offer reasons to bet on a weaker yuan, the exchange rate against the dollar has never weakened beyond 7 yuan to the dollar in the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ongoing trade war with the United States has again fanned expectations that the yuan would weaken and that Beijing may tolerate a modest depreciation to offset tariffs, to help exporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has lost about 10 per cent against the US dollar since April. The US' </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve Board</span><span class="s1"> is raising rates, while </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> is leaning towards monetary easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Pan reiterated on Friday that Beijing had no plans to allow a sharp fall in the yuan, would not engage in “competitive devaluation” and would not use its currency as a weapon in the trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is a responsible big country,” Pan said. “We are not going to competitively devalue [the yuan], we will not use the exchange rate as a tool to respond to trade conflict and market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The central bank has reiterated this many times. Today I will reiterate again.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump again accuses China of currency manipulation, contradicting his finance officials[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2160582/trump-again-accuses-china-currency-manipulation]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined to comment directly on yuan exchange levels but said the central bank had sufficient reserves to keep the exchange rate stable, adding that it still “reflects the supply and demand and movements in the international foreign exchange market”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pressures of capital outflow and yuan depreciation remain visible in China. According to data published by the exchange regulator yesterday, Chinese banks sold a net 110.3 billion yuan (US$15.9 billion) to companies and individuals in September, the highest since December 2016, in the latest sign that capital outflows are picking up amid weakness in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts at </span><span class="s3">Commerzbank</span><span class="s1"> wrote in a note published last week that 7 yuan to the dollar would be breached if China's trade conflict with the US lasts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When China suddenly devalued the yuan by 2 per cent in August 2015 during its stock market rout, it suffered a US$500 billion capital flight that year, raising fears of a Chinese financial meltdown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three years later, Pan said, the country's monetary authority was more experienced to keep a crisis at bay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">, said that despite high depreciation pressure, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was likely to keep the yuan stable ahead of the G20 leaders' annual summit next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US has made it clear a stable renminbi is a prerequisite [to settling the trade dispute],” said Liu, adding that there were only limited players shortening the yuan in the onshore market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan is set to record, after what has been a volatile trading year, its biggest annual drop in value since 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, as 2017 dawns experts generally agree the currency of the world's second largest economy is set to end the “6 era” - a period with an exchange rate between 6 and 7 against the US dollar - for the first time since April 2008, and enter a new “7 era”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2016 had started in dramatic fashion, with the offshore yuan tumbling nearly 600 basis points on January 4, and the currency is also set to end the year in similar mood.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday night, the onshore yuan broke the critical psychological level of 7 to the US dollar at 11pm, according to a price quoted by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The milestone scared a lot of people, including the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, which in an unusual move responded immediately, labelling the price quote “irresponsible”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figure eventually turned out to be mistake, but it did show just how easily the markets and the authorities can be spooked when the currency hovers close to 7 per US dollar, particularly after a extremely volatile period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is still inching closer to 7 per US dollar, quoted at 6.9493 and 6.9758 in the onshore and offshore markets, respectively, on Friday - the lowest levels in eight and a half years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's close to 7 per cent weaker against the greenback at the beginning of the year, marking the biggest annual loss since 1994, and down for the third year in a row.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The daily reference rate of the yuan set by the central bank was lowered by a total of 4,434 basis points, or 6.82 per cent to 6.9370 per US dollar on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has continued to depreciate since Donald Trump was unexpectedly elected the next President of the United States, which analysts say have increasing expectations of inflationary pressure due to the massive potential fiscal spending he promised during his campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> has since dropped its interest rates, with at least one further cut expected by the market next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That prospect has driven the US Dollar Index, which gauges the value of greenback, about 6 per cent higher since the election, following a 2 per cent rise in the three months prior to the vote.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the index fell to its weakest level in more than two weeks on Friday, many said they expected the strengthening trend to continue in 2017, which in turn will put further pressure on the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> has forecast the Chinese currency to keep falling against the greenback, tipping 7.2 yuan to the US dollar by the end of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank expects the weakness to be most severe in the first two quarters of the year, which may prompt mainlanders to make early use of their US$50,000 annual foreign exchange ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Bloomberg survey shows analysts' median forecast for the yuan is to end 2017 at 7.15 against the dollar, offering a 63 per cent chance of it hitting 7 by the end of the first quarter, which would be a four-fold increase in the probability offered three months ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan's discount to the onshore exchange rate, seen as a gauge of traders' bearishness on the currency, expanded to the most since December 13 on an intraday basis on Thursday, as traders sold the currency on bets of stronger depreciation pressures as the year draws to an end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency's ongoing bleak outlook has been forcing local individuals and businesses to reduce their exposure to yuan-denominated assets and rush into US dollar-denominated ones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves, meanwhile, shrank by around a quarter from US$3.99 trillion in June 2014 to US$3.05 trillion in November, and the country was displaced in October by Japan as America's top foreign creditor, as the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> spent more of its reserves to defend the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The steady decline in foreign exchange reserves prompted Yu Yongding, a former advisor to the PBOC, to suggest that once reserves fall below a certain psychological threshold, capital outflows are almost certainly to accelerate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu said China has from now until president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration to steady the foreign exchange market, and allow the yuan to depreciate to a fair and more natural level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank, however, seems wary of triggering any further strong depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday changed the way it will calculate a key yuan index in the new year, nearly doubling the number of foreign currencies in a basket that is used to set the currency's value to 24, from 13. The weighting of the US dollar within that basket will be lowered to 22.43 per cent from the current 26.43 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the change was in line with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s hope of discouraging investors from exclusively tracking its fluctuations, but added that it would have limited impact on the Chinese currency, which they still expect to weaken further against the dollar next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This means the central bank will pay more attention to the RMB's stability against a basket of currencies,” analysts at CEBM Group said in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities have rolled out policies over the past two months to tighten its grip on capital outflows, including restricting mainlanders' purchase of insurance and investment products in Hong Kong, which were considered an increasingly popular channel for capital outflow. It has also imposed restrictions on Chinese companies' remittances overseas.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After declining for three consecutive days following Beijing's shock devaluation, the yuan strengthened on Friday following soothing words from </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> that suggested the authorities are not planning any further devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A day after </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> deputy governor Yi Gang said the authorities would act "when the market's volatility is excessive", the central bank raised the yuan's reference rate for the first time since Tuesday's devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan (CNY) gained 0.11 per cent, or 70 basis points, to finish the week at 6.3912 against the US dollar, while offshore yuan strengthened 0.4 per cent, or 260 basis points, to 6.4378.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing this week introduced a new market-driven currency mechanism in which the daily reference point - the midpoint of the yuan's exchange rate with the dollar from which it can rise or fall 2 per cent - is based on the previous day's close, That has led onshore yuan to lose 2.9 per cent, or 1,815 basis points, over the past week. Offshore yuan has lost 3.6 per cent, or 2,248 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some regional currencies also fell this week, triggering concerns about a fresh currency war in Asia. Since Tuesday, both the Singapore dollar and the South Korean won have lost 1.5 per cent, the Taiwan dollar is down 1.6 per cent while the Australian dollar has lost 0.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some fund managers and analysts believe although there could be downward pressure on the exchange rate this year, a sharp depreciation is unlikely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While a big [10 per cent] CNY devaluation is not justified, the central bank is now putting greater emphasis on the CNY's trade-weighted value, and a combination of factors argue for a drop of 'around 3 per cent'. This adjustment may be close to complete, by our estimates," said Eddie Cheung, an analyst at </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Why would the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> allow the currency to depreciate further to risk triggering capital outflows? We expect [the yuan] to reach its new equilibrium at around 6.40 to 6.50 to the dollar," BlackRock fund manager Tan Suanjin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the general outlook that the worst is over and there is limited downside for the currency, yuan-denominated products are under pressure to raise returns in order to retain customers. Dim sum bonds have seen yields surge as investors demand higher compensation in the wake of the yuan's sharp depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore commercial banks are kicking off another cycle of raising yuan deposit rates to retain liquidity, underscoring outflow pressure from Hong Kong's yuan deposit pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, Hong Kong's secretary for financial services and the treasury, said on Friday the scenario of some capital outflow from the city as a result of the devaluation should not be discounted and that Hong Kong was ready to handle such a situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although CNH (offshore yuan) will likely stay volatile for a while, CNH deposits still generate a good carry yield of around 3 per cent," </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analyst Heng Koonhow said. "So I would expect CNH deposits to gradually grow over the longer run ... only when there is good liquidity and a deep offshore pool of investable CNH assets, can the convergence in CNH and CNY be done more efficiently."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When mainland conglomerates look abroad for investment opportunities, the temptation of trophy assets can be irresistible. But the long-term investment can be problematical. A salutary lesson is to be drawn from the experience of Japan decades ago after a corporate shopping spree for overseas property and leisure assets led to capital outflows that caused problems for its economy. China has reached a tipping point in a corporate go-global splurge once encouraged by Beijing, but now prompting it to ban or restrict investments in leisure and property assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worries about the scale of capital outflows, particularly in property, have been compounded by companies borrowing at home to buy overpriced overseas assets, with implications for the stability of the mainland banking system in the event of market fluctuations. As a result, Beijing has intervened to order checks on credit exposure and shift the emphasis to investment in hi-tech, research, logistics and infrastructure projects linked to the "Belt and Road Initiative" - the state's preferred go-global strategy. Just this week, developer Dalian Wanda Group backed away from a £470 million (HK$4.7 billion) acquisition of a London development site. It remains to be seen whether encouragement to invest at home in state-owned enterprises is effective in reforming them as well as reining in the biggest firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retreat in outbound property investment could create headwinds for prices in Hong Kong, especially for office assets. However, that reckons without the ability of mainland firms to boost overseas currency assets by issuing debt or equity abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, analysts say the new outbound investment rules could bring benefits to Hong Kong, such as lower land prices and financial support for technology and infrastructure. Officials say the city is well placed to support the "Belt and Road Initiative", through technology, trade and commerce, logistics and financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coming after the Beidaihe summit of party leaders and ahead of a leadership reshuffle at the 19th Communist Party congress later this year, the redirection of outbound investment sends important policy signals. The latest controls on capital outflow reflect determination to put the economy back on track and curtail irrational overseas investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It reinforces President Xi Jinping's concern that financial stability is crucial to national security. At this pivotal time in the globalisation of the Chinese economy, overseas investments by mainland companies should be positive for the country's economy. This is a timely reminder. It gives the economy better direction that is also good for Hong Kong, especially in terms of a rational property market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stocks in industry leaders on the mainland A-share market have surged by 57 per cent in the first 11 months this year, and this rally is likely to continue in 2018 as market consolidation goes on, said analysts at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have picked the biggest caps in each of the 28 industries categorised by data provider Wind for a study, and found that they rose by about 57 per cent on average year to day, largely outperforming the benchmark," said Chen Li, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">'s China strategist, in a forum in Shenzhen on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rally is likely to continue into 2018, although I would prefer leaders in the segment markets rather than the big first-tier names in big industries," he said, adding that as China continues to push for supply-side reform, which favours bigger industry players while forcing smaller ones out, the big caps will continue to enjoy a rising market share and better business returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has this year gained around 8.6 per cent - by Friday's close it was at 3371.7 - while industry leaders have been rising at a faster pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kweichow Moutai, China's biggest distiller, saw its share price rocket up to 639.2 yuan (US$96.4), up by 91 per cent from 334 yuan in 2016, becoming the most eye-catching blue chip in Shanghai this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mutual funds' weighting of ChiNext, the Shenzhen-based listing of smaller tech companies, has continued the fall since the beginning of this year due to low market risk appetite, tight market liquidity and ChiNext's earnings growth slowing down, Gao Ting, the head of China Strategy at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> wrote in a note on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"During the third quarter, mutual fund investors in the A-share market have been outweighing in beverage, non-ferrous metals and electronics, followed by property developers, banks and insurers …</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We continue to see upside potential for banks. We prefer large banks with adequate capital and low balance-sheet risk, which may benefit from a better non-performing loan ratio," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with the A-share market, the Hong Kong equity market has been undergoing a bigger rally, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index rising by 30 per cent to 28603.6 by Friday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caixin on Wednesday quoted a source close to the State Council as saying that Beijing was considering picking two companies for a pilot and making their non-tradeable shares free-floating, a move that will make the so-call H-share companies - incorporated on the mainland but listed on the offshore Hong Kong market - more liquid.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this will have a limited impact on Hong Kong's secondary market due to its size, and will largely boost the financing ability of the H-share companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, there are 225 H-share companies on the main board. Some of these also have a listed unit on the mainland, making them "unlikely to sell shares in Hong Kong due to the significant A/H premium", analysts with BofA Merrill Lynch wrote in a note on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If all H shares were to become tradeable after the trial, we estimate that owners of less than US$122 billion worth of H shares may be tempted to sell at some point. Although this may put pressure on certain stocks, overall market impact should be limited given the relatively small scale. The move should add to the Hong Kong market's attraction as an IPO destination for mainland companies,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">thus a small positive for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A similar message has been sent out a few times, said Nicole Yuen, the head of North Asia equities at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, while "capital outflow would remain a key concern for regulators if they are really going to push it out".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The full convertibility of pre-IPO shares allows founders or major shareholders of mainland companies to float their shares on the Hong Kong bourse, where non-Chinese investors can trade in them without being qualified investors on the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would test the country's management of capital flow, as the selling of shares on the offshore market will convert equities into offshore capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">'s Li, however, said selling of shares may not be the only option for major holders of H-share listed mainland companies, if they want to raise money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Making all the shares fully circulated will help the mainland companies borrow more money with lower rates from banks, by stake pledging - they do not have to sell the stake. It makes a huge difference in lending if the stake you pledge is liquid," he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overnight borrowing cost of offshore yuan in Hong Kong's interbank market has been set at its highest rate in almost a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for offshore yuan, known as the CNH Hibor, was fixed by the Treasury Markets Association (TMA) at 38.33 per cent on Thursday, the highest level since January 13, 2016. That's more than double the 16.95 per cent fix on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overnight, the offshore yuan surged the most in a year as traders scrambled to square their short positions, while the Chinese central government continues to tighten measures to control capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Chinese policy makers were likely to order state-owned enterprises to sell foreign currency for yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, said the tightening of liquidity in offshore yuan is likely to be the result of "an intervention by </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> played the same trick last January and September -- by suddenly draining the offshore yuan market, it immediately pushed up yuan's borrowing costs and hit the speculators," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan bears usually borrow the currency in the offshore market to build their short positions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the liquidity drain in Hong Kong will not sustain for long," Yao said, adding that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would not want to kill the offshore market, but would use the tactic as a way to deter speculators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overnight, the offshore yuan soared 1.3 per cent or 930 basis points to hit 6.866 per dollar, breaching several psychologically important levels. The change marked its biggest percentage gain in about a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It continued to strengthen fast on Thursday and had broken the 6.8 level to stand at 6.7870 by 2.42pm, while onshore yuan was trading at 6.8729 against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Policy makers in Beijing have recently introduced a slew of measures to tighten control of the currency market, including placing higher scrutiny on citizens' conversion quotas and stricter requirements for banks reporting cross-border transactions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's insurance sector is likely to come under increased pressure after Beijing tightened its scrutiny of individual foreign currency purchases at the start of the new year in a bid to further restrict capital outflows, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's insurance companies were already feeling the pinch from a raft of earlier measures designed to make it harder for mainlanders to purchase insurance products as a way of hedging against the declining yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of January 1, 2017, individuals are required to explain the purpose of their foreign currency purchases at Chinese banks and provide additional information, according to a recent announcement by the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), the country's top currency regulator.We expect more material impact on the business Chinese tourists bring to Hong Kong insurersJenny Jiang, analyst, Morgan Stanley</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Specifically, individuals are restricted from using foreign currencies in overseas investments, including property, securities, life insurance products and investment-related insurance purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect Hong Kong's insurance industry to feel the effects of the latest measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We expect more material impact on the business Chinese tourists bring to Hong Kong insurers, given the fresh restrictions on outbound personal investments," said Jenny Jiang, an equity analyst for Morgan Stanley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The new rules for 2017 not only make US dollars less accessible to individuals but also effectively prevent customers from using the onshore banking system to pay for cross-border insurance premiums."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the rules, the annual cap of US$50,000 for each person seeking to sell yuan remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the process has become more restrictive and complicated, said analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although there are still other ways of making the insurance payment, this move could dampen interest in and demand for Hong Kong insurance policies to a certain extent, as customers may see the</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">transaction as too risky and too complicated, " Jiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, it could make renewal payment more difficult and lead to surrenders in extreme cases, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts from </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> said the latest measures were "a clear reaction" to the yuan's recent weakness and the government's mounting concern about capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurance stocks hammered as China tries to slow capital outflows through Hong Kong insurance purchases[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2041560/insurance-stocks-hammered-china-tries-slow-capital-outflows]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, the authorities are worried that there will be a rush to buy foreign currencies in the early months of 2017, as Chinese people try to use their US$50,000 quota for the year before the yuan weakens further or additional tightening measures are introduced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be some sectors which could face a more fundamental impact on their business under this new measure, most notably insurance companies that rely heavily on business from mainland customers as well as Macau gaming operations," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analysts expect the government to introduce more capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Indeed, the current measure is only a relative measure, as the level of the individual quota has not been removed. Therefore, if the RMB continues to weaken, whether this measure will be really effective in containing capital outflow remains doubtful. In this case, one should not be surprised if more capital account control measures follow," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Share prices of Hong Kong-based insurers have been under pressure since last year, as China gradually tightened capital controls to stabilise the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors have poured into Hong Kong's insurance sector in recent years as they try to skirt strict capital controls to move money offshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, the Chinese authorities banned UnionPay cardholders from buying investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong and launched a probe into illegal sales of overseas insurance policies on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, the largest life insurer in the city, has slid 20 per cent from its peak in October. It fell 0.5 per cent to close at HK$43.55 on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The uncertainty facing the Chinese tourist business has been a key overhang on AIA's share price since last year as China gradually tightens capital controls to stabilize its currency," Jiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, she said the policy risk has been "largely reflected" in AIA's current share price and the company's fundamentals still look attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jiang still put an "overweight" rating on the stock, but cited downside risks such as potential regulatory changes, particularly in relation to capital and consumer protection.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said on Thursday the first interest rate increase by the city in almost a decade will lead to some of the US$130 billion in hot money flowing out of the territory and boost the cost for homeowners here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said the city's central bank does not intend to relax any of the tough mortgage measures imposed by the authority in the past few years that were aimed at cooling down the sizzling property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The interest rate rise will add cost for the homeowners to repay their mortgage loans. It would have an impact on the property market. However, we have not yet seen any sign the property market is on a downtrend cycle. As such, we have no plans to relax the mortgage policies that were aimed at safeguarding the risks face by banks," he said in a media briefing on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA early on Thursday raised the base rate by 25 basis points from 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent, the first official rate rise in the city in almost a decade, matching the decision of the US Fed to also increase interest rates for the first time since 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the arrangement in which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, HKMA will change its official rate alongside any interest rate movement in the US. The base rate is the discount window rate charged to commercial banks to get funding from the HKMA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have a very prolonged period of a low interest environment and the monetary easing policy in the US has led to US$130 billion in inflows to the city over the past few years. Since the US has started to normalise its interest rate cycle, some of the money will leave but the pace will depend on the speed of the US interest rate rise next year. If the rate rise is slow and gradual, the capital outflow from Hong Kong would not happen too soon," Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While an outflow may hurt the local stock and property market, Chan believes Hong Kong could absorb the shock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong banking sector is liquid. As long as the public would carefully prepare for the interest rate rise, we should be able to cope. We have enjoyed a low interest rate for too long and it will take time for us to accept interest rate to go to a normal level," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A low interest rate may lead the assets into becoming too hot...so an interest rate rise would help the property market to have healthy development for a longer term," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the HKMA has no intention to change the peg to the US dollar even though it means the city could not independently determine its interest rate policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The peg has served Hong Kong well as a small economy. The HKMA has no intention to change the peg," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the HKMA will defend the peg when the Hong Kong dollar weakens to the 7.85 to the US dollar level. The last time the authority need to prevent the dollar from falling through this level was 10 years ago. The Hong Kong dollar is currently trading near the top end of the peg at 7.75.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commercial banks could decide if they want to increase the interest rate for their deposits or loan rates immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The last cut in Hong Kong's base rate took place on December 17, 2008 from 1.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent, and the last hike in base rate took place on June 30, 2006 from 6.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holding the world's biggest foreign reserves, an enormous domestic market fuelled by sharply rising consumption demand, Beijing has a huge say when to open its capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the pace for further movements will still be subject to how the global financial markets rebalance, especially after the US Fed announced on Wednesday its first rate hike in almost a decade, analysts said. The Fed decided to raise rates by 25 basis points overnight in its first rate increase since 2006, while its statement indicated gradual increases will come along as the US economy strengthens further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As you can tell from the process of China joining the SDR, China is highly competent in sticking to its own agenda when engaging in the global market, compared to decades ago when it applied for membership in the </span><span class="s3">WTO</span><span class="s1">," said Li-Gang Liu, China economist at Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SDR, or the Special Drawing Rights, refers to the reserve currency basket under the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> on November 30 agreed to add the Chinese currency yuan to this basket, after it judged the yuan as "freely usable", a criteria China failed to reach during its first application in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a contentious evaluation, and analysts argue about whether yuan is qualified for membership, given the currency is neither fully convertible, nor free floating. It was also the first change in the SDR since 1999, when the euro replaced the deutsche mark and French franc.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In comparison, it took 16 years for China to become the 143rd member of the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organization</span><span class="s1"> in 2001. To facilitate the negotiation, Beijing assented to accept a China-specific safeguard, effective until 2013, allowing other members to take action against any import from China that caused market disruption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would not doubt policy makers' willingness to enhance renminbi's convertibility and opening up more capital account items," said Helen Qiao, greater China chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, considering the market reactions, especially after the central bank adjusted the exchange rate mechanism on August 11, and the general instability of the global financial markets with the anxiety due to Fed's rate hike, this whole process could potentially drag, and the capital account liberalisation process may also be pushed back in 2016, she noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the view the US Fed was going to increase rates earlier in the year, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> devalued the yuan by almost 2 per cent on August 11 by raising the official mid price, which took the market by surprise, and Beijing later explained the move as a way to relax controls on the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move was also largely taken by analysts as an official recognition of the yuan devaluation, as the US dollar picked up strong momentum afterward.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign-exchange reserves declined last month to its lowest level since February 2013 amid heavy capital outflows, and as the central bank sold dollars to prevent a further steep drop in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency hoard dropped by US$87.2 billion to US$3.44 trillion at the end of November, from US$3.53 trillion a month earlier, according to </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> data released in early December. The total decline this year has already hit US$405 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his speech in Washington in an </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> meeting this April, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan pledged to launch two schemes in 2015 that would free currently inconvertible items under the capital account - one is QDII 2, which allows cross-border investment by individuals; the other is the Shenzhen -- Hong Kong stock connect, which enables international investors to trade in the domestic stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But neither of the two schemes has started at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yimin, an economist with Shenwan Hongyuan Securities based in Beijing, said the major drags lie in internal and external "uncertainties".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The authorities' concerns are that the Shenzhen connect may be embarrassed by low participation, particularly after the stock market rout in summer. As for QDII2, they might be waiting for a better launching time, to buffer the capital outflow pressure triggered by the Fed's rate hike."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Once things get stabilised. The schemes will be kicked off quickly," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital markets will be "much more accessible" by the year 2020, as the commitment to further open up capital accounts is irreversible after China joined the SDR, said Liu of ANZ</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This July, China had opened its US$5.7 trillion interbank bond market to foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said China should consider introducing more long-term funds to the market, for instance, allowing the US$36 trillion worth of global pension funds access to the bond market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing wants to make the yuan an "international currency" by 2020, and further loosen the management over foreign exchange to facilitate cross-border capital movement for individuals and companies, according to an article written by Governor Zhou in the People's Daily in late November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China's longest-serving central bank chief who has been sitting on the chair since 2002, Zhou is one of the most powerful names in the pro-reform camp and closely connected to the party's core decision making body.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The target to "gradually realise the convertibility of yuan" was also highlighted in the 13th five-year plan proposal, issued in late October after top party leaders sketched out the blueprint for China's next five-year development plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The year 2020 will be crucial as China is due to completes it 13th five-year plan by then, and celebrate the 100th founding anniversary for the ruling Communist Party in the next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it is worth noting that the concept of capital account convertibility held by the Chinese leadership is distinct from others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his speech in Washington this April, Zhou said the capital account convertibility China has targeted "is not based on the traditional concept of being fully or freely convertible".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, drawing lessons from the global financial crisis, China will adopt a concept of "managed convertibility", by using "macroprudential measures" to limit risks from cross-border capital flows and to maintain the stable value of the currency and a safe financial environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"On the global stage, I do not think it is too challenging for China to retain its own agenda. The bigger problem comes from internal - it is much harder to break the deadlocks in the domestic system, particularly when it hurts the interest groups," said Liu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US decision to raise interest rates will have some impact on China's trade, but how much is not immediately known, the </span><span class="s3">Chinese commerce ministry</span><span class="s1"> said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> hiked interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"[The Fed rate hike] will have some direct or indirect impact on China's external trade and international investments. Further analysis is required to determine the extent," ministry spokesman Shen Danyang said at a regular press briefing held on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Stock Exchange gained 1.5 per cent in the morning trading session after Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen's widely-expected decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> set the daily yuan mid-price weaker for the ninth day running at 6.4757 against the US dollar before the yuan weakened further in the morning trading session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost everyone has been expecting the Fed to act and China's stock investors have been factoring this in for a long time as well," said Luo Yi, the chief analyst at Huatai Securities. "When it happened, it's quite natural to see China's stock prices rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's nothing to be feared. In the last rate hike cycle of the Fed, the Hong Kong stock market continued to boom - it's not necessarily right to say that a Fed rate hike will be a curse for emerging markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> entered its rate hike cycle in 2004, China was the world's No.6 economy, its financial market was largely closed to the outside world and Beijing could be fairly relaxed about the Fed's decisions. China has lost that luxury today, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the last Fed rate cycle, China was still in the back seat, watching the Fed move from afar and probably wondering how central banking works, but now China is in the forefront," said Sun Lijian, a finance professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. "It has to face possible results from any major move in the outside world - that's a new territory for China's policy makers."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun said China, now the world's second biggest economy, was much more exposed to global capital flow risks, despite its capital controls.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaignIt's not necessarily right to say that a Fed rate hike will be a curse for emerging marketsLuo Yi, financial analyst</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the Fed first mouthed the word "tapering" in 2013, it partly triggered a cash crunch in the onshore interbank with the overnight rate soaring to 13.4 per cent; then there was a stock market crash and yuan exchange rate turbulence - both linked to money flows and market expectations influenced by the Fed move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed in June cited financial market volatility in emerging markets and China's economic slowdown as reasons for not raising interest rates that month. Since then China has arrested people blamed for contributing to a stock market crash, allowed the yuan to fall to the lowest level in four years versus the dollar and announced again that the yuan will de-peg the dollar to follow a basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts at </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1"> led by Jiang Chao wrote in a research note that the Fed's rate decision marked "an official turning point of global liquidity" and would add to depreciation pressure on the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed's rate hike would "add pressure of capital outflow and yuan depreciation for China" and narrow the room for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to lower interest rates, they wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, China has to cut required reserve ratio to offset capital outflows. "We must deal with it from various fronts, first of all, we have to stabilise the domestic economy," the analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dollar traded near its weakest level in 17 months, reflecting an increasingly nervous market ahead of the upcoming </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> policy meeting and expectations that the timing of a rate rise in the city may be brought forward.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency fell as low as 7.7985 per dollar on Tuesday, its weakest level since January 2016 and down from an intra-day level of 7.8004 on Monday. Under the linked exchange rate system, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), the city's de facto central bank, is obliged to buy and sell US dollars to prevent the currency from breaching either side of a trading band between 7.75 and 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Markets are pricing in a 25 basis points increase in the US Fed Fund target rate to 1.25 per cent on Wednesday that would be the fourth rate rise since December 2015. The HKMA has increased its base rate three times since 2015, in lock step with the Fed to maintain the currency's peg with the US dollar.Hong Kong commercial banks will need to raise mortgage rates this time after the Fed's rate hike if they want to avoid greater pressure on the currencyJasper Lo, chief strategist, King International Financial</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong's dollar has weakened this year because commercial banks in the city have been keeping their prime rate at 5 per cent, reluctant to raise their bank rates. As the US dollar interest rate has climbed while the city's bank rates remained low, the widening interest rate differential has led to selling of Hong Kong dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has unveiled eight rounds of property tightening measures since 2014 but housing affordability remains one of the gravest issues facing the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four major Hong Kong banks including </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> raised their Hibor-linked mortgage rate in May but lenders still have little room to increase mortgage rates because of intense competition in the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consequently, the Hong Kong dollar is likely to remain under pressure, which may cause a clean break from the 7.80 level, according to Jasper Lo, chief strategist at King International Financial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Historically, the HKMA would buy Hong Kong dollars when the currency fell to 7.83, rather than waiting for it reach the 7.85 lower limit of the trading band.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there is no threat to the Hong Kong dollar peg arrangement for the forseeable future because foreign reserves stand at US$396 billion, such action by the HKMA would probably shrink those reserves as well as domestic money supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong commercial banks will need to raise mortgage rates this time after the Fed's rate hike if they want to avoid greater pressure on the currency that would cause market volatility to spread," Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interbank rates soared in 1998, as foreign reserves fell and the domestic money supply shrank. The HKMA took some unorthodox steps, such as buying Hong Kong stocks as the Hang Seng index plunged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A research note by strategist Ken Cheung at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1"> said Hong Kong's local banks and regulators will be aware of capital outflow risk and will consider lifting rates earlier, before the local currency hits 7.85 level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A surprisingly hawkish Fed at its policy meeting could push forward the timing of rate increase in Hong Kong and would probably trigger a deeper correction in local financial markets, Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some of the world's biggest banks and fund managers believe the renminbi is almost a shoe in to get into the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s elite currency basket this year, Beijing doesn't seem to feel that inclusion is in the bag.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the detailed 13th five-year plan released this week after the ruling Communist Party plenum, a brief line caught the attention of Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the all-encompassing blueprint spanning the next five years, "pushing for the renminbi to join the Special Drawing Rights" has been engraved. Such a goal was not carved into the 12th five-year plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This shows that not even at the top government level is there firm confidence for an inclusion at the review this month. Otherwise, why would they list it as a working item for the next five years?" Yeung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government confession of doubt, albeit crafted in a nuanced manner, stands in stark contrast with the widespread sanguine attitude of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's biggest banks and money managers have upped the decibel level in championing the renminbi's bid for SDR membership, a synthetic quasi-currency used as the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s account unit and rarely seen in financial transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1"> said the Chinese currency had a "more than 90 per cent chance"; </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> said it was almost a sure case that the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> executive board would give its nod on the application. </span><span class="s3">AXA Investment</span><span class="s1"> Managers, which overseas some 694 billion euros (HK$5.9 trillion), assigned an 80 per cent chance for inclusion in the November review, 15 per cent for a delay to 2016, and only a 5 per cent chance to miss the cut till 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the market chorus, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has yet to reveal the date on which its executive board will meet and review the basket's composition, which happens once every five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday, a report by the mainland's China Business News said the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> had delayed the date of the review from November 4th to the 30th. The report prompted the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> to rebut the report and reiterated the November time frame to discuss the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The exact board meeting date will be communicated once it has been set," the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has already delayed it once. I wouldn't be surprised if the day of November 30th slipped through without a decision being announced," said Yeung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> in early August delayed the effective date for a potential inclusion from the beginning of 2016 to September 30 of that year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining the SDR, now consisting of the dollar, euro, pound and yen, is viewed as a confidence boost to the yuan's status as a reserve currency, as well as being acknowledged as"freely usable", a milestone that would crown Beijing's long pursuit of internationalising its currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aidan Yao, senior emerging market economist at AXA Investment Managers, estimated that the yuan would be granted a 14 per cent weight in the SDR basket, vaulting past the share of the pound (11.3) and the yen (9.4) and trailing only the dollar (41.9) and euro (37.4).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, senior vice president for foreign exchange at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, the oldest private bank in the US, said his hunch was that the renminbi would be given a weight between 5 to 7, just under that of the yen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The potential issues arising from the treatment of Hong Kong's offshore yuan, the CNH, market may speak for a lower weight for the CNY," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> in its August report said the treatment of Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions and Taiwan "presents methodological issues for the computation of some indicator", such as whether transactions between mainland China and the other three regions shall be considered as international.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Chandler, similar to a lot of other currency and economic experts, thinks that the renminbi has "a good chance to get in". "It's a gradual process. First, get into the door, then gradually increase the weight as China's reserve share grows and [capital market] accessibility is enhanced," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao at </span><span class="s3">AXA</span><span class="s1"> estimated that in the most optimistic scenario, some US$600 billion capital will flow into China from supranational, official and private investors between 2016 and 2020, on the condition that the renminbi joins the SDR and that Beijing continues to open up access for private investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some US$40 billion, representing a 14 per cent share of the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s US$280 billion SDR portfolio, will be allocated by the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">. Another US$360 billion will be snapped up by foreign central banks, assuming that the renminbi accounts for 5 per cent of global reserves by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some US$200 billion will be bought by private investors, accounting for a 1 per cent share in the US$20 trillion portfolios around the world that tracks the Citi World Government Bond Index, which Yao used as a proxy for his calculation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Such capital inflow will counterbalance the capital outflow we have seen in China over the past year," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Sunac China Holdings</span><span class="s1">, one of China's largest property developers, denied a media report that China Huarong Asset Management was temporarily suspending new loans to the company amid tightening regulatory scrutiny, and warned it may take legal action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg had reported on Tuesday that Huarong's risk department had ordered a suspension of any new loans to Sunac that had not already been signed, effective September 18, citing an internal email its reporters had seen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The email called for heightened risk monitoring and attention to existing loans to Sunac, citing the developer's high gearing and debt as well as the regulator's increased focus on its rapid expansion, the Bloomberg report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have verified the matter with Huarong and they said they had never received any regulatory requirements concerning, or notices against, Sunac," </span><span class="s3">Sunac China</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement on Wednesday.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's economic policies were "completely able to adapt" to </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> interest rate rises, the foreign exchange regulator has said, adding the nation's economic fundamentals supported a stable capital base in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Chunying, spokeswoman of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on Thursday the Fed's rate increase in December had only a short-term effect on cross-border capital flows for China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the country saw capital outflows in the first quarter, the pressure had gradually eased and the yuan's exchange rate had stabilised, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies and individuals were repaying foreign debt at a slower pace than before and were less willing to hold foreign currencies, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since March, the market has formed a much clearer judgement on the path of the Fed's rate hikes," Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market believed the United States would ease back on pumping the rate, but maintain an eye on the impact of global financial markets on the American economy, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market's tolerance for risk was growing, while the strength of the US dollar was weakening, she said, noting the index measuring the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies dropped 5 per cent across February and March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's exchange rate had "started to stabilise", and China's cross-border capital flows had "returned to normal" to reflect economic fundamentals.Policies are completely able to adapt to the normalisation of the Fed's monetary policyWang Chunying, spokeswoman, </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The established economic and financial policies are completely able to adapt to the normalisation of the Fed's monetary policy," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China was under pressure to defend its currency and counter capital outflow following the Fed's rate increase at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign exchange reserves fell by about US$100 billion in December and January amid market jitters about the weakening yuan and a dimming outlook on growth in the world's second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the drain on reserves ended last month, rising by US$10.3 billion in March, to hit US$3.31 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said Beijing's overall policies would maintain the market's confidence in China's economic and reform direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the government would further promote currency reform along market lines, without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang also said the gap between the onshore and offshore yuan exchange rate narrowed in the first quarter. She didn't rule out the possibility of short-term, unexpected shocks to capital flows, but said the situation wouldn't affect long-term trends.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong insurers may be hit hard after a Chinese regulator for the industry warned mainland</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">residents on Friday about the risks of purchasing insurance products in Hong Kong, a city that became popular last year for mainlanders seeking Hong Kong- or US-dollar policies as the yuan weakened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the warning is to defend local insurers which lost business as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) </span><span class="s1">issued a statement on its website that said insurance products issued by Hong Kong insurers were not protected by mainland laws. It highlighted the legal fees for any insurance disputes are higher in the city. It also said policies bought in Hong Kong would face exchange-rate risks while Hong Kong has no regulation on dividend payment or cash values.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Policyholders would not get anything back if they surrendered their Hong Kong insurance policies within two years after the purchase,” the CIRC said. “The Hong Kong Insurance Claims Complaint Bureau can only handle compensation up to HK$1 million.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statement came just a few days after China Life issued a profits warning that its first half year result may drop 55 per cent to 60 per cent compared with the same period the year before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By contrast, AIA, the largest life insurer in Hong Kong, said on Friday that new business in its financial first quarter was worth US$578 million. That's an annual 36 per cent increase for the three months to the end of February and exceeded analysts' estimates of 18 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The contrast in results came after mainlanders spent HK$31.6 billion, or 24.2 per cent of the total new premiums of all life policies sold in Hong Kong last year, up from just 6 per cent in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurers said mainlanders like to come to Hong Kong to buy US- and Hong Kong-dollar policies to escape the exchange loss in light of the yuan's weakening. The Chinese currency dropped 5.6 per cent against the US dollar last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The CIRC warning shows the mainland regulator wants to defend mainland insurers which lost business to Hong Kong insurance companies when there are an increasing number of mainlanders now buying insurance products in Hong Kong,' Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector in the city, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We wish the mainland regulator wouldn't intervene in free-market competition. It should let the customers decide what products suit them best,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers Chief Executive Peter Tam said the CIRC only wanted to give a risk alert to mainlanders when they purchase policies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong Man-bun, Ben Kwong Man-bun, executive director of KGI Asia, said the CIRC warning came as the country worried about capital outflows due to the high amount of mainland money going into life policies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing in February curbed mainlanders' ability to use credit cards to pay for their policies in Hong Kong by instituting a US$5,000 cap.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The warning of CIRC comes as there are serious capital outflow problems in China. It is natural the country wants to discourage overseas insurance purchases,” Kwong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An insurance executive who did not want to be named said mainlanders have been big spenders for local insurance policies since last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would hit sales hard if China further curbs mainlanders' ability to buy insurance policies here. However, since there are still worries over the devaluation of the yuan against the US dollar, the mainlanders are likely to continue to buy policies in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever the United States does, the world takes notice. The Republican tax reform, led by the Trump White House, may be driven by purely domestic concerns but US trading partners, particularly China, are paying close attention. For those countries, capital outflow is a major worry. The most significant tax cut in three decades in the US may trigger a global race to slash taxes to compete for capital. This will particularly concern China, where tax income accounts for up to 80 per cent of fiscal revenue. Premier Li Keqiang has already made tax reform part of his policy agenda, with 1 trillion yuan (HK$1.18 trillion) to be slashed from corporate taxes. But the US move will add new pressure on the central government to act.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two different tax bills that have been passed in the </span><span class="s3">US Senate</span><span class="s1"> and House of Representatives still have to be harmonised before President Donald Trump can sign them into law. So it will take some time to gauge the effects of the tax cut on US competitiveness, productivity and workers' wages and the impact on the global economy. But Chinese policymakers do not have the luxury of time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What should Beijing do to cope with Donald Trump's tax cut? Chinese experts give their views[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2123365/what-should-beijing-do-cope-donald-trumps-tax-cut-chinese-experts]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some large mainland firms have already moved to the US, partly to escape high Chinese taxes. Among these, </span><span class="s3">Fuyao Glass Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> has opened the world's biggest assembly plant for automotive glass in Ohio, far from its old headquarters in Fuqing, Fujian province; and beverages bottler </span><span class="s3">Hangzhou Wahaha Group</span><span class="s1"> has been working on a possible takeover of the biggest US milk processor, </span><span class="s3">Dean Foods</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan's </span><span class="s3">Foxconn Technology</span><span class="s1">, one of the leading industrial employers on the mainland, is setting up a US$10 billion assembly plant in Wisconsin to take advantage of the state's generous tax breaks. No wonder the central government is keeping a close watch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Sino-US trade war may be upon us - and China may have the upper hand[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2123336/sino-us-trade-war-may-be-upon-us-and-china-may-have-upper]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it is not yet a cause for alarm. The Trump tax reform reduces corporate taxes from the nominal rate of 35 per cent to 20 per cent. Compared with China where a corporation may pay up to 40 per cent in taxes, a wide tax differential may seem to open up. In reality, most US corporations have been paying no more than 20 per cent in taxes, thanks to many loopholes in the tax code. Also, many Chinese companies prefer to operate in a familiar business and regulatory environment even if it means paying higher taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But one area should concern China. The Trump tax reform provides real incentives for US companies to repatriate their offshore profits and earnings. This may lessen the availability of US corporate capital to invest overseas. China still craves American technology, capital and innovation. It may have to create a more attractive business environment for investment, both foreign and domestic.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below US$3 trillion in January for the first time in six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The breach of the psychologically important level raises the question of whether they are still sufficiently large to guarantee Beijing's ability to continue supporting the yuan. The consensus among observers seems to be yes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the rapid fall in reserves serves as a warning sign that individuals and companies are still managing to get around regulations designed to prevent capital flight, analysts caution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of China's foreign exchange (forex) reserves slipped to US$2.998 trillion at the end of January, down US$12 billion from a month earlier, official data indicated. It was the seventh consecutive monthly drop and the first time the reserves have breached the US$3 trillion mark since February 2011.Our view is that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> can afford to keep selling FX at the current pace for a long timeJulian Evans-Pritchard, </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Excluding currency valuation effects, forex reserves may have fallen by US$37 billion in January, after declining US$35 billion in December, according to a </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">' estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves are “a telling indicator of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s [</span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">] eagerness to stem the yuan decline,” said Jingyi Pan, a strategist for </span><span class="s3">IG Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The breach of the psychological level raises concerns, though the authorities had done their part downplaying these concerns by stating that fluctuations in foreign exchange reserves is normal,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Much of the concern is focused on whether the central bank is still able to maintain its control of the stability of the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our view is that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> can afford to keep selling FX at the current pace for a long time,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist for London-based research firm </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">) guidelines suggest that, given the scale of China's export income, money supply, foreign liabilities and capital controls, its forex reserves could fall to as low as US$1.8 trillion and still offer adequate protection against balance of payment strains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, although the breach of US$3 trillion itself may not be hugely significant, the rapid decline in reserves is a red flag indicating that policies aimed at preventing money from escaping the mainland are flawed, according to some analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If there is anything that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> policy makers can take away from this reserve erosion, it is the fact the current financial market model they rely on is stale and in need of an overhaul,” said Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda Asia Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Despite their [the authority's] heavy-handed interventions, the reserve data clearly signals greater than anticipated capital flight and highlights the ineffectiveness of current policies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tim Condon, an analyst for ING Asia, said the current level of reserves, according to the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> standard, still remains adequate. But he expects the situation to become more urgent if Chinese residents continue transferring their money overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Capital controls could be tightened but that wouldn't dampen the sentiment,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He believes the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> may guide the yuan higher to fight the trend and ensure stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The most direct path would be for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to appreciate the CNY fixing,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China may tighten capital controls as yuan outflow continues[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2057673/china-may-tighten-capital-controls-yuan-outflow-continues]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> analysts also forecast that the erosion of reserves will prompt a more heavy-handed approach by the Chinese authorities to support the yuan and restrict residents from pulling money out of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If anything, the fall in China FX reserves to USD 2.998tn is not only confirmation that renminbi depreciation and capital outflow pressures remained evident as of end-January, but also that persistent reserves depletion should make the authorities rely on more capital controls and higher onshore rates to achieve stability,” said Kelvin Lau, Eddie Cheung, and Chidu Narayanan in a recent research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More liquidity tightening measures may be on the horizon, with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> likely to raise domestic interest rates further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe maintaining the interest rate differential with the US was one of the considerations behind the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s recent 10 bps [basis points] hikes across its reverse repo [repurchase agreements], medium-term lending facility and standing lending facility rates,” Lau and Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This, together with rising inflation and the need for deleveraging, means there could be another 20bps of such hikes in the pipeline before year-end.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said if capital controls are strictly enforced, China's outflows are likely to moderate to around US$400 billion in 2017 from above US$ 700 billion last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest regulatory challenge facing Chinese companies wanting to snap up European assets next year isn't political opposition from governments, it's getting the money out of the country in the first place, according to a leading London-based M&amp;A specialist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Richard Butterwick, a London-based partner with US-headquartered law firm </span><span class="s3">Latham &amp; Watkins</span><span class="s1">, was in Hong Kong then Beijing to take part in two conferences about China-outbound M&amp;A in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the major regulatory challenge for Chinese companies hoping to spend overseas were domestic Chinese policies that made it difficult to actually get their funds out the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's not about restrictions in Europe - it's about the ability of Chinese company to put themselves in a position domestically to get cleared to do a transaction and to have the clearance for their money to be used offshore. That is the real hurdle," he told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That process has been streamlined in recent years, and it's no coincidence that has coincided with an increase in outbound M&amp;A."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments were made last week, before sources told the Post of a central government policy shift designed to curb mainland China's outbound investment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent months there has been a series of instances of governments blocking Chinese investment in Europe, especially in Germany, where economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in October reopened a review of the Chinese takeover of the semiconductor company </span><span class="s3">Aixtron</span><span class="s1"> after a growing backlash to Chinese investment. It follows calls by Gabriel for </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> measures to give national governments more powers to block or impose conditions on shareholdings of non-EU companies.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next year, economists are expecting a backlash from European elections, Donald Trump coming to power in the US, and Brexit being triggered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Butterwick still expects M&amp;A into Europe from China to continue at significant levels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market has challenges, it always does, but it's a reasonably robust market," Butterwick said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We see strong interest from Chinese bidders in Europe and I would say that would continue at the same levels rather than see material changes."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The depreciation of sterling and the euro is helpful to maintain the already high levels of China M&amp;A in the major European economies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around 45 per cent of Chinese outbound M&amp;A activity, or US$94,839 million, as headed for Europe this year to date, more than any other region, according to Dealogic figures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Latham &amp; Watkins</span><span class="s1"> has more than 200 M&amp;A lawyers based in Europe. Butterwick's fellow partner Martin Saywell, also visiting Hong Kong from London, is equally optimistic about M&amp;A into the UK continuing after Brexit was triggered and does not see activity dropping off, despite a fall in volumes in the 11 weeks since the Brexit vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The UK needs foreign direct investment," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also played down the recent German moves against the Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are very political reasons why that decision has taken place, in the same way that the UK needs FDI for its own reasons, Germany and France and other countries in Europe need FDI and the most obvious source for that at the moment is from China."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saywell said it was more important to think about how to present a bid - and often the message that resonated most strongly, was ‘jobs and investment'.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If you see what's happened with the UK populist vote and also what's happened with the US as well, three things on people's agendas are jobs, investment and what the future means."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If it makes commercial, financial and business sense, it's well presented as being a proposition which increases jobs and investments, then it's very difficult to see why politics would trump rational, economic decisions like that."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Link Investment Holdings chairman and chief executive Brett McGonegal is among those who actually see Chinese outbound M&amp;A picking up next year due to the dropping value of the yuan, which some analysts think will devalue to 7.0 to the US dollar by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies aren't getting the returns they need onshore, so are looking offshore for returns through large-scale M&amp;As, he told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's counter intuitive, but the weaker currency actually is just a small part of the reason why China has embarked on a huge outbound M&amp;A spree, because they need to increase quality," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't necessarily think political risk is that big of a deal either, it's a land grab right now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The weaker Europe gets, the more desperate they are to sell assets."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities are stepping up their monitoring of yuan outflow, in addition to tightening up scrutiny of overseas investments, in an attempt to curb the sharp depreciation of the currency since October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net outbound yuan payments have totaled 1.8 trillion in the year to date, while offshore yuan deposits declined by 255.7 billion yuan, according to new data compiled by Wind Information and </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (CICC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This suggests RMB outflows may have become a way for Chinese companies to circumvent foreign exchange (FX) controls, by moving capital across borders, and converting it into foreign exchange denominated assets offshore," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Offshore RMB lending to finance Chinese companies' overseas investment has become a key channel for RMB outflows, as have dividend payments and profit repatriation," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Different levels of restriction over RMB and foreign exchange capital activities may have attracted regulatory arbitrage, and resulted in an the acceleration of RMB outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China may well incorporate RMB outflows into a unified macro-prudential regulatory framework for cross-border capital flow [in future] if the currency pressure heightens," it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some commercial banks have already been receiving guidance from the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, the central bank, on how to tighten their capital account controls, particularly when dealing with items involving overseas direct investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the past, any outflow below one billion yuan could be settled before reporting to the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE). But starting today, all outflow above 500 million yuan needs the signature of a local bank deputy governor," one banker with a Shanghai based state-owned commercial bank told the Post, asking not to be named.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign investment ‘shopping spree' over as Beijing moves to slash capital outflow[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2050029/chinas-foreign-investment-shopping-spree-over-beijing-moves-slash]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The order we received is to strictly verify the source of capital and the purpose for overseas usage, to make sure the outflow is reasonable, and in accordance with rules and law," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has fallen over 6 per cent against the US dollar this year, dropping around 2 per cent since the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the US election, leaving it at an eight and a half year low against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign currency reserves have fallen to their lowest since March 2011 to US$ 3.12 trillion by the end of October, with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> widely believed to have sold US dollars to cushion the currency's decline.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a bid to prevent continued sharp falls in the yuan, while at the same time halting the ongoing drain of the country's foreign exchange reserves, the government has enacted a string of measures, mainly blocking the outflow channels, including banning Chinese customers from buying overseas insurance products other than accident and medical-related policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported on Friday that China planed to tighten controls on companies looking to invest abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Targeted for particular scrutiny by the pending measures are "extra-large" foreign acquisitions valued at US$10 billion or more per deal, property investments by state-owned firms above US$1 billion and investments of US$1 billion or more by any Chinese company in an overseas entity unrelated to the investor's core business.The depreciation pressure on the yuan should ease as outflows taper, but that may only work temporarilyAdian Yao, senior emerging Asia economist, AXA Investment</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a statement from </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1">, four national authorities - the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC), the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, and SAFE - have made a joint that China is still promoting healthy outbound investment, but "will verify some overseas investment projects", according to rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adian Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment, said: "The tightening is meant to curb overseas investment using high leverage, or targets that are unrelated to the acquirer's core business, or those that are disguised capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The depreciation pressure on the yuan should ease as outflows taper, but that may only work temporarily," he said, adding in the short term, the movement of yuan is still largely dependent on the US dollar's momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's investment in private sector organisations remains low, at 27.7 per cent of GDP as of June, compared with 133.8 per cent of GDP for the US, and 161 per cent of GDP for Japan, according to the CICC note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rise of Chinese overseas investment is a long-term trend, but it should be a gradual process," it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It takes time for Chinese companies to learn and adapt to local cultures, ethical practises, regulatory standards... Leveraged deals that are not motivated by real investment opportunities but intrinsically one-way bets against the RMB may have to pay high "learning costs" when things turn unfavourable."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing will not use a sharply devalued yuan as a weapon to gain an upper hand in its trade war with the US, as it will do more bad than good to China's economy and hurt its image as an upholder of free trade, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past month China's yuan has swung from being one of the stronger global currencies to an underperformer, suffering a 3.3 per cent depreciation against the US dollar, reflecting its worst single-month decline since Beijing established its foreign exchange market in 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese officials have been careful to stress there is no official policy to devalue its currency as part of a salvo in the ongoing trade battle with the US, arguing instead that market forces have been the major driver in the yuan's softening.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the central bank, said in a recent statement that the yuan's drop is likely only temporary as China's economic fundamental point to a stronger currency in the longer term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no possibility of significant depreciation,” Guo said in an interview on Thursday with the state-run media group Financial News, a publication affiliated with the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">. He added that the yuan would likely tend to be stronger in the future.There is no possibility of significant depreciationGuo Shuqing, party secretary of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In recent years, some international punters have tried to earn big profits by shorting the yuan. The facts proved they had made serious misjudgment over the situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo was the latest senior official to provide reassurance from Beijing that the yuan would not depreciate drastically.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PBOC governor Yi Gang and China's foreign exchange administrator Pan Gongsheng made similar statements on repeated occasions in the past week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's Ministry of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> said on Friday that it would take its case to the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government sources told the Post that Beijing has not adopted a weak yuan policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the trade war with the US, there were suggestions that China should allow the yuan to devalue moderately to offset impacts from Trump's tariffs … but the Ministry of Commerce has long lost its decision-making power over the yuan, although it still has the influence,” a source within the Ministry of Commerce said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, which is the primary agency overseeing the yuan exchange rate, does not want to see a rapid depreciation, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, China would prefer a stable currency to help facilitate internal reform and economic transformation, in addition to stable relationships with the Eurozone, Japan and emerging economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Net exports contributed only 0.7 percentage points to the overall growth made by the Chinese economy last year. Its contribution is largely dwarfed by domestic consumption and investment,” said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's priority is on stabilising internal conditions with proper monetary and fiscal policies, he said, adding that a currency war would cause regional or even global capital flow turmoil.A significant devaluation against the US dollar is highly likely to trigger yuan depreciation against other major currencies - the beggar thy neighbour game will put everyone in a turbulent situationAidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers Asia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A significant devaluation against the US dollar is highly likely to trigger yuan depreciation against other major currencies - the beggar thy neighbour game will put everyone in a turbulent situation. It will go in conflict with China's image as a defender of globalisation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen Jianguang, an economist with Mizuho Securities Asia argued that the exchange rate was becoming less relevant in determining the flow of global exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Exports are more closely related to real external demand and tariff policies rather than limited changes in exchange rates,” he wrote in a research note on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan appreciated by over 6 per cent against the US dollar in 2017, while exports rebounded 10.8 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan continuously weakened during a two-year period starting in 2014 when global exports remained sluggish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen also said a significantly weaker currency would not only undermine China's domestic purchasing power and consumer sentiment, but also pose significant risk to China's inflated property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Moreover, large currency depreciation could cause domestic panic, trigger capital flight and negate the previous efforts of the Chinese government to stabilise the exchange rate and promote the internationalisation of yuan,” Shen said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China orchestrated a 2 per cent depreciation in the yuan on August 11, 2015, a sign that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was giving the market more say in determining the currency's daily mid price fixing, as Beijing was trying to join an elite reserve basket under the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What followed was a sharp sell of the yuan that drained China's foreign exchange reserve by US$1 trillion, as officials fought to calm the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China must have leaned their lesson when seeing investors' anxiety and significant capital outflow and capital market jitters. This is not a can of worms that Beijing wants to open again,” said Iris Pang, economist for Greater China at </span><span class="s3">ING Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not think a currency war is making any sense for any country. Sharp currency depreciations in the past few years, like the krona depreciation when Iceland went bankrupt after the global financial crisis, are all driven by the market, but not by the government,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The worst is over. We should have already seen the bottom this year at around 24,500, and the market is likely to bounce back in the near term. The tech sector should be driving the bounce back,” Kwong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US dollar is also likely to be weakened against other major currencies in the near term. This is because the oil price has gone down recently, which has cut down inflation pressure in the US and hence the US Fed may not to rush to increase the interest rate.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the stock market rally after the US midterm election, the yuan should continue to trade at stable levels at a range between 6.8 to 6.9 per US dollar. Premier Li Keqiang has indicated China would like to see a stable yuan. Traders generally believe the central bank in China would use all efforts to prevent the yuan from dropping below 7 per dollar to prevent substantial capital outflow,” Lo said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A rally in Hong Kong and mainland China stocks on Thursday morning proved to be short lived. Profit-taking orders flooded the market in the afternoon as investors remain cautious over the US-China trade war, said brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The morning's rally in Asian stocks followed the US market, which soared by the most since the 1982 midterm elections, but in the afternoon different markets moved in different directions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was once up 1.3 per cent in morning trading but narrowed down its gains to 0.3 per cent to close at 26,227.72 on Thursday. The Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises Index was up 0.6 per cent to 10,703.59.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, the markets fared worse and shed their morning gains to end lower for a fourth day in a row.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which was at one point trading up 1 per cent, ended the day 0.2 per cent lower to close at 2,635.63. The CSI300, which tracks the largest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, was down 0.3 per cent to 3,212.77. The Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.7 per cent to 7,698.02.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There were a lot of profit-taking orders in afternoon trade, as investors wanted to cash out once the markets bounced back. There is tough resistance for the market to go up any higher, as investors are still worried about the trade war,” said Robert Lee, executive director at brokerage firm Grand Finance Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US midterm elections have ended, but there is no signal yet to show the new political environment will mean any change to US policy over trade tariffs [levied] on mainland China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said the market would stay at current levels until the US announces any major changes in its trade policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> rose by almost 3 per cent to HK$301.6 in the morning but narrowed its gain down to 0.07 per cent, to close at HK$293. Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2.2 per cent before narrowing its gain down to 1.2 per cent, to close at HK$227. Chinese insurance giant Ping An increased by 0.8 per cent to HK$79.20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apple supplier </span><span class="s3">AAC Technologies</span><span class="s1"> was down by 7 per cent and closed at HK55.8 after reporting a lower than expected result.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Casino stocks fell. </span><span class="s3">Wynn Macau</span><span class="s1"> was down 9.7 per cent and closed at HK$17.06 after its management issued a bearish outlook for the fourth quarter. </span><span class="s3">Galaxy Entertainment</span><span class="s1"> was down 3.8 per cent to HK$44.25.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regional stock markets fared better, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Stock Average rising 1.8 per cent, or 401 points, to close at 22,486.92. Seoul's Kospi was up 0.7 per cent at 2,092.63, and Sydney's All Ordinaries rose 0.6 per cent to 6,015.90.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regional rally followed a rise in US stocks. The technology-heavy </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> was up 2.6 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.1 per cent, while the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> Composite Index was up 1.6 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong and other Asian markets all follow the US stock markets. The election is over, and now the focus will be back on US and China negotiations on the trade war. If a solution can be found soon, the benchmark Hang Seng Index could continue its rally to test the 27,000 or even 28,000 level,” said Ben Kwong Man-bun, director at </span><span class="s3">KGI Asia</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The worst is over. We should have already seen the bottom this year, at around 24,500, and the market is likely to bounce back in the near term. The tech sector should be driving the bounce back,” said Kwong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the currency front, traders are waiting on the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">, which is meeting on Wednesday and Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While it is widely expected the US Fed will not change the interest rate in today's meeting, all eyes are on the statement issued after the meeting, for any prediction of interest rate rise movement,” said Jasper Lo, chief investment strategist at Eddid Securities and Futures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US dollar is also likely to be weakened against other major currencies in the near term. This is because the oil price has gone down recently, which has cut down on inflation pressure in the US and, hence, the US Fed may not rush to increase the interest rate. The chance for the December Fed meeting to increase the interest rate is only at about 70 per cent,” said Lo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan, traded by mainland traders, weakened by 0.1 per cent to 6.9266 per US dollar on Thursday afternoon; the offshore yuan, traded by international investors, was down by 0.09 per cent to 6.9240.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With the stock market rally after the US midterm elections, the yuan should continue to trade at stable levels, at a range between 6.8-6.9 yuan per US dollar. Premier Li Keqiang has indicated China would like to see a stable yuan,” said Lo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Traders generally believe the central bank in China will use all efforts to prevent the yuan from dropping below 7 per dollar to prevent substantial capital outflow.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We prefer buying land suitable for the development of high-end residential and commercial projects,” said Tommy Ting, vice president of </span><span class="s3">Goldin Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market has been confused by the outcome of some recent land sales. We have seen some government sites sold for shockingly high prices but these just reflected the successful bidder's special interest in that individual site.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It cannot serve as the market benchmark. Over all, land prices are not really that high.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, the group said in a stock exchange filing that it would take a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture, with the remaining 40 per cent held by Pan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan was ranked the ninth richest person in Hong Kong in May, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of US$5.6 billion.We have seen some government sites sold for shockingly high prices...it cannot serve as the market benchmarkTommy Ting, vice president, </span><span class="s3">Goldin Financial</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He does not expect land prices in prime locations to fall from their current levels, as both Hong Kong and mainland players remain keen to acquire sites for development in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting said developers' appetite for land in Hong Kong would not be deterred by the 25 basis points rise in US interest rates or the tighter mainland government curbs on capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's recent restrictions would not mean a halt of all capital outflows or outbound investment, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting does not see home prices moving by more than 5 per cent in either direction next year, as first-time buyers will be unaffected by the recent increase in stamp duty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government raised stamp duty for all residential transactions to 15 per cent to curb price growth on November 5. Non-property owners are exempted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting was speaking as the firm released its first grade-A office project, Goldin Financial Global Centre, in Kowloon Bay, for leasing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sam Li , general manager for leasing, </span><span class="s3">Goldin Financial</span><span class="s1">, said the asking rents for the 23-storey building would be HK$27 to HK$40 per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Negotiations with banks, financial institutions and foreign corporations to take up office spaces were under way, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total investment of the development was HK$6 billion, inclusive of the HK$3.43 billion </span><span class="s3">Goldin Financial</span><span class="s1"> paid for the site in a government land tender in July 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Located at 17 Kai Cheung Road, the project has a total gross floor area of 900,000 square feet for lease - 800,000 sq ft of office space and 100,000 sq ft earmarked for restaurants.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese conglomerate HNA Holding Group has outbid 20 rivals to win its second residential site in Kai Tak for a record HK$13,600 per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HNA secured the parcel of land, known as Kai Tak Area 1L Site 3, with a bid of HK$5.41 billion, 24 per cent to 38 per cent higher than the market expectation of HK$2.98 billion to HK$4.38 billion, or HK$7,500 to HK$11,000 per square feet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HK$13,600 per square foot price tag is HK$100 higher than the previous record set by HNA on November 2 when it bought an adjacent plot - Kai Tak Area 1K Site 3 - for HK$8.84 billion.The big premium reflects the developer's confidence that the area will be transformed into Hong Kong's second core business districtThomas Lam, senior director, Knight Frank</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The unexpectedly high bid came despite a weaker outlook for developers in the wake of the interest rate rise in the US and the introduction by mainland authorities of tighter curbs on capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Lam, senior director at Knight Frank, expects the total investment cost for the latest site will be more than HK$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The big premium reflects the developer's confidence that the area will be transformed into Hong Kong's second core business district in the future,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vincent Cheung Kiu-cho, executive director of valuation and advisory services for Asia at </span><span class="s3">Colliers International</span><span class="s1">, said the bid submitted by HNA raised concerns that the group intends to support the land price at Kai Tak after securing the first plot for such a jaw-dropping sum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If this adjacent site had sold for a lower price, it may have complicated the group's plan to raise financing from banks after seeing land prices drop in such a short period of time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest acquisition has increased the value of HNA's property investments in Hong Kong to HK$14.25 billion against the listed firm's market capitalisation of just HK$3.13 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On December 4, HNA Holding announced that its controlling shareholder, Hong Kong HNA Holding Group, had pledged 6.39 billion shares in the listed vehicle “as security for certain banking facilities or guarantees”, according to a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange that did not disclose the size of the loan it intended to raise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung said the group could achieve better economy of scale by merging the two adjacent Kai Tak sites into one bigger residential development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Combining the two sites would yield a residential development with a gross floor area of 1.05 million square feet, making the land cost HK$13,537 per sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung expects HNA to offer the units built on the site for around HK$22,000 per square foot in order to generate a reasonable profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, apartments at the One Kai Tak development, built by </span><span class="s3">China Overseas Land &amp; Investment</span><span class="s1">, were selling for HK$18,500 to HK$20,000 per sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked' at record sale result for Kai Tak area site[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2042394/hong-kong-property-experts-shocked-record-sale-result-kai-tak-area-site]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The key objective of the Kai Tak development area - the site of Hong Kong's former airport - is to house a population of up to 90,000 and create more than 83,000 jobs by making it the core part of the city's second central business district. It aims to provide 62.43 million square feet of office space, double that of Central by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam believes upcoming land auctions in the area will continue to generate ample interest from other developers, although he does not foresee any further record-breaking bids.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Taking into account the potential for further rate rises in Hong Kong and the new stamp duty, land prices in the area are unlikely to set new record highs again,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2013, the government has sold eight residential sites and one commercial plot in Kai Tak. The cost of residential land in the area has jumped 201 per cent from HK$4,913 per sq ft in June, 2013, to HK$13,600 per sq ft on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest site, which will yield a total gross floor area of 397,967 sq ft, is close to the proposed Kai Tak MTR station and would enjoy one of the best view in the area, according to James Cheung, a director at Centaline Surveyors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has described the country's measures for limiting the yuan's outflows as a temporary means for preventing capital flight and restoring calm to the currency markets, said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's chief executive Norman Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Governor Zhou said the measures are for the short term,” Chan said in Beijing, after leading a visit by the Hong Kong Association of Bankers to the Chinese central bank. “When the market condition becomes stable, the capital flow will be back to normal.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> imposed a limit on companies that wanted to remit the yuan, equivalent to 30 per cent of their shareholders' equity two weekend ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to the cap, non-financial firms are only allowed to execute any transfers as loans to offshore entities, and these must be supported by valid commercial reasons and must be repaid as per schedule, according to the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the new rule took effect, mainland banks had been discouraging customers from any cross-border transactions in their capital accounts, including for overseas debt repayments, despite having set up intra-group yuan cash pools on both sides of the border with China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move follows the yuan's deterioration against the US dollar by as much as 7 per cent this year, as the greenback surged against global currencies on expectations that interest rates would rise back home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result of the yuan's weakening, many Chinese companies and ordinary citizens had been devising schemes to take their currency out of the country before it deteriorates further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those measures may be subjected to adjustments once the currency markets are stabilised, Chan said Monday, after his meeting with Zhou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's three-day trip to Beijing included visits to the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank</span><span class="s1">, as well as with Chinese vice premier Ma Kai, who formerly headed the National Development &amp; Reform Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By using administrative measures to control the currency, the Chinese monetary authority is exercising greater flexibility “to highlight that the overall direction of China's financial reforms remain market-oriented, and remain unchanged,” said ANZ Bank's China economist Qu Tianshi. These are just measures “put in place to stem the capital outflows,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“To a great extent the controls will depend on market conditions, until the depreciation pressure eases on the yuan and the capital outflow subsides,” Qu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan strengthened on Monday for the first day in four, rising to 6.9472 per dollar, after tumbling last week when the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised interest rates and officially ended almost a decade of easy finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the shrink in renminbi liquidity pool is as a result of investors' adjustment in asset allocation amid the depreciation, but it will have little impact on Hong Kong's banking sector and the internationalisation of the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An imbalance in demand for offshore renminbi is normal,” Chan said. “Although it will cause volatility in the exchange rate, this is also with the market's expectation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">May Tan, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, said the shrinking renminbi liquidity pool will have little impact on the banking sector as banks are still conducting businesses in other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan, who is also chief executive at Standard Chartered for Hong Kong, said China is still committed to the internationalisation of renminbi despite those temporary measures to stem outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan short sellers working on the assumption that monetary policy easing is around the corner may need a change of plan as Beijing could once again prove those bearish bets are misplaced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When money mangers started to leave yuan-denominated assets because of possible depreciation risks, they might have underestimated Beijing's determination to globalise its currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To achieve its grand plan, Beijing is keen to keep its currency stable even if that means the yuan will continue to strengthen against almost all the other currencies as they weaken against a strong dollar, and hence dent Chinese export competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The strong focus on internationalising the CNY, opening up China's capital account, coupled with the pledge from Premier Li, have helped to stabilise and rebuild confidence in the CNY,” said </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analyst Koon How Heng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This ring-fences the CNY from the ongoing efforts by the PBoC (</span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">) to ease monetary policy and stabilise China's growth outlook,” said Koon, who upgraded the outlook on the yuan against the dollar from “negative” to “neutral”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has been hovering just above 6.20 since mid-April when Premier Li Keqiang told the </span><span class="s3">Financial Times</span><span class="s1"> that the nation's monetary policy has not been designed to weaken the currency in order to boost exports. The PBoC has also kept the official midpoint rate of the currency exchange band relatively stable around 6.11 to 6.12 in recent weeks.We no longer see risk of gradual weakness in the CNY and expect range trading around 6.20 against the USD, going forwardKoon How Heng,analyst, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strong state backing for the currency is believed to be a matter of commitment even if it comes at the cost of exports. There are plenty of reasons why Beijing would want a stable currency as one of its policy priorities, at least for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stable currency will boost the incentive for foreign trading and investment entities to choose yuan in their transactions, a key indicator in the technical assessment by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> in its review of the Special Drawing Right basket - an elite club of currencies Beijing wants the yuan to join this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, the nation is launching the first phase of a globally centralised payment system by year-end, the so-called China International Payment System (CIPS), which will need a stable currency to encourage offshore trading partners to boost trading volumes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, capital outflow is something Beijing does not want to see.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The fear of large destabilising capital flows out of China has not materialised,” said Koon. According to </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, the foreign exchange flows by mainland commercial banks suggest that capital outflows from the country have eased in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> expects yuan to trade around 6.20 in the coming months, up from the previous forecast of 6.29 in three months and 6.33 in 12 months, which represent 1.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent depreciation from its current level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In other words, we no longer see risk of gradual weakness in the CNY and expect range trading around 6.20 against the USD, going forward,” said Koon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of China's leading property developers have raised their sales targets after posting significant sales growth in the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say the strong performance has been driven by the central government's prolonged credit easing measures, but they caution that policy could be tightened in the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai-based CIFI Group, on Wednesday said it has revised its full year contracted sales target by 20 per cent to 43.8 billion yuan, from 36.5 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's sales surged 162 per cent year on year in the first six months to 27.6 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Helped by a sturdy recovery in Shanghai and Suzhou city, the developer saw its average selling price jump 107 per cent to 27,300 yuan per square metre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Country Garden, one of the biggest Chinese developers, also raised its annual target to 220 billion yuan, a 31 per cent rise.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Guangdong developer was one of five that saw their sales surpass 100 billion yuan in the first half, the other four were </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Evergrande Real Estate</span><span class="s1">, Greenland, and </span><span class="s3">Poly Real Estate</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vanke, the property giant which has been trying to fend off a hostile takeover since last year, continued to lead the gainers. It recorded sales of 190 billion yuan from January to June, a 73 per cent year on year growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Policy has supported the sector and liquidity has been ample, 2016 is a pretty good year for developers," said Alan Jin, a property analyst at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin expects sales growth would be moderate in the coming six months given the government policy is unlikely to be as supportive as in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has issued a series of stimulus measures earlier this year to boost home-buying demand. These include a reduction in interest rates and home transaction taxes and a lowering of the minimum down payment requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It all depends on the policy changes, and the liquidity tends to be tightened," he said, citing currency volatility and the capital outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin added that some second-tier cities may introduce new measures to cool down the overheated market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> forecasts that sales would slow down from the high base in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The current policy support could have released most demand pent-up from 2014 and probably have also brought demand forward," Ryan Li, a property analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a note this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global rating agency S&amp;P says growth in nationwide home sales has likely peaked and will moderate to a single-digit percentage for the 12 months ending May 2017, down from 32.2 per cent for the 12 months ended May 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s Li said net gearing is likely to come down for most developers because of a more cautious approach to land acquisitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"On average major listed developers' land purchases are 36 per cent of their contracted sales [this year]," he wrote.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing will create a ministerial-level division dedicated to financial industry security within the new National Security Commission to be chaired by President Xi Jinping.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move comes as the world's number two economy is increasingly worried about speculative capital flows that may threaten domestic stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xi's vision of the NSC was expected to focus on "all kinds of emerging and new threats that the government hasn't spent too much time and resources on yet", a source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial industry security would fall into the "emerging threat" category.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do have several different departments to tackle financial security matters. For example, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has been monitoring 'hot money' closely, and the Ministry of State Security has a team of experts to deal with related problems," said a government source familiar with the situation. "But if we compare our efforts with some big Western countries, our leaders believe we still have a lot more to do with financial security, which is proving to be a serious threat not just to China but also to other countries amid the growing trend for economic globalisation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shi Yinhong , an international relations professor at Renmin University, said representatives from the financial sector would be included in the NSC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Everything related to security of the nation will be the job of the committee, and this includes the financial aspect," Shi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premier Li Keqiang , who is mainly responsible for economic and financial affairs, is commission vice-president.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A minister-level position of "financial security commissioner" has also been created and will be filled by an official with experience in the financial industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The source cited two examples of how financial security could affect domestic social stability. One involved unusual price moves on the stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some government agencies had been collecting evidence and data in recent years to prove how speculative foreign capital - "hot money" - moved through the underground banking system, rocking the stock market and affecting local investors' confidence in the mainland's economic development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another case involved the virtual currency bitcoin, in which the mainland's central bank has already banned domestic financial institutions from trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is also worried the tapering off of the US Federal Reserve's bond-buying programme may add pressure to monitor and control the pace of capital outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China overtook the US for outbound mergers and acquisition (M&amp;A) volume for the first time, with US$219.3 billion of deals announced in 2016, according to data compiled by Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The record-high deal volume came as overseas takeover activity climbed for a seventh consecutive year, according to a full review of 2016 released by Dealogic on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It put China slightly ahead of the US on US$217.69 billion, down from $237.99 billion in 2015, although Dealogic said the figures are based on preliminary annual data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A total of 745 cross-border deals by China were announced in 2016, accounting for more than half of Asia Pacific's outbound volume, which hit a record US$445.1 billion, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some analysts believe it might mark a near-term plateau, as the Chinese authorities strengthen their scrutiny of outbound M&amp;A activity and tighten checks on capital outflows in a bid to curb yuan depreciation and a draining of foreign reserves pool.Outbound mergers and acquisition activity will slow sharply over the first quarter of 2017Shaun Rein, China Market Research Group</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, said: "Outbound M&amp;A activity will slow sharply over the first quarter of 2017, as the Chinese government is making it very difficult to get approval to convert currency, even for legitimate business transactions, because they are very concerned about capital outflow pressure."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an attempt to counter the yuan's steep devaluation, the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> has introduced stricter rules on overseas payments and lending, and guided commercial banks to scrutinise reasons for large overseas payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chairman at Capital Link International, said: "There is certainly a strong headwind pushing back on overseas M&amp;A of late, driven directly by the new policy and indirectly from evolving soft capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Capital flight under the guise of M&amp;A at any expense will not be tolerated and will be heavily scrutinised. The inexperienced corporates and investors are sidelined for now until the new rules are finalised and clearly articulated."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He does not expect to a new record set in 2017 but believes larger, more strategic deals may be executed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The trend over the next five years will continue higher after a plateau in 2017. I would think 2018 will set new records as we enter a new global cycle led by China growing at 7 per cent and the US growing at 4 per cent," said McGonegal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ChemChina announced the largest outbound M&amp;A deal in Chinese history in February. The US$46.7 billion acquisition of </span><span class="s3">Syngenta</span><span class="s1">, a Swiss seed and pesticide maker, is still pending approval from the authorities in the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other eye-catching deals this year include Chinese home appliance maker Midea's US$5 billion acquisition of Kuka, the German robot maker, and insurance giant Anbang's US$14 billion approach for </span><span class="s3">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide</span><span class="s1">, although this second deal fell apart when Anbang aborted its bid.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Dealogic report showed that, globally, M&amp;A activity was down this year after three consecutive years of gains. Total volume of US$3.69 trillion represented a drop from the 2015 record high of US$4.66 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While global volume fell 21 per cent year-on-year, M&amp;A revenue was down only 6 per cent by mid-December, the Dealogic report said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-border M&amp;A was down 10 per cent globally year‐on‐year, despite China achieving record outbound volume and the US hitting a record US$476.1 billion of inbound volume, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">AT&amp;T</span><span class="s1">'s US$85.4 billion cash-and-stock takeover of </span><span class="s3">Time Warner</span><span class="s1"> in October was the year's largest M&amp;A deal, as the telecommunications giant looked to bolster its content offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For only the second time on record, technology led global M&amp;A with US$605.8 billion, closing on last year's record high of $691.6bn. The energy and real estate sectors followed, with US$378 billion and US$363.1 billion in deal volume, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first time since 2012, health care M&amp;A fell outside the top three, ranking fourth for volume with US$296.3 billion, the lowest level since 2012 when it was US$170.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private M&amp;A activity increased 25 per cent to 132 transactions in 2016, from 106 deals in 2015, its most active year since 2007 when there were 182 deals. Volume was down 11 per cent year‐on‐year, however, to US$91.7 billion in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Withdrawn M&amp;A volume of US$839.4 billion in 2016 was the highest since 2008 when it was US$948.5 billion, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> is perfectly sensible in making preparatory moves well ahead of any likely rise in US interest rates in the middle of this month, analysts agree, by strengthening the yuan in an effort to prevent any further rise in capital outflow, that could affect the country's economic mission of deleveraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts still report the country is seeing sustained levels of capital leaving its shores.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past ten days, the yuan has appreciated 1.1 per cent against the US dollar in the onshore market, and 1.5 per cent in the offshore market, where the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">has also engineered a spike in short-term interbank lending rate, a rare move in such a tightly managed currency market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, onshore yuan closed at 6.8014 against the greenback, strengthened by 70 pips from 6.8084 from the opening price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It set the reference rate at 6.7935 yuan per US dollar, stronger by 135 basis points, or 0.2 per cent stronger than Friday. Traders are allowed to trade 2 per cent either side of the reference point.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On May 26 the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> announced it would tweak its mechanism for fixing the daily yuan rate by adding a “counter-cyclical adjustment factor”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders believe the range of measures being made are aimed at crushing speculators who have a bearish outlook on the yuan, by sending out a clear signal the country will not tolerate a weakening currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts with BofA Merrill Lynch said they believe concerns over the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s potential monetary policy tightening on June 14 has certainly “added pressure on the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> [to make these move]”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The key motivation here is that while controls have been successful in reducing outflows, China continues to see sustained foreign exchange buying,” the report said.While capital controls have been successful in reducing outflows, China continues to see sustained foreign exchange buyingAnalysts with BofA Merrill Lynch</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite disappointing job data posted on Monday, market participants still largely anticipate the US Fed to raise its rates at its next meeting on June 14.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is especially vulnerable to Fed tightening as any renewed acceleration of capital outflows undermines its efforts to engineer successful deleveraging,” the BofA Merrill Lynch report added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">??????Name??????, a senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, said the cycle of Fed rates had triggering repeated yuan devaluation and outflow over the past two years, and agreed the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is under growing strain to prepare for the next eventuality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Debt levels in China are still high while deleveraging efforts, without triggering systemic risk, require accommodative liquidity conditions,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Any accelerated outflow following the Fed's move may cause abrupt domestic liquidity tightening, which will leave the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> without responsive options - that partly explains why Beijing is moving early this time.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he considered the abrupt strengthening of the yuan might also be an over-reaction by the market, rather then direct willingness of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to keep it strong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Baston, director of China research for Gavekal, underlined the possibility that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was moving ahead of the Fed, by guiding yuan expectations, but also said it was unlikely, having already risen rates in China recently, that rates here would rise further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is not planning to raise rates again in mid-June, then it knows it will have to counter market expectations, and that it might have to do so after the Fed move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So it's trying to push market sentiment in its direction ahead of time, and build up some potential defences against downward pressure on the renminbi,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial institutions, meanwhile, are also revising up their outlook on yuan's.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> revised up its value against US dollar to 6.90 by end 2017 (from 7.10) and 7.0 by end-2018 (from 7.24), as a tighter domestic policy stance can partly offset depreciation pressures from upcoming Fed rate hikes, a research note published on Wednesday said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The era of cheap mortgage rates in Hong Kong is truly over as the top nine mortgage lenders this week raised mortgage rates for new borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Existing homeowners, who have an outstanding HK$1.258 trillion (US$163 billion), have not yet felt the pain but can expect to pay more too, with banks expected to increase their prime rate by the end of this month - the first rise in 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After </span><span class="s3">Citibank</span><span class="s1"> increased its mortgage rates for new borrowers by 10 basis points on Tuesday - for the first time in more than a decade - </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1">, said in separate statements late on Wednesday night they too would be raising their mortgage rates by 10 basis points from next Monday. </span><span class="s3">China Citic Bank International</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday morning announced the same move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wing Lung Bank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> (Asia), however, said their increases would be effective from Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Homeowners beware: Citibank first to raise mortgage rate in Hong Kong[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2158614/homeowners-beware-citibank-first-raise-mortgage-rate-hong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That means nine of the top 10 mortgage lenders, which have combined 84 per cent of mortgage market share, have increased their mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Home loan rates offered by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (HK) </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> are expected to rise by 10 basis points in line with </span><span class="s3">Citibank</span><span class="s1">'s increase while the rest are making similar moves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their new Hibor-linked mortgage cap has now increased to 2.35 per cent with their new prime rate-linked mortgage rate 2.25 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New mortgage borrowers from those banks will have to pay about an additional HK$50 per month (US$6.37) for every HK$1 million of lending over a 30-year term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For a typical HK$4 million, 30-year mortgage loan, the monthly repayment for a prime-linked mortgage will be increased from HK$15,086 to HK$15,289 representing an increase of HK$203 per month. A Hibor-linked mortgage under the new cap would see its monthly repayment increased from HK$15,289 to HK$15,494, representing HK$205 per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the banks increasetheir mortgage loans this week for new borrowers, the next step is to increase the prime lending rate which would apply to all existing mortgage loans and other types of lending,” said Jasper Lo, chief investment strategies at Eddid Securities and Futures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This may happen as soon as the end of this month or early September, well before the initial expectation of a </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> rate rise at the end of September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The poor stock markets recently have led to some capital outflow which has dried up liquidity in the interbank market. Funding [in the interbank market] has become more expensive and they [banks] have had to increase the deposit rate to compete for funding. This has added cost, hence the increases in the mortgage rate and later the prime rate,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rate rise is minimal and only applies on new mortgage loans. As such, it will not have a big impact on the property market as a whole,” said Ivy Wong, managing director of Centaline Mortgage Broker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But existing mortgage borrowers in Hong Kong, who have a total HK$1.258 trillion total outstanding in mortgage loans, according to the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, may soon also need to pay more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once banks increase their best lending rate, or the so-called prime rate, all existing mortgage loans interest rates will also be raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even Hibor-linked mortgage loans are capped by the prime rate. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> and Bank of China Hong Kong have kept their prime rate at 5 per cent, while the rest sit at 5.25 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is a record low level for Hong Kong and has stayed unchanged for over 10 years, providing cheap funding that has helped propel the local property market into the most expensive worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Centraline's Ivy Wong said even with interest rates starting to edge higher, it will not mark any turnaround in property prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The interest rate rise was expected but it is coming faster than expected,” she said, with many bankers having suggested rates would likely start going up from next month.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Even with an anticipated two rate rises in Hong Kong for a combined 0.5 per cent, it is not high enough to discourage homebuyers,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eleanor Wan, chief executive of BEA Union Investment Management, added: “US interest rates have increased twice this year. The market is expecting another two rate rises before the end of this year end, and there may be another two next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The spread between Libor and Hibor has become much narrower. The mortgage rate had not changed so far and therefore the recent rise will narrow the gap.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock index provider </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> would not be including Chinese A shares in its Emerging Markets Index, it said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Officially, the company said there will be no inclusions until China makes “significant positive improvements” to its market accessibility ahead of the next index review in June 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the third time since 2014 that the decision has gone against the A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And, as the dust settles again, analysts are now pinpointing three overarching reasons for the failure this time around, all of which are largely centred on the restrictions still in place for launching Chinese financial products overseas, and liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First, limits on the launch of A-share-linked financial products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> actually listed five major obstacles that still needed addressing since last June: “the quota allocation process”, “capital mobility restrictions”, “beneficial ownership”, “widespread voluntary suspension”, and “pre-approval requirements imposed by stock exchanges”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of those, </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> said it considers the last as remaining totally unaddressed, given that if foreign institutions want to launch any investment products overseas linked to A shares, such as ETFs and derivatives, they still need pre-approval from the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The restriction is “problematic”, said Chin Ping Chia, managing director and head of research for Asia Pacific at </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1">, during a conference call on Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If [it is] not addressed, </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> will not be conditioned to put A shares in the emerging market index,” he said.There will be no inclusions until China makes ‘significant positive improvements' to its market accessibilityMSCI statement, on including A shares in its Emerging Markets Index</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Second, voluntary trading suspensions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This refers to the wave of trading halts that took place during the stock market turmoil a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At that time, more than half of all listed Chinese companies, or some 1,400 firms, suspended their shares, putting huge strain on market liquidity and actually worsening the volatility, many agree.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On May 27, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges published separate detailed guidelines on curbing voluntary stock suspensions, stating that companies must provide proper reasons and submit necessary documents to support their claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, investors are still demanding “greater clarity” of the rules, and say they need more time to “assess the effectiveness” of the policy changes, </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> said in its statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We recognise it's a new policy. We need time to observe [the impact],” Chin said. “What global investors want to see under the new rules is that fewer companies are to be suspended. Otherwise they will have problems getting in and out of the [Chinese] markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/06/15/6a034156-32db-11e6-b997-a8e2995ff455_image_hires.jpg]Third, capital outflow concerns.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to China's current rules, the qualified foreign institutional investor programme (QFII) allows investors to buy RMB-denominated A shares in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. However, monthly repatriation of funds by global institutional investors cannot exceed 20 per cent of their investment at the end of the preceding year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope to see that [the Chinese authorities] remove the 20 per cent monthly repatriation limit, which affects the liquidity [of foreign funds],” Chin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That limit remains a major road block for international investors, in particular mutual funds that could face redemptions,” said Ronald Wan, chief executive for Hong Kong-based Partners Capital International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> claimed on Tuesday that most investors still view the 20 per cent limit as “problematic”, and the issue must be “satisfactorily addressed”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early February, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), China's foreign exchange regulator, announced that fund managers no longer needed to apply for investment quotas in the QFII system, but instead can operate a new scheme linked to the size of assets under management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ceiling of the new quota has also been increased to US$5 billion, compared with US$1 billion previously. The regulator now permits QFII funds to pull money out of China after three months, instead of the previous one year. And the repatriation frequency for QFII has also been shortened to daily.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/06/15/50efed80-32e1-11e6-b997-a8e2995ff455_image_hires.JPG]In its statement, MSCI said investors still needed “more time” to assess the effectiveness of recent policy changes regarding the “quota allocation process” and “capital mobility restrictions”.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In general, the index compiler said only “beneficial ownership” has been resolved “satisfactorily” among those five highlighted concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government clarified its stance in May on the beneficial ownership of securities through nominee holders, addressing some investor concerns by recognising the rights and interests of beneficial owners of securities, including the clients or investors of the qualified foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite SAFE's February announcement on those changes, Dai Kang from </span><span class="s3">Huatai Securities</span><span class="s1"> said: “</span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> and its clients are still very cautious about investing in Chinese markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The liquidity issue and restrictions on investment strategy have left them incapable of resisting redemption pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is the major reason why China failed.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should make good use of its competitive edge on bringing in capital and on management know-how to offer a one-stop shop service in the mainland's go-global strategy, according to Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The call comes as the volume of the nation's outbound direct investment (ODI) into the city grew by more than 18 per cent in the first 10 months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, November 18</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That was our top front page story yesterday but there is a good deal more here than first meets the eye in this gloss of the facts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chart hints at the real story. In the three months to June this year, the latest period for which figures are available, there was a net direct investment inflow to Hong Kong HK$560 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/11/18/1e8156f2-8de3-11e5-8afa-edea3e14aa04_image_hires.jpg?itok=iHcF2hZ2]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Let me put it into perspective. This was the equivalent of 99 per cent of gross domestic product over those three months. Our net direct investment inflows, net of any outflows and excluding all portfolio, derivative and other investments, was only a sliver less than the total value of all the goods and services we produced in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Which boggles the mind if it really happened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Which, of course, it did not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What happened, and has long been happening, is that big mainland investors launder their money by passing it through Hong Kong on its way in and out of the mainland so that they can pretend it is foreign investment. We connive at this because we are all in favour of money laundering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is to say, we are in favour of it if done in large amounts. If done in small amounts, we send the people who do it to jail for up to 10 years, thus proving that we are also tough on money laundering. This is called justice. You figure it out. I can't.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Normally the big flows balance each other. What comes in goes back out and our statisticians keep up the pretence that Hong Kong entities are responsible for it all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On this occasion, however, not only did the inflows run at their usual hundreds of billions of dollars a quarter, but the outflows backed up and also turned to inflows. You might say something got stuck in the U-bend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The analogy holds. Previous investments in the mainland made through Hong Kong were sold off and the money came back.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is nothing truly surprising here. The mainland's own balance of payments figures show a net capital outflow running by my calculations at some US$600 billion a year at present. The money wants out of the mainland so badly that it has backed up coming back through Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will not stay here, of course and where it will go I do not know. I do know, however, where it will not go. This is private flight capital. It will not go to Beijing's “One Belt, One Road” ambitions. It wants a return in kind and its kind is not political fluff.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, in yesterday's newspaper, under the heading “Chinese investment in Africa down 40pc in first half”, we had separate confirmation that the “One Road” element is already faltering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several lame explanations were offered for this trend but the real reason is that things have changed. Beijing is furiously pulling money back in from its foreign reserves at the moment to compensate for outwards private capital flight. It is still happy to give Africa plenty of talk but money is another thing just now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And as to Hong Kong making “good use of its competitive edge ... to offer a one-stop shop service in the mainland's go-global strategy,” well, personally I favour Cinderella as a good story.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's tighter controls on the flow of cash overseas to defend the yuan's exchange rate has had the unintended side effects of inflating domestic housing prices in major cities and crippling outbound investment, according to market watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's currency has lost about 10 per cent against the dollar since August last year when the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> surprised markets by devaluing the yuan . To avoid an exodus of funds from the country, the Chinese authorities have quietly tightened foreign exchange controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A tighter capital control that shuts the door for outflows … has helped shore up the housing boom," said Raymond Yeung, chief economist, greater China at ANZ. "I am not surprised to see capital restricted within China turn to property in major cities like Shanghai as a safe haven."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there have been no groundbreaking announcements of additional controls, China's foreign exchange authorities are getting stricter in approving deals involving capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg reported last month that </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1">, which is selling a US$3.9 billion stake in a Chinese lender and seeking permission to move the proceeds offshore, is finding difficulties in remitting funds in a quick and smooth way. </span><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> immediately denied the report.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Every Chinese citizen is granted an annual quota of US$50,000 to buy foreign exchange and it is now common practice for banks to require an appointment for over-the-counter purchases to buy large sums.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Claire Ma, a Shanghai office worker, tried to change US$5,000 US dollars at a state bank, but was told by an employee that she needed to make an appointment at least one day beforehand because the branch's daily foreign exchange cash reserves often sold out quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The more Beijing tries to impose controls on capital outflows, the more Chinese individual and corporate investors attempt to move funds abroad, especially after the yuan exchange rate broke a key psychological level of 6.7 versus the US dollar earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's official foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, shrank over three consecutive months to September, dropping to their lowest level since June 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government's efforts to end the bleeding is affecting overseas mergers and acquisitions, according to analysts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mergermarket said in a report earlier this month that the outbound M&amp;A splurge in the fourth quarter could slow down due to forex controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities have introduced stricter controls amid concerns about capital outflows through deals in which firms leverage on the acquisition of foreign shell companies to move assets out of the country to bet on the yuan's depreciation.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These general restrictions have resulted in Chinese firms losing out during the latter stages of auctions in M&amp;A deals as they await regulatory approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have already forced a consortium of Chinese bidders, including </span><span class="s3">Sinochem</span><span class="s1">, to drop out of the bidding process for German specialty chemicals maker Atotech, which is valued at US$4.4 billion, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If corporates are not fully prepared on the forex issue in advance, without informing forex regulators at the earlier stage of deals, it could lead to a disastrous aftermath such as falling behind deal closing dates," Eric Liu, a senior consultant at the law firm Linklaters, told a forum in Shanghai earlier this month.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Concerns about possible capital controls could be a factor dragging down foreign investment in China's asset market.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Foreign investors could have trimmed deals on concerns of foreign exchange losses," said Johnny Shao, the firm's head of capital markets for Shanghai and East China .

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Monetary chiefs in Hong Kong have declined to deny or confirm information obtained by the South China Morning Post that ATMs have seen a "staggering'' rise in withdrawals since the casino hub introduced the recognition technology in May[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2093408/macau-launch-facial-recognition-and-identity-card-checks-atms] as part of a bid to stem illegal capital flight from mainland China.The rise in ATM withdrawals in terms of volume and number has been staggering.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rise in ATM withdrawals in terms of volume and number has been staggering. The taps are gushing," said a source with knowledge of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It seems quite clear that as the introduction of ATM facial recognition technology in Macau has put the squeeze on cash dispensing withdrawals in Macau, the pattern of withdrawals has followed the path of least resistance - and that is to Hong Kong," the source added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The development follows a move by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to instruct local banks to submit data on cash withdrawals by UnionPay cards throughout the city's ATM network as the regulator cracks down on unauthorised capital outflow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/21/14d93b56-7d10-11e7-83c9-6be3df13972a_image_hires_085400.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Media reports - not denied by the authority - said the instruction meant commercial banks were required to submit data and documentation regarding the volume and timing of withdrawals by UnionPay cards for the first six months of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked about the surge in withdrawals, a spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority said: "We are not in a position to comment on any dialogues of a supervisory nature. As such, we are unable to confirm or deny your story, and we are afraid you will have to rely on the trustworthiness of your own contacts to verify what you have heard."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Hong Kong Association of Banks said: "We regret to advise that we do not maintain the specific details that you are inquiring about."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Monetary Authority spokeswoman added: "The HKMA endeavours to enhance the security level of banking systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have been studying the applications of different technologies[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2096086/hong-kong-monetary-chief-says-authorities-looking-using], including the feasibility, soundness and cost efficiency of facial recognition and other types of biometric authentication technologies, having regard to the technologies used in other jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we have no plans to require ATMs to install facial recognition technology."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland authorities have been strengthening regulations since last year when a decline in the value of the renminbi led to widespread capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland people are allowed to withdraw up to 100,000 yuan (HK$117,000) in renminbi overseas and remit up to US$50,000 worth of foreign currency offshore annually, according to the country's 2016 foreign exchange regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Users of UnionPay cards can withdraw up to 10,000 yuan per day for each card they hold.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To skirt around the foreign exchange controls, some individuals have been using separate ATM cards to make cash withdrawals, prompting the regulators to crack down on the practice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, regulators instructed mainland banks to report on a daily basis any offshore bank card withdrawals and bank transactions exceeding 1,000 yuan starting on August 20.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The foreign exchange authority in Shanghai has asked banks to strengthen due diligence checks of overseas direct investment by companies to stem illegal capital outflows, three banking sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local forex regulator stressed Tuesday that there is no change regarding an individual's foreign exchange quota and rules, trying to play down the issue against the backdrop of rising foreign currency transactions triggered by the Brexit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source at one state-owned bank in Shanghai said they have issued a new notice that a due diligence report on anti-money laundering is required for any company set up in the form of a limited partnership after July 2015 for overseas direct investment and seeking currency swaps of US$5 million or above. The step is taken amid strengthened anti-money laundering management of limited partners' direct overseas investment, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source at the same bank said they received instructions Tuesday morning that banks should make sure they know clearly about the source of the funds, as well as historical trade of the Chinese company, and information about the limited partners of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A third source at another domestic bank said the lender is poised to issue a similar notice on strengthened background information checks for capital outflow from companies, after attending a meeting organised by forex authorities regarding overseas investment procedures last week in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai branch of the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said yesterday that it hasn't stopped foreign exchange business for individuals, denying media reports earlier that the authority had halted the services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forex regulator also said in response to an enquiry yesterday that it has asked banks in the city to check the authenticity of overseas direct investments to guard against false claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks are required to authenticate these investments, in an effort to close channels for individuals to illegally transfer their assets overseas or for illegally emigration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under existing regulations, individual could only convert yuan to a limit of US$50,000 per year. For corporates, the foreign exchange conversion is based on its own discretion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Iris Pang, senior economist with </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong, said Tuesday that the tightened monitoring is in preparation for more capital outflows, but that the tightened monitoring does not mean tightened regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For sure, the tightened monitoring is a measure to prevent further capital outflows from China,” Pang said. “Due to Brexit, yuan depreciation will continue as the long term impact of Brexit may hurt GDP growth of UK and Europe, which may in turn hurt external trade flows between these economies and China.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland stocks fell more than 6 per cent on Tuesday, losing most of the value in the final hour of trading in an increasingly familiar pattern that has spawned theories ranging from automated trading to big investors second-guessing the government to intervene at certain levels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gerry Alfonso, a director at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai, said program trading might be one of the reasons for the markets' dramatic swings late in the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Given the high level of intraday volatility, some of the strategies used by quant funds (which use pre-set algorithms to trade) might involve looking at the market performance in the morning and early afternoon before doing significant investments," Alfonso said. "They basically look for indicators for short-term direction and then deploy significant capital to try to profit from that signal, moving the market significantly."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index sank 6.15 per cent to close at 3,748.16 points, the biggest loss since an 8.5 per cent rout on July 27. The Shenzhen Composite Index closed 6.58 per cent lower at 2,174.42 points and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">-type ChiNext Index ended 6.08 per cent weaker at 2,504.17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 2,300 stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed lower, with 1,500 losing their 10 per cent limit, while fewer than 100 stocks finished up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said there was no single trigger for the sudden drop and instead blamed market rumours and confusing government policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's just underlining how ridiculously ineffective China's market support activity is. The underlying issue of overpriced equities hasn't been addressed in the slightest," said Michael Every, the head of financial markets research at </span><span class="s3">Rabobank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Savvy investors were simply offloading stocks on to the government by selling out at key levels in expectation the government would step in when there was a sudden fall, said Every, who pointed out that Tuesday's sell-off started just after the Shanghai Composite hit the psychologically important 4,000-point level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Louis Tse, a director of VC Brokerage, concurred that a sell-off was coming after last week's rally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market had been bought up to near the 4,000 points," Tse said. "The buying subsides near 4,000. Those who bought stocks near 3,500 or 3,600 sell at that juncture."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the pattern was likely to repeat even with the </span><span class="s3">China Securities</span><span class="s1"> Finance Corp stepping in to prop up prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government supports the market, but I think 4,000 is the limit. I don't think the government will spend too much beyond that," Tse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese media reported the government planned to reduce buying in the stock market as volatility fell, which might have triggered the sell-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Bearish messages have been spreading since [Monday night]. It seems some people played safe and chose to cash out," said Eric Wu, a private equity analyst in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market sentiment is quite weak. A rumour, no matter true or not, will trigger a sell-off. That is what happened [on Tuesday]," said Zhou Jianhua, a market strategist at </span><span class="s3">Central China Securities Holdings</span><span class="s1"> in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Meanwhile, concern about capital outflow following the sharp devaluation of the yuan is still an overhang in the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That overhang is showing up in tighter market liquidity, with the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday injecting 120 billion yuan into the financial system in the biggest such boost since January last year, after a spike in the interbank lending rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index fell 1.43 per cent. Sentiment was cautious, with turnover topping just HK$80 billion, about two-thirds of the average in the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The H-share index dropped 1.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's four once-acquisitive conglomerates - </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CEFC China Energy</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Wanda Group</span><span class="s1"> - have been excluded from this year's Fortune 500 list, taking another blow on top of piling debt and intense government scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortune magazine, which compiles the list of the 500 largest companies in the world by revenue released on Thursday, said it axed the firms as “some of them have been under legal or regulatory investigations because of illicit operations and are having operational difficulties” even though their revenues were high enough to help them make the list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the quartet, Anbang was included in the list for the first time last year at number 139, while CEFC climbed from 349 in 2014 to 222 last year. HNA rose from 464 in 2015 to 170 last year, and Wanda edged up from 385 in 2016 to 380 last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conglomerates touted their inclusion among the ranks of the world's greatest companies, as the Fortune 500 list is highly regarded in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HNA Group and </span><span class="s3">Wanda Group</span><span class="s1"> are similar in that their excessive leveraged expansion and irrational offshore investments have led to financing difficulties,” Fortune said in an article on its Chinese-language website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang, CEFC, HNA and Wanda did not immediately respond to request for comments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four companies went on a shopping spree of flashy overseas assets from Manhattan's landmark Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel to stakes in Russia's top oil producer Rosneft starting from 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The aggressive acquisitions eventually drew scrutiny from the Chinese government in late 2016, as it cracked down on debt-fuelled outbound investments amid intensifying capital outflow. The country's foreign exchange stockpile lost about US$1 trillion from mid-2014 to early 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pressured by the government, the debt-laden </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> has been looking to offload around US$13 billion worth of assets, including stakes in the world's largest hotel operator </span><span class="s3">Hilton Worldwide</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, the owner of US theatre chain AMC as well as Hollywood studio </span><span class="s3">Legendary Entertainment</span><span class="s1">, has also unwound assets ranging from stakes in Spanish soccer club Atletico Madrid to development projects in London and Australia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC and Anbang were less fortunate in getting away from the government's direct intervention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese insurance regulator took control of Anbang in February and detained its ex-chairman Wu Xiaohui, who later admitted fundraising fraud and embezzlement involving more than US$10 billion in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Ye Jianming, the chairman of CEFC, China's fourth-largest oil conglomerate, has been detained for questioning, the Post reported in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortune also excluded power producer China Guodian Corporation, which announced a merger with </span><span class="s3">Shenhua Group</span><span class="s1"> in August 2017, </span><span class="s3">Shanxi Coking Coal Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">New China Life Insurance</span><span class="s1"> and China General Technology Group.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing will not devalue the yuan much more as further cheapening of the currency may not help boost exports and might have adverse ramifications, said Hong Kong's financial services chief.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The level of devaluation last week was small compared with other currencies such as the Korean won or the Malaysian ringgit, which have devalued by 10 to 20 per cent against the US dollar in recent months. I do not expect Beijing to devalue the yuan substantially in the near future as that may create more problems than help the mainland economy," Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> last Tuesday carried out a shock devaluation of the yuan and made its reference rate more market driven. As a result, the yuan lost about 3 per cent last week, its biggest weekly fall since 1994. Some analysts expect Beijing to bring the yuan down to about 6.80, from the 6.40 level at present, amounting to a 10 per cent devaluation that they say is necessary to make any meaningful difference to exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think Beijing plans to devalue the yuan too much to boost exports because there are other better alternatives to achieve that goal," Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For some small economies, currency devaluation might be useful in boosting exports but such a strategy would not work for a big economy like China. Besides, a substantial devaluation of the yuan would push up import prices and may lead to capital outflow, which would do more harm than good."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hence Chan believes Beijing would like to see a stable yuan. Following the surprise move last week, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has increased the reference rate - the midprice for the yuan's exchange rate to the US dollar around which the currency can fall or rise 2 per cent - for five straight trading days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A falling yuan has led many Hongkongers to change their yuan deposits to other currencies. There have also been fewer dim sum bond issues lately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These may be short-term phenomena only. I believe that when the yuan stabilises, depositors and investors will come back for yuan products. Hong Kong's status as a leading offshore yuan centre would not be affected by the devaluation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also said many foreign investors had told him that they were not overly worried about the stock market volatility on the mainland and Beijing's moves to rescue the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many foreign investors have taken a wait-and-see approach on the mainland stock market, which is why turnover has become thinner these days. They will come back when the uncertainties are over," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many private equity funds have become more active recently as valuations have become more reasonable."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the Hong Kong government would deliver a report early next year on steps to encourage start-ups and how regulations would need to change to encourage companies to use new internet tools and social media for crowd-funding, internet lending and other related services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government is very keen to promote start-ups and we will announce regulatory policy on these early next year," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves ended a two-month rise in May, hitting their lowest level since December 2011 amid a weakening yuan and as speculation mounted over a rate rise by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forex reserves fell US$27.9 billion to US$3.19 trillion last month, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decline - larger than expected - came after the reserves posted gains in March and April, but the drop was smaller than the US$28.6 billion seen in February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has been under weakening pressure against the US dollar since last month amid expectations the Fed would raise rates following an increase in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, strengthened by 3 per cent last month. The firmer greenback led the yuan to weaken 1.5 per cent, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement earlier on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, uncertainty surrounding a referendum in Britain on June 23 over whether it should remain in the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> has also helped to lift the greenback, adding volatility to the global market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xie Yaxuan, chief economist at China Merchants Securities, said the dollar might remain strong this month and into July, which might further weaken the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">May's forex drop was also much less than the US$100 billion decline in December and January, when the central bank's lack of clear policy direction spooked the market and triggered capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the central bank enhanced policy transparency and stepped up market communication, market participants have a deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of the yuan's exchange rate,” the bank said in its earlier statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Therefore, despite the weakened yuan/dollar since May due to external factors, market expectations have remained largely stable.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Minsheng Securities said in a note the data did not indicate any deterioration in forex reserves, although there were signs of expectations of the yuan's deprecation, reducing the challenge the central bank faced compared to earlier in the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also said the impact of any rate rise was expected to be much milder than in December, and neither China nor the US favoured a dramatic change in the yuan's exchange rate.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Big buying orders for Hong Kong dollars overnight saw the local currency bounce back on Thursday morning, ending a five-day falling streak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar was trading at 7.8099 at 10am after hitting 7.8294 at midnight, the lowest level in eight and a half years. The currency had fallen 0.88 per cent over the previous five days due to capital outflow and worries over the mainland China and local economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo Cho-yan, director of Tung Shing Futures, said there were big buying orders for Hong Kong dollars at 2am, when it was close to the 7.83 level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The big buying orders may well be allies of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to prevent the local currency from falling below 7.83 which is an important supporting level," Lo said. "This has stabilised the local currency, allowing to bounce back for the first time in a week, by more than 200 basis points."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The long-term view of the currency also improved on Thursday morning but remains bearish, with 12-month forward contracts trading at 7.88 at 10am, improved from 7.89 on Wednesday, which was the weakest since 1999.The weak Hong Kong dollar has attracted some speculators to try to bet on attacking the pegJasper Lo, Tung Shing Futures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lo said the forward market showed there were still traders who believed the peg could not be kept and the forwards were thus trading beyond the weak end of the peg at 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the peg, the HKMA will use its HK$3.3 trillion Exchange Fund to intervene whenever the currency edges close to 7.75 or 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The weak Hong Kong dollar has attracted some speculators to try to bet on attacking the peg," Lo said. "They may not win but they are trying to push the currency to the weak end and force the HKMA to intervene which may drive the interest rate up and hurt the stock markets. They are using similar strategies as were seen in the 1998 Asian financial crisis. The market will continue to be volatile."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> said in a research report that selling pressure against the Hong Kong dollar had been intensifying with FX options reporting a cumulative notional volume of US$15 billion over three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We revise our USD/HKD forecast to 7.85 for 2016 as a whole and revise our three-month Hibor forecast up," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three-month Hibor rose to a fresh five-year high at 0.62679 per cent on Thursday, after hitting 0.55 per cent on Wednesday. Six-month Hibor rose to 0.88 per cent on Thursday and 12-month rose to 1.26 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan continued to fall on Thursday morning to trade at 6.6033 at 10 am, following falls of 0.15 per cent on Wednesday and 0.13 per cent on Tuesday. The currency gained 0.5 per cent on Monday and was up 1 per cent last week after </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> intervention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan was unchanged, trading at 6.5778.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spread between the onshore and offshore yuan has narrowed down to 255 basis points, down from a record 1,400 basis points on January 7.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan mid-price against the US dollar at 6.5585 on Thursday morning, 7 basis points weaker than on Wednesday, when it set the mid-price 18 basis points stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It set the mid-price against the euro stronger by 241 basis points to 7.1386, and for every 100 yen weaker by 203 basis points at 5.6037. The mid-price against the pound was set 260 basis points weaker at 9.3247.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent either side of the mid-price for the day.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gorvy said that in 2013, Asian billionaires who had never bought at auctions were making bids of over US$100 million for Francis Bacon's Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) in New York. They were outbid, as were those Asian bidders who bid for Monet's Meule (1891) on November 16, but it was clear they wanted big brand names in art that could withstand downturns, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though Sotheby's Hong Kong held its first sale of Impressionist and early 20th-century art in 2010, auction houses do not bring Western art for sale here regularly. That may change because of the success enjoyed by Western galleries during Art Basel Hong Kong and high-profile purchases abroad by collectors such as Liu Yiqian.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shaun Rein, managing director of CMR, a market intelligence firm based in Shanghai, said demand for Western art is linked to the current capital outflow from the mainland as the yuan hit an eight-year low against the US dollar this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Chinese market is really weak right now and everyone is trying to diversify from China-generated revenue and the renminbi.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This column has argued ad nauseam that anyone who expects China to open up to free flows of cross-border capital will have a long wait.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But before I shut up on the topic, let's see what would happen if Beijing were to announce tomorrow that it was scrapping all its controls on capital movements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the recent opening initiatives, those controls are considerable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Every category of flow - whether by residents or non-residents, inflows or outflows - retains some approval requirement or quota in China," noted </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> researchers in a recent working paper. "By comparison with other emerging markets, the existence of restrictions remains pervasive."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If those restrictions were abolished tomorrow, foreign investors would certainly sit up and take notice. With no more quotas for inward portfolio investments, and no more mandatory lock-up periods following asset sales, the big international index compilers like MSCI would announce the inclusion of China's onshore equity and debt markets in their global benchmark indices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, every asset manager, pension fund and insurance company in the world that benchmarks its investment performance against an international index would have to reweight its portfolio, allocating assets to China's onshore markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gauging the likely size of the resulting inflows is tricky, but in April Monitor estimated they would amount to "hundreds of billions of US dollars". That's at least 1.2 trillion yuan, or about 2.4 per cent of China's gross domestic product.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time there would be outflows. At the moment, all but around 500 billion yuan of China's savings - or more than 99 per cent - must be invested domestically.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's hardly the optimal allocation," notes London Business School professor Avinash Persaud, who says the relaxation of controls would trigger significant outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Again, putting a figure on the probable exodus is tough, but in April Monitor reckoned the capital outflow could reach 9 trillion yuan, or 18 per cent of China's GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, you don't have to accept my back-of-a-napkin sums. The financial boffins at the IMF have spent far more time and put far more brain power into estimating the likely size of capital flows should China scrap its restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They calculate that foreign investors would pump funds worth anywhere between 1.7 and 9.9 per cent of China's GDP into the onshore debt and equity markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clearly the influx of so much money would risk a severe case of domestic financial indigestion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But, warn the IMF staffers, the volume of inflows would be dwarfed by the size of China's investment outflows. They reckon a simple rebalancing of Chinese portfolio allocations could trigger outflows of between 2.6 and 7.3 per cent of GDP into global equity markets, while debt outflows could be anywhere between 10.5 and 21 per cent of China's GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even allowing for the relatively small proportion of China's stock market that floats freely, and the captive nature of much of China's domestic bond market, the IMF's researchers still estimate that gross outflows could reach 15 per cent of China's GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offset against likely inflows, that means the net movement of funds following any abolition of China's capital controls would be an outflow of between 4.1 and 8.2 per cent of GDP. That's as much as 4.3 trillion yuan, or almost US$700 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To withstand such violent capital turbulence, China would need a solid banking system, highly developed capital markets and a well balanced economy. It has none.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the IMF researchers note: "Capital account liberalisation has historically often been followed by exchange rate or banking crises."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China would be no different.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's currency fell against the US dollar on Monday, ahead of the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> two-day policy board meeting which concludes on Wednesday, where interest rates will likely increase for the second time in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan in Shanghai traded at 6.9087 to the US dollar at 10.15 am, 0.03 per cent weaker than Friday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan in Hong Kong traded at 6.9285 to the US dollar at 10.15 am, 0.03 per cent weaker than on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">on Monday set the yuan reference point against the US dollar at 6.9086, 1.14 basis points or 0.17 per cent weaker than Friday's fixing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent either side of the reference point for the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has been under pressure following the election of Donald Trump and renewed strength in the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> 10-year bonds rose to their highest levels since June last year and the US dollar index reached peaks not seen since 2004.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Curbs designed to prevent yuan flows from leaking out of mainland will likely accelerate next year with the US dollar's continued ascent, Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other currency trading, the Japanese yen rose on Monday 0.06 per cent to 115.25 yen per dollar at 10.15 am, continuing its rally on rising bond yields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed's meeting later this week is "the most important event for the yen," likely to solidify the US dollar's appreciation going forward into next year, according to Innes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's latest efforts to crack down on capital outflows by making it harder for mainlanders to buy insurance products abroad are unlikely to make much difference, according to analysts and industry insiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They argue that the new measures might even worsen the problem by prompting mainland residents to transfer cash abroad through alternative underground channels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-run media reported on Monday that China's insurance industry regulator had recently launched a probe into illegal sales of Hong Kong insurance products on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That followed an announcement over the weekend that state-backed UnionPay, the mainland's biggest bank card provider, had banned customers from using its services to buy investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong with immediate effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UnionPay bans mainlanders from using card to buy insurance investment products in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2041311/unionpay-bans-mainlanders-using-card-buy-insurance-investment]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authorities had already capped insurance purchases overseas using UnionPay cards at the equivalent of US$5,000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The mainland authorities want to tighten further capital controls," said Bernard Chan, the president of Hong Kong-based Asia Financial Holdings and Asia Insurance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are seeing an explosive growth in Hong Kong's insurance sales to mainland visitors. I'm talking about more than double-digit growth, which is not normal."[The new measures] may be counterproductive by prompting more outflows through unregulated channels where outflow may not be as effectively blockedGoldman Sachs analysts</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainlanders have been pouring in to Hong Kong to buy insurance products as a way of skirting Beijing's strict capital controls and transferring money out of the country. Although China imposes an annual limit of US$50,000 or equivalent for each individual to convert from yuan, overseas foreign currency purchases through UnionPay cards are exempt from the cap.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese buyers have been free to swipe credit or debit cards issued by UnionPay at Hong Kong-based insurers when they purchase large life insurance policies denominated in foreign currency. UnionPay then deducts the equivalent amount of yuan from their mainland bank accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premiums on these policies can range from US$50,000 to above US$1 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Buyers can then immediately cash in their new insurance policy at certain banks, receiving a loan worth of up to 80 per cent of the policy's face value. They also have the option of cancelling the policy within a short time period in return for a cash refund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts from </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> doubt how effective the authorities' new curbs on insurance purchases may be in slowing the capital outflow, and fear it may instead make things worse.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The move is unlikely to reduce FX outflow by a significant amount, in our view," said Goldman analysts in a research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the one hand, they said total premiums paid by mainlanders for Hong Kong insurance products were "relatively modest" in the first half of the year compared with the total outflow from China during the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, the new measures risked "public misinterpretation of policy intent" and could "potentially be counterproductive by prompting more outflows through unregulated channels where outflow may not be as effectively blocked," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, "a much larger amount of stealth outflows in China is likely to have been facilitated by trading companies who maintain part of their net export proceeds offshore, possibly without the required reporting or documentation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An insurance sales agent in Hong Kong, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, agreed with Goldman's assessment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think the restriction could work in preventing mainland money leaving the country," she said. "It might instead drive the panic. You know, there are a lot of alternative methods to bypass the capital controls and people are inventive."We are seeing an explosive growth in Hong Kong's insurance sales to mainland visitorsBernard Chan, president, Asia Financial Holdings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purchases of insurance products by mainland visitors in Hong Kong hit HK$30.1 billion in the first half of 2016, up 116 per cent compared with the same period last year, according to recent statistics from the city's insurance regulator. The figure was almost equal to 2015's total amount of HK$31.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of them [mainlanders] consider the Hong Kong insurance more as an investment product, in order to hedge against the yuan's depreciation risk and move money offshore," Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, the currency's depreciation became more pronounced, falling 1.7 per cent versus the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the same month, China's foreign currency reserves may have fallen by around US$40 billion, following a drop of US$19 billion in September, due to "both capital outflows and negative valuation efforts", said Larry Hu, China economist for Macquarie Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the latest estimates by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">, China's foreign exchange outflows may have accelerated to close to US$80 billion in September and maintained the same pace in October, given that the yuan's rapid fall against the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese people have used myriad illicit methods to evade the strict limits on outflows and disguise money transfers, including underground banking, fake trade deals, service transactions, and mergers and acquisitions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wenzhou is again seeking the central government's permission for its residents to make direct investments into properties and production facilities abroad, after failing in its previous attempt a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Granting that clearance would mean Beijing would have to liberalise foreign-exchange controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Growing affluence is fuelling demand for investments, transactions and asset purchases across the globe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wenzhou, a boomtown for privately owned businesses, announced in January of last year that local residents could convert yuan to foreign currencies to invest in overseas properties and to make foreign direct investments without enduring lengthy approval procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing ended the policy after just two weeks over fears that it would lead to a massive capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Wenzhou financial official confirmed yesterday that the city had reapplied to the central government for the liberalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai has also lobbied for an easing of foreign-exchange controls. An increasing number of city residents have expressed interest in overseas investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the long run, the policy change is a must due to mainlanders' growing desire for outbound asset purchases," said Guo Tianyong, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics. "But the central government is now worried about runaway investments abroad if the deregulation is implemented. Complaints about Chinese investors irrationally bidding up housing prices overseas are the last thing the officials want to hear."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is not freely convertible, and mainland investors cannot make foreign investments without complicated approval procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing began to encourage state-owned companies to invest abroad in 2007 when swelling foreign reserves were exacerbating inflation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Individuals are still barred from converting yuan into foreign currencies to buy properties or acquire production facilities abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During per the brief rule change in Wenzhou last year, a local resident could convert yuan in amounts up to US$3 million to make a foreign investment, but the money could not be invested in equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's slumbering stock market and government austerity measures in the property sector have dampened enthusiasm for domestic investments among the rich.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A day after President Donald Trump's tax plan for corporate America, more questions than answers remain on just how his vision will affect businesses. Economists and analysts also differed[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2091004/us-dollar-slides-trump-tax-plan-disappoints-due-lack] over whether the plan will lead to a flood of repatriation from China, exacerbating the capital flight that had only begun to ease after months of draconian government policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Trump administration's top economic adviser Gary Cohn and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday proposed to cut corporate income tax to 15 per cent[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2090972/trump-unveils-plan-cut-corporate-tax-rates-15-cent] from 35 per cent and apply a one-time low territorial tax rate on an estimated US$2.6 trillion of offshore profits that American businesses keep overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This will be big in impact," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. "Many companies leave their profits outside the US because of tax issues."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/27/ac6cf1e2-2b3f-11e7-acff-d77f13c4971d_image_hires_233854.jpg]About one in four American companies operating in China earn at least 25 per cent of their global income from the world's most populous nation, according to the 2017 China business climate survey report of 400 members by the American Chamber of Commerce in China and Bain &amp; Co.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A collective repatriation could lead to a stampede of the yuan for conversion into the dollar before fleeing offshore, testing the Chinese currency regulator's ability to stem the capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While the key is whether the government will let them convert yuan profits out, it's conflicting with China's priority to stem capital outflow," Rein said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move could also lure Chinese manufacturers to invest in the US, undermining the competitiveness of China's exports, </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1">'s financial research deputy dean Zhu Ning said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China must speed up its economic transformation and give up its old growth model of relying on exports," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not everybody agrees. The direct impact of the repatriation incentive might be limited for China, AXA Investment Managers' senior emerging Asia economist Aidan Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is not a tax haven like Hong Kong or Singapore where companies park their earnings to avoid high duties," Yao said. "Most US companies like </span><span class="s3">General Motors</span><span class="s1"> would reinvest their earnings in China as they are after the growth and huge market there, so I do not expect a tax repatriation from China-based US companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, if there is anything China's government is skilled at, it is maintaining the capital controls and reining in outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past year, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> had tightened capital controls to such an extent that carmaker </span><span class="s3">BMW</span><span class="s1"> reportedly complained in March of being unable to remit its profit back to Germany, even through legitimate channels under the regulator's rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese banks had simply stopped processing cross-border remittances until the government sees net yuan inflow at the end of each month. The requirement was only eased in mid-April[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2088772/china-eases-yuan-outflow-controls-sign-recovered-confidence] when the outflow pressures eased.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Capital control is not a common hinder to profit repatriation," said Jim Qiao, a corporate accountant at Dezan Shira &amp; Associates. "The deciding factor is your business strategy and focus, but not the duty rate that decides whether you want to repatriate or not."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additional reporting by Wendy Wu</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How foreign firms repatriate profits under Chinese law</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When a foreign company operates in China, its subsidiary often takes the form of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise. Such enterprises can repatriate their profits as dividends to the overseas holding entity when they turn a profit. Notably, tax will be incurred on both the profits of the business and the dividends paid to the holding company. Companies have to fulfil the requirements in China's company law and double tax agreements with the respective countries where they wish to repatriate dividends to.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under China's company law:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• Before dividends are repatriated, profit must have undergone an annual audit. A company has to provide the annual corporate income tax return to substantiate the distributable profit for the year;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• A company has to settle losses from previous years;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• A company has to allocate 10 per cent of its post-tax income to its reserve fund unless 50 per cent of its registered capital is already covered;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• A company has to have sufficient cash for dividend distribution; and</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• A company's board of directors has to approve the distribution through a board resolution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, according to the double tax agreements, China charges a 0 to 10 per cent dividends tax on the overseas repatriation of profits, depending on the stipulation of the relevant agreements. For instance, the tax rate with the United States is 10 per cent</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has been battling to keep the currency peg stable amid soaring hot money inflows during the past week's market rally and doesn't expect any let-up until the US raises interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said yesterday it had injected a combined HK$30 billion and bought US$4.4 billion worth of US dollars in the past week to weaken the Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The HKMA has to intervene in the currency because there's a lot of money flowing in from mainland China as well as from Europe and the US to invest in the stock market in Hong Kong, which reached record high turnover last week," Chan told a media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the trend would continue, with fund flows to increase after the launch of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen stocks through train, which was expected soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This will only end when the US raises interest rates, which may lead to capital outflow," Chan said.The HKMA has to intervene in the currency because there's a lot of money flowing in from mainland China as well as from Europe and the US to invest in the stock marketNorman Chan, HKMA chief</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the HKMA had bought US$110 billion worth of US dollars since 2008 to weaken the local currency because America's monetary easing policy, introduced after the financial crisis, had led to capital inflows. More recently, the money had been flowing in from the mainland, following Beijing's announcement two weeks ago that it would allow mainland funds to invest in the Hong Kong market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Bank executive director Andrew Fung said the HKMA had not only been intervening during the day, but also at night, when the US market was open.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This shows the recent inflows do not only come from the mainland but also from the US and European investors," Fung said. "This is natural as the local market remains cheap while the poor economic figures in China recently have led to speculation that there will be further interest rate cuts or other measures to boost the economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index nudged up 0.21 per cent, or 57.33 points, on Wednesday to finish at 27,618.22. Total turnover remained strong at HK$218.02 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hanging heavily over the market was a report on Wednesday morning that the mainland's first-quarter gross domestic product expanded by 7 per cent year on year, the slowest expansion since the first quarter of 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.24 per cent after earlier gains were reversed. But the H-share index, a gauge of mainland Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, rose 1.45 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts at Citi said they remained overweight on mainland China with its reasonable stock valuations, noting that all key metrics including price-earnings and price-book ratios were below historical averages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the five most-traded stocks were Tencent, which fell 2.23 per cent to end at HK$157.60, and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which dropped 0.14 per cent to HK$285.2. Both were among the star performers of the previous week that saw record turnover in the city's stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Energy and financial stocks rose. CNOOC and Sinopec both rose to three-month highs. </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> rose to a six-year high, up 4.86 per cent to close at HK6.91. </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> chimed in with a 4.39 per cent gain to HK$7.84.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Macau shares were battered, with casino operator Galaxy Entertainment down 2.01 per cent to HK$36.55, and peer Sands China down 2.47 per cent at HK$33.60.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A commentary carried by a Communist Party mouthpiece has lashed out against US President Donald Trump's new tax cut plan, accusing him of inciting a "tax war".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cuts, if approved by the </span><span class="s3">US Congress</span><span class="s1">, would "wreak chaos in the international taxation order", according to the commentary in the People's Daily newspaper on Friday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"From other countries' perspectives, the United States' tax cut is actually inciting a tax war," said the article by commentator Wei Liang. "To respond, some powerful countries may join the game to launch competitive tax cuts ... Such signs are already visible in Britain and France."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It added that the tax cut plan would undo "international efforts" in cracking down on cross-border tax avoidance and hurt some export-oriented economies as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though the commentary is not an official statement from the Chinese government, it reflects Beijing's concerns about the potential impact of Trump's tax proposal.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A commentary carried by a Communist Party mouthpiece has lashed out against US President Donald Trump's new tax cut plan, accusing him of inciting a “tax war”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cuts, if approved by the </span><span class="s3">US Congress</span><span class="s1">, would “wreak chaos in the international taxation order”, according to the commentary in the People's Daily newspaper on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Trump administration had on Thursday unveiled its tax proposal, which included cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 per cent from 35 per cent and streamlining individual tax brackets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump says he'll talk to Xi Jinping first before engaging Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2091409/trump-says-hell-talk-xi-jinping-first-engaging-taiwans]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“From other countries' perspectives, the United States' tax cut is actually inciting a tax war,” said the article by commentator Wei Liang. “To respond, some powerful countries may join the game to launch competitive tax cuts ... Such signs are already visible in Britain and France.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It added that the tax cut plan would undo “international efforts” in cracking down on cross-border tax avoidance and hurt some export-oriented economies as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though the commentary is not an official statement from the Chinese government, it reflects Beijing's concerns about the potential impact of Trump's tax proposal.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The plan offers a one-time tax break on corporate profits brought back to the US from overseas, which incentivises American businesses to bring their offshore operations back home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tax break would add to the pressure on China's capital outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tax burden that businesses in China face include a 17 per cent value-added tariff and 25 per cent income tax.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai has allowed six global hedge funds to raise yuan funds for overseas equity investments, likely to direct a capital outflow worth a combined US$3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city, which is aiming to transform itself into a global financial centre by 2020, officially embarked on a long-awaited qualified domestic limited partner (QDLP) scheme after obtaining approval from state regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the pilot run of the QDLP programme, foreign hedge funds may raise yuan capital in Shanghai through local branches and then convert the capital into foreign currencies to make investments in overseas equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to two people involved in the fundraising for the QDLP funds, six international hedge fund managers - including </span><span class="s3">Winton Capital Management</span><span class="s1">, Man Group, Marshall Wace, Citadel, and Och-Ziff Capital Management - were granted QDLP quotas of US$500 million each. The name of the sixth fund that received the QDLP quota is unknown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It now remains to be seen whether the funds are able to raise enough capital from "limited partners" on the mainland to fill those quotas. Man would not comment on the QDLP matter while the other four companies were not immediately available for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Financial Services Office would not comment on the QDLP progress and a source within the office said Tu Guangshao, a vice-mayor, preferred to be tight-lipped on the financial liberalisation during the initial stages of the pilot programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai began lobbying the central government last year to endorse its proposal for the QDLP project, a move to reinforce its bid to become an international financial hub. The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> set an initial total US$5 billion quota for the Shanghai QDLP pilot programme and it is believed the city hopes to see this quota increased.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are still technical problems to sort out, such as taxation and regulation," said an official source. "But the policy trend is that officials will encourage more cross-border capital flows through further liberalisation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai also aims to enlist the help of the global big names to develop the mainland's hedge fund sector, and a successful trial of the QDLP could be a boost for the domestic hedge fund industry which is still at a rudimentary stage of its evolution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has already launched programmes that enable foreign institutions to raise foreign capital to invest in domestic stocks and private-equity funds. The QDLP scheme, alongside the QDII (qualified domestic institutional investor) programme, allows domestic mutual funds to raise yuan capital for overseas equity purchases and were designed for mainland investors keen on allocating part of their funds to foreign stocks and financial derivatives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's a huge market for QDLP investors to tap, with abundant cash looking for proper investment targets," said Howhow Zhang, head of research at fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. "Local authorities and foreign funds need to convince cash-rich investors of the benefits from participating in the QDLP programme."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The QDLP scheme follows on the "through train" programme that aimed to allow mainland investors to buy Hong Kong stocks, and represented Shanghai's renewed efforts to facilitate cross-border capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the "through train" proposal, which was announced in 2007, has never been implemented owing to objections from the securities regulator which warned state leaders of a potential collapse on the A-share market, given mainland investors' frenzied buying of Hong Kong-listed stocks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global capital investment is being refocused back onto major US cities, particularly New York, amid the impact of Brexit and increasingly volatile markets around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Big Apple continues to offer the world's most sought after commercial real estate, absorbing US$24.3 billion in the first half, although that was a 6 per cent fall on the same period last year, according to the latest figures from property consultancy </span><span class="s3">Jones Lang LaSalle</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total global commercial property investment dropped 10 per cent in value during the period, to US$292 billion, said the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After NYC, Los Angeles ranked second most popular commercial destination in the US, with a huge 40 per cent rise in the period, to US$11.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The attraction the US has at present is that it is forecast to grow stronger than many of the European economies," said David Green-Morgan, Global Capital Markets Research director at JLL.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Brexit has obviously had an impact on the flows into the UK and being such a big market that has affected the overall European numbers."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though London volumes were 40 per cent down, it remains the world's second most popular city globally with US$13.2 billion worth of transactions in the first half, with a substantial drop off in foreign investors within that total.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The shift to the US market has also helped New York pull well away from its main rivals including London, Paris and Tokyo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most-notable deals highlighted by the JLL study included Chinese sovereign wealth </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1">'s US$886 million purchase of a 49 per cent stake in One New York Plaza, a downtown office tower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JLL said investors are increasingly interested in US cities which have developed specialties in certain industries such as Seattle, those around Silicon Valley and Dallas, as corporates tend to locate their activities close to talented workforces.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By region, globally the most notable increase has been in Asia Pacific where intra-regional flows have increased by 73 per cent in the first six months, the report shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If more volatility or uncertainties arise in other parts of the world, Asia Pacific's relatively stable collection of nation states and treaties could be viewed more favourably by international investors," said Elysia Tse, JLL's head of research and strategy for Asia Pacific.If more volatility or uncertainties arise in other parts of the world, Asia Pacific's relatively stable collection of nation states and treaties could be viewed more favourably by international investorsElysia Tse, JLL's head of research and strategy for Asia Pacific</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The majority of this investment is coming from China and Singapore and is flowing primarily south down to Australia, but also into Hong Kong from the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Morgan said he had not seen any great impact of the capital outflow controls introduced by the Chinese government in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the second quarter, China's (overseas) commercial investment rose 30 per cent compared to a year ago showing there is continued demand by Chinese investors for offshore properties," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The UK, the US and Australia remain the top three destinations for Chinese outbound capital, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A separate report from CBRE, meanwhile, shows despite overall softened demand, more than 30 per cent of newly leased space in Hong Kong's Central district during April-June period was taken by mainland Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dr Henry Chin, head of research at CBRE, Asia Pacific, said China's strong investment demand is driven by cheap domestic funding after several interest rate cuts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an unusual move, President Xi Jinping summoned the country's finance industry watchdogs and ordered them to take stock of risks and uphold regulatory vigilance, reflecting his deep concern about the dangers facing the mainland economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, April 28</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When people tout the virtues of a centrally planned economy as opposed to one shaped by the blind vagaries of market choice there is one compelling argument they can always adduce. It gets things done. Do we want 20 hydroelectric dams built? Consider them built. Do we want 40 new cement plants? Turn around. There they are. When you want mountains moved you want a central planner to run things.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I concede this advantage of central planning to Singapore and Shanghai any time that they wish to claim it. The Hong Kong way with lots of argument and filibuster and multi-year delays while people talk and talk and talk just doesn't cut it on the get-things-done-now scale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there are two crucial questions that central planning does not address, in fact, does not even consider. They are:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">(1) How can a small claque of leaders know for an entire economy what it is specifically that people really want to do?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">(2) How can they know when to stop doing it?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sometimes the first question can be answered without much dispute. For both Hong Kong and Singapore, for instance, the tasks were obvious after the second world war. Build the ports, the roads, the schools, the power plants and the homes and so raise the living standards of the people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How to counter the doomsters who say China has too much debt[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2052586/heres-how-counter-doomsters-who-say-china-has-too-much-debt]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But what about when all these things have been built and the living standards of the people have been raised to a rank within the world's 10 wealthiest economies, which is a status that both Hong and Singapore now enjoy? What then?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At that point the second question intrudes. Is it perhaps time to stop building so furiously? Perhaps we should explore new pursuits and perhaps letting people make their own choices for their own lives is a better way of doing so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is in addressing these questions that a market economy excels and, yes, it takes a lot of talk and still more talk. It involves making the wrong choices sometimes and then backtracking. It's not easy but that's the way forward and a market economy does this much better than a centrally planned one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland economy is now approaching the point where these questions cannot be avoided. For years it has built furiously, using more cement between 2011 and 2013 than all of the United States in the 20th century. It has more than twice the steel production capacity of the US and Europe combined and it has vast swathes of empty residential towers in almost every city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has, in short, a looming financial crisis. The money invested in these many excesses is gone. It can never be recovered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forget the statements, China's capital outflow is still enormous[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2070143/forget-statements-chinas-capital-outflow-still-enormous]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But while Beijing talks of curbing excess, what it has actually done is encourage yet more excess by opening the credit taps even wider in the vain hope that things will somehow magically come into balance while growth is yet maintained at a high level. I do not know whether President Xi really believes it can be done or whether he is just making a desperate gamble but I do know that picking on regulatory agencies to forestall a financial crisis will never work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leaving aside that both the chief securities and chief banking regulators are brand new to their posts while the 69-year-old head of the central bank is hardly likely to be a ball of reforming fire after 15 years in the job, these mainland regulatory agencies are traditionally more promoters than watchdogs of their charges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the problems were never regulatory anyway. They lay in a breakneck pace of state directed investment in rust-belt industries. Beijing didn't know when to stop. It doesn't even know how to stop.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will continue the current pace of normalising its monetary policy because the American economy is doing “exceptionally well,” though this will create a tougher economic environment for emerging markets including China, its former chair said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Normalisation of both short rates and the balance sheet are proceeding smoothly and, with the economy performing so well, Chair Powell and the [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)] are continuing the process of removing monetary accommodation to return the federal funds rate to a neutral stance,” Janet Yellen said via video during Caijing magazine's annual conference in Beijing, adding that she expected rates to rise by three to four times over the next year. “I expect that to continue over the next year unless there are significant economic surprises.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US Fed is scheduled to next meet on December 20, so Yellen's comment implies a rate increase then, followed by up to three increases in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her comments came as Beijing is scrambling to deal with a variety of tough issues, including the unprecedented trade war with Washington, a decade-low economic growth rate, the eroding confidence of private sector and market investors, and the resurfacing of capital outflow and yuan depreciation pressure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The top Chinese leadership switched its policy focus to stabilising economic growth in July, including an easing monetary policy that is shrinking the gap between US and China interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, for instance, has cut its required reserve ratio - the amount of money that banks are required to hold at the central bank - four times so far this year, trying to maintain market liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> also implemented a series of measures to increase loans and reduce the financing cost of smaller, private-sector firms that are struggling with slower growth and rising costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is on the way of easing monetary policy somewhat,” Yellen said, noting the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> “is trying to resist the equation of [yuan} appreciation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has also tightened its control of the capital account and reintroduced the counter-cyclical factor in calculating the daily midpoint of the yuan's trading range, to curb the Chinese currency's decline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The midpoint of yuan was weakened by 196 pips to 6.9629 on Tuesday, re-approaching the psychologically important mark of 7 to the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed takes account of US domestic demand, not global demand, in making its rate decisions, Yellen said. However, if international factors influence US domestic demand, then it would affect the Fed's thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outlook for further Fed rate hikes is supported by the American economy, which is performing “exceptionally well,” Yellen said, citing a 50-year low unemployment rate of 3.7 per cent, and inflation settling near the Fed's target of 2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Opinion: Which is scarier, Powell's rising interest rates or Trump's trade war?[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2170368/which-scarier-us-fed-raising-interest-rates-or-donald-trump]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The former Fed chair warned capital flows out of emerging markets are “simply inevitable,” with those countries with “weaker macro fundamentals” coming under the most pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currencies of countries like Argentina and Turkey have been under significant stress because of the appreciation of the dollar due to the Fed's rate hikes and a stronger US economy supported by a corporate tax cut and government spending stimulus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yellen attributed the weaker yuan to a combination of domestic and international factors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While tighter US monetary policy has pushed up the dollar relative to most currencies, including the yuan, “China is also suffering from something like a [growth] slowdown, not only due to trade, but also … a slowdown in infrastructure spending,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese central bank's policy easing[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2166008/worlds-two-largest-economies-diverge-china-leaves-key-interest] is “placing downward pressure on the currency and has triggered capital outflows,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite its recent strong performance, Yellen estimated that the potential longer-term US growth rate without generating inflation is still around 2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yellen also warned that the impact of the ongoing trade war between China and the US is a threat to global economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I'm concerned about trade relations. Frankly, I consider it to be a lose-lose situation,” Yellen said. “Hopefully, we will be able to find ways to work through it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yellen said that the trade practises of China and other countries are not the reason for the large US trade deficit. Instead, the trade gap is largely due to the fact that Americans spend more than they produce.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chief economist of </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> allayed concerns about a steady depreciation of the yuan following a one-off devaluation of the currency on Tuesday, cooling speculation of a currency war with other countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> cited the mainland's economic fundamentals as a strong cushion against a potential further fall in the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Based on fundamentals, our key economic data all supported a stable yuan," said PBOC chief economist Ma Jun, in a commentary published by the state newspaper People's Daily. "China's economic fundamentals obviously fare much better than those economies which face huge pressure to devalue their currencies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that China'scurrent-account surplus, huge foreign reserves and a healthy fiscal situation would prevent the country's currency from being locked in a downward spiral.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank also said in a statement on Wednesday morning that there was no basis for a sustainedyuan depreciation based on the international and domestic economic situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said the yuan's position was supported by a number of factors such as a moderately fast growth of 7 per cent in the first half, a trade surplus of US$305.2 billion, growing demands of yuan in global trade and investment and the assimilation of the US Fed's forthcoming interest rate hike, as well as China's large foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing weakened the yuan's daily fixing against the US dollar by nearly 2 per cent on Tuesday and announced the system for setting the daily midpoint of the currency exchange rate would be based on the previous day's close and market makers' quotes, rather than the central bank's own calculation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would further improve the yuan's pricing mechanism, maintain its "normal fluctuations" and keep it basically stable at reasonable levels, the central bank said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Devaluing the yuan by 1.6 per cent following a nearly 2 per cent depreciation on Tuesday sent fresh shockwaves around the global financial markets. The two-day depreciation is the biggest since 2005 when China unpegged the yuan against the US dollar and moved to the "managed float" regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move was interpreted as a boosting measure to spur the country's exports, which fell 8.3 per cent in July, boding ill for the mainland's economic outlook this year's second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A weaker yuan could make Chinese outbound shipments more attractive since they would become less expensive on overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other currencies such as South Korea's won and the Australian dollar are also depreciating, sparking worries of a tit-for-tat race among the economies to devalue their own currencies to chase more export volumes in the global market ahead of expected interest hikes in US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Following the one-off devaluation which could last two or three days, a similar move isn't likely to be used again in the coming months," a source with a money market advisory firm, who is close to the central bank said. "It will be a gradual depreciation of yuan for a long period of time. But an economic recovery will help China stem the downward trend of yuan."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan hit a four-year low on Wednesday falling to 6.43 per US dollar after the central bank set the daily midpoint reference even weaker. The currency traded 6.57 per US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shao Yu, chief economist with </span><span class="s3">Orient Securities</span><span class="s1">, said it was not advisable for Beijing to enter into currency war against other economies because a hefty and strong devaluation of yuan would cause a huge capital outflow detrimental to the country's financial system and economic development, which would drag down Beijing's pace of efforts to internationalise the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a sensitive timing now. A fast devaluation would lead to the depreciation of yuan assets and cause funds to rush to flow out," Shao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Yang, a Guotai Junan analyst, said the central bank would face a stern test as it was tasked with bolstering the faltering economy and controlling financial risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has been a source of currency stability in Asia during past crises and Chinese authorities propped it up earlier this year to deter capital outflows and make a case for official reserve status at the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move to reform the midpoint reference setting system was seen as Beijing's latest effort to reinforce its push for the renminbi to be included in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> said that greater exchange rate flexibility was important for China as it strived to give market forces a decisive role in the economy amid the country's rapid integration into the global financial system, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Immediately after Wednesday's announcement, Vietnam widened the dong's daily trading bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Asian currencies were also lower on Wednesday in response, with Indonesia's rupiah and Malaysia's ringgit hitting 17-year lows, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars at six-year lows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Indonesia's central bank</span><span class="s1"> pinned the rupiah's fall directly on the yuan devaluation and said it would step into the foreign exchange and bond markets to guard against volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks slipped on Wednesday morning, as the yuan's depreciation fuelled fears that money could flow out of the country's equity markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent to 3,910.30 points in morning trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> index dropped 1.8 per cent to 24,068.29 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's policy shift to support exporters and stem the deepest economic slowdown since 1990 has heightened the risk of competitive currency devaluations as global demand wanes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing said on Wednesday that the recent depreciation of the yuan would have a help to stimulate Chinese exports.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of mainland shares reported record redemptions this month, a development that may discourage asset managers from launching new products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The withdrawal of funds from the ETF is in line with a broader capital outflow from Asian equities, after the yield of 10-year US treasuries rose following the US Federal Reserve's suggestion it could reduce its stimulus measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors have withdrawn 800 million yuan (HK$1 billion) from the FTSE China A50 Fund this month, the most since its inception in August last year. CSOP Asset Management manages the fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is surely a blow to the industry as CSOP's ETF has been the most favoured by institutions, partly because the FTSE A50 focuses on selected companies only, and its ETF can be used for hedging purpose in Singapore," said a market participant who declined to be identified. "Many institutions may now postpone launches, fearing they will not meet their fundraising targets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a report, Jefferies Investment Advisers said mutual fund and ETF investors were net sellers over the past week, disposing of US$1.6 billion of investments. Over the past four weeks, they have withdrawn US$10 billion from equity markets in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The volatile environment is tough for asset managers planning launches of renminbi qualified foreign institutional investors products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Hang Seng Bank became the first local bank to obtain an investment quota under the amended RQFII scheme. It said it would use its fundraising allocation to launch an RQFII ETF in two or three month at the earliest. In addition, China Universal Asset Management had been planning to launch its RQFII ETF this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing granted fundraising allocations under the RQFII scheme worth 15.6 billion yuan to 14 financial institutions last month, the biggest monthly quota this year, according to the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which is responsible for managing the nation's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of mid-June, 95.7 billion yuan had been granted under the scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We don't see the immediate return to competitiveness of the ETFs in terms of fee structure and return, when compared to either onshore debt or dim sum bonds, especially at a time of high market volatility," said Z-Ben Advisors analyst Cindy Qu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland asset managers and foreign institutions have been clamouring to launch their own RQFII products since Beijing said in December last year it would grant an extra 200 billion yuan of RQFII quota. The scheme was opened to foreign institutions in a bid to revive the onshore bond and equity markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China does not need a "premature" shift to services to rebalance its economy, but instead needs continued industrialisation to lift its labour productivity and technology, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> said Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many still argue that China needs to rebalance its economy from investment to consumption to sustain high growth. However, what matters for sustained growth in the long run is productivity, not the structure of aggregate demand," HSBC economists John Zhu and Qu Hongbin said in research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although China is a very large economy, productivity per worker is still low due to a lesser stock of capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Given China's current stage of development, more investment will be needed, not less," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other side, the recent increase of the services sector to more than half of China's GDP was more due to "a cyclical decline in industry" than to "a structural improvement in services productivity".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A deliberate shift away from manufacturing would in fact remove an important mechanism of productivity catch-up," </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China needs industrial upgrading, and not a premature shift from industry to services," the bank added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong dollar continued its downward trend and briefly hit 7.8001 in early trade Monday morning, the lowest level since September 2011. It traded at 7.7998 at 9:30 am.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency has been falling since last week due to the capital outflow, as investors take money out of the city after the US began its interest-rate rise cycle in mid-December. The stock market has slumped in Hong Kong and China since the beginning of this year, causing investors to withdraw money from Hong Kong, resulting in a weaker Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lot has happened in 2016. In January, Taiwan's independence-leaning Tsai Ing-wen won the island's presidential election by a landslide; in July, an international court handed down a landmark ruling against Beijing's claims in the South China Sea, and in November, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton to become the United States' next leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As we usher in 2017, our team of reporters have put together a list of key China issues to watch out for in the new year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has held growth steady at 6.7 per cent throughout the first three quarters of 2016, but it is still facing big challenges as the economy continues to slow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is trying to keep the country's gross domestic product growth above 6.5 per cent, a floor set to double its economic size by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s interest rate rise in December and two or three more expected increases in 2017 have forced China to reintroduce capital outflow restrictions to defend the yuan. It has also squeezed room for credit easing, with the government now tightening controls on liquidity as preventing financial risks moves up its agenda.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why is China so afraid of US Fed's interest rate increase?[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2054482/why-should-beijing-be-nervous-about-us-fed-just-look-what]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More proactive fiscal policy, especially infrastructure construction, will be the main tool supporting growth. In 2017, the government may also raise the fiscal deficit ratio, issue more municipal and special construction bonds, and leverage private capital inflow through public-private partnership projects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China will stay on high alert against asset bubbles, especially in property. It will likely take measures such as increasing the down payment ratio and property taxes to cool speculation in the big cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One worrying sign on the horizon is that recent property restrictions have slowed sales and may hit property investment - an old economic driver - in the first half of 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is expected to help its preferred choice for Hong Kong's next chief executive[http://www.scmp.com/topics/chief-executive-election-2017] garner as many votes as possible in the election on March 26, according to political analyst Lau Siu-kai, emeritus professor of sociology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing would do so to avoid a repeat of the scenario in the previous election in 2012, when Leung Chun-ying won the chief executive race with a record low number of votes - 689 - from the 1,200-strong election committee, Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah and Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor would hence not both be allowed to stand for election, according to Lau, as each additional candidate meant the winner would get fewer votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive race open to all, top Beijing official for Hong Kong affairs hints[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2058173/chief-executive-race-open-all-top-beijing-official-hong-kong]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Candidates' popularity mattered as well, Lau said, which meant New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Judge Woo Kwok-hing had almost no chance of landing the city's top job even if they managed to secure the 150 votes required to run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One focal point for the upcoming election is whether Beijing will adjust its hardline stance towards Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts expect Beijing's stance to remain the same even after Leung relinquishes his role as the city's leader. Other believe Beijing will soften its stance, pointing to the olive branch it has extended to prominent pan-democratic figures when it promised this month[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2050238/beijing-expected-grant-permanent-home-return-permits-current] to grant them all permanent home-return permits for the first time in decades.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-strait relations is set to be affected by a range of factors in the new year, among them US president-elect Donald Trump's China policy, Beijing's resolve to punish Taiwanese pro-independence forces and the independence-leaning ruling Democratic Progressive Party's performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even before taking office, Trump has already created huge waves in relations among Beijing, Washington and Taipei by receiving a congratulatory call[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2051416/trump-talks-taiwan-president-move-risking-blowup-china] from the self-ruled island's President Tsai Ing-wen in early December. Days later, he went on to question whether the United States should continue[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2053740/trump-questions-one-china-policy] its "one China" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump's freewheeling and unorthodox style of diplomacy threatens to make Taiwan more of a victim than a beneficiary as further backlash is expected from Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reunification is inevitable, Beijing warns Taiwan[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2057744/reunification-inevitable-beijing-warns-taiwan]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has shut all official communication channels[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1981525/beijing-cuts-ma-era-cross-strait-communication-channel-taiwan] with Taipei since Tsai became president in May, after she refused to acknowledge the "1992 consensus" on which cross-strait ties are based. The consensus is an understanding between Beijing and Taiwan that there is only "one China" but that each side could have its own interpretation of what constitutes "China".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taipei says Beijing has also limited the number of mainland tourists to the island, hitting its already-struggling economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, small West African nation Sao Tome and Principe severed ties[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2056276/taiwan-losing-out-diplomatic-war-beijing-sao-tome] with Taipei in a move Tsai has described as Beijing's diplomatic suppression aimed at Taiwan. Last March, Beijing resumed relations[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/1926877/gambia-and-beijing-rekindle-ties] with Gambia, another former Taiwan ally in Africa. Taipei has diplomatic ties with just 21 countries now, mostly small states.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan's economic outlook appears dim and its international space is also narrowing as Beijing looks set to continue its hardline stance towards the island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, if Beijing refuses to budge on cross-strait relations, we will see if Tsai will soften her stance instead and adopt a more flexible approach in dealing with the mainland.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It looks like a bumpy road ahead for Sino-US relations in 2017 after Donald Trump's inauguration as President of the United States on January 20, given his provocative remarks on China and his choice of hawkish China policy advisers so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No date has been set for bilateral visits involving either Trump or China's President Xi Jinping, but the two heads of state are bound to meet at multilateral gatherings in the coming year, such as July's G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, or the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference (</span><span class="s3">Apec</span><span class="s1">) summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How the two leaders greet and interact with each other and whether they hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of these summits will be an indicator of the health of Sino-US ties.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why Trump's blunt approach will put US relations with China on surer footing[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2056841/why-trumps-blunt-approach-will-put-us-relations-china-surer]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the trade imbalance and loss of American jobs, and vowed to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. He has also threatened to impose up to 45 per cent taxes on Chinese imports and asked American firms like Apple to move their manufacturing bases back to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Trump does penalise China in trade, some observers say Beijing may retaliate by similarly cutting US imports or sanctioning US firms, thereby starting a "trade war".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incoming US president sees the "one China" principle as a bargaining chip to pressure Beijing into trade concessions, but Beijing has warned that the principle is a bottom line not open for compromise and also the basis of Sino-US relations[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2053908/no-more-basis-sino-us-ties-if-one-china-policy-breached].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new year may see tensions across the Taiwan Strait build up further, with more American arms sales to Taipei, more controversial comments from Trump about the self-ruled island in relation to Beijing, or even meetings between American and Taiwanese leaders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such moves might up Trump's ante in negotiations with China, but could also provoke strong reactions from Beijing - even retaking the island by force in a worst-case scenario. Beijing still views Taiwan as a renegade province to be retaken by force if necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How a snub of the one-China policy almost led Beijing and US into war in the 1990s[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2054141/how-snub-one-china-policy-almost-led-beijing-and-us-war]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other buttons Trump might seek to push with Beijing upon taking office include meeting Tibet's exiled Dalai Lama, raising China's human rights record or commenting on Hong Kong's democratisation process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the two global powers hope to manage their differences and work well under the Trump administration, they will have to seek new areas for cooperation and common ground on which they can build trust.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During US President Barack Obama's administration, he and Xi both agreed on climate change and cooperated well in advancing related policies. Trump can consider working with Beijing to counter terrorism and on coming to resolutions in the Middle East peace process.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prospects for international trade have taken a hit with the victory of Donald Trump, who has vowed during his US presidential campaign to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership[http://www.scmp.com/topics/trans-pacific-partnership] and end a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The TPP, which is led by the US and has been signed by its 12 member countries in the Asia-Pacific, has yet to be ratified. Many analysts believe the 12-member trade pact will fall apart without American participation, and now the focus has turned to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2047776/what-asia-pacific-trade-pacts-could-replace-tpp] (RCEP), widely dubbed China's answer to the TPP.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June 2016, Britain voted to leave the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the country splitting from the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">, May's administration will have to negotiate trade deals with individual states.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reporting by Wei Qi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With an increasingly assertive China jostling for regional leadership, much remains to be seen if Beijing will mend ties with its Asian neighbours in the new year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's territorial claims and brusque diplomacy have strained historically friendly relations with many key neighbours, forcing them to pick sides in the rivalry between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Doubts over China's peaceful intentions culminated in the landmark ruling in July[http://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea-hague-case] by the </span><span class="s3">Permanent Court of Arbitration</span><span class="s1"> in the Hague, which rejected Beijing's claims over much of the disputed South China Sea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has insisted it will not accept the international court's ruling, but the decision is still seen as too important to ignore as it set a legal benchmark for any future settlement of the long-standing disputes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Conflicting claims: an interactive package[http://multimedia.scmp.com/2016/southChinaSea/]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Manila assuming Asean chairmanship in 2017, how China continues to mend its fractured ties with rival claimants of the South China Sea - especially its Communist neighbour Vietnam - will remain a focal issue to watch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tensions with the US over the disputed waters have also been on the rise. In 2017, the </span><span class="s3">US navy</span><span class="s1"> will likely increase its freedom of navigation operations to challenge China's claims in the region. Trump has announced he will build up the </span><span class="s3">US navy</span><span class="s1">, increasing its current 272-ship fleet to 350.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also this year, the People's Liberation Army will launch its second aircraft carrier and new Type 055 guided missile destroyers. Analysts believe Beijing will likely speed up its constructions and military deployments on its South China Sea reefs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China hopes impeached South Korean President Park Geun-hye's successor - who will be elected this year - will drop the controversial Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system, it is unlikely to thaw relations with Seoul immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's dilemma in reining in the unruly North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whose nuclear ambitions has rendered him a "troublemaker on China's doorstep", will only exacerbate the uncertainty over the THAAD deployment and the fragile equilibrium in East Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reporting by Shi Jiangtao</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has put into play its big plans to lure countries across the eastern hemisphere into its orbit with its massive "One Belt, One Road[http://www.scmp.com/topics/one-belt-one-road]" summit in May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The summit, which will at least match the scale of the Hangzhou G20 meeting in September 2016, is Beijing's chance to extend its influence in the region at a time when the world is coping with uncertainty as Donald Trump takes office as the next US president.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Trump retreats, Xi Jinping moves to upgrade China's global power play[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2050741/chinas-one-belt-one-road-plan-pushing-through-global]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">James Woolsey, one of Trump's policy advisers, has previously signalled potential change in America's attitude towards the "One Belt, One Road" initiative, saying there was a consensus in Washington that the Obama administration's opposition to the China-led </span><span class="s3">Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</span><span class="s1"> - part of the belt and road plan - was a strategic mistake.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent Central Economic Work Conference, which set the tone for China's economic priorities in 2017, underscored the belt and road initiatives as one of Beijing's three key development strategies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initiative involves 65 countries, stretching through southeast, south, central and west Asia to the Middle East, Africa and eastern and central Europe.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 19th party congress, which will see the five-yearly transition of power[http://www.scmp.com/chinas-leadership-reshuffle-2017] within the Communist Party, is expected to take place around November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gathering will see more than 300 full and alternative Central Committee members elected by delegates of the party congress, as well as a new Politburo and a Standing Committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">President Xi Jinping - who was in October anointed as the party's "core" - will face a power transition bound only loosely by non-official conventions on retirement and succession.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's President Xi Jinping faces his biggest political test[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2022936/chinese-president-xi-jinping-faces-his-biggest]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It remains to be seen what Xi's new title as "core of the party" really means, as it is not an official title whose rights and jurisdiction are regulated by the party and law.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Largely free from influence of party elders - which is rare in Chinese politics - the current leadership has the flexibility to introduce change in many areas within the party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Xi seeks to further consolidate his power and keep his allies close, the size of the Politburo may change, retirement rules may be made even more vague, and the new leader-in-waiting may not appear as they have done in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reporting by Jun Mai</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year is the mid-term deadline for China's three major urban clusters - Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze and Pearl river deltas - to meet their clean air targets as stated in a 2013 State Council document.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dubbed the "10-point air clean-up action plan", the document set air quality improvement targets for the three city clusters - a specified percentage drop in PM2.5 levels - as well as a quantified goal for Beijing to lower its average concentrations of the tiny particulate pollutants to 60 micrograms per cubic metre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there appear to have been improvements in the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, the frequent bouts of smog in northern China over the past several months have raised doubts about whether the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region will meet their targets and the implications if it doesn't.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2017 is also set to be a difficult year for green NGOs, particularly those headquartered in foreign countries, as many will struggle to find a government department - either a cabinet ministry or their local agencies - to supervise their daily work, under new laws laid down by the Ministry of Public Security.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some staff at these foreign organisations have already voiced their concerns. The worst-case scenario might be an exodus of foreign NGOs who fail to find proper supervisors, but this is unlikely as it would spark a global backlash.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A more likely scenario is such groups, even those traditionally known for their aggression in pursuing their causes, would be tamed and think twice before acting on matters that risk provoking Beijing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lot has happened in 2016. In January, Taiwan's independence-leaning Tsai Ing-wen won the island's presidential election by a landslide; in July, an international court handed down a landmark ruling against Beijing's claims in the South China Sea, and in November, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton to become the United States' next leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As we usher in 2017, our team of reporters have put together a list of key China issues to watch out for in the new year.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has held growth steady at 6.7 per cent throughout the first three quarters of 2016, but it is still facing big challenges as the economy continues to slow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is trying to keep the country's gross domestic product growth above 6.5 per cent, a floor set to double its economic size by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s interest rate rise in December and two or three more expected increases in 2017 have forced China to reintroduce capital outflow restrictions to defend the yuan. It has also squeezed room for credit easing, with the government now tightening controls on liquidity as preventing financial risks moves up its agenda.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why is China so afraid of US Fed's interest rate increase?[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2054482/why-should-beijing-be-nervous-about-us-fed-just-look-what]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More proactive fiscal policy, especially infrastructure construction, will be the main tool supporting growth. In 2017, the government may also raise the fiscal deficit ratio, issue more municipal and special construction bonds, and leverage private capital inflow through public-private partnership projects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China will stay on high alert against asset bubbles, especially in property. It will likely take measures such as increasing the down payment ratio and property taxes to cool speculation in the big cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One worrying sign on the horizon is that recent property restrictions have slowed sales and may hit property investment - an old economic driver - in the first half of 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is expected to help its preferred choice for Hong Kong's next chief executive[http://www.scmp.com/topics/chief-executive-election-2017] garner as many votes as possible in the election on March 26, according to political analyst Lau Siu-kai, emeritus professor of sociology at the </span><span class="s3">Chinese University of Hong Kong</span><span class="s1">.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing would do so to avoid a repeat of the scenario in the previous election in 2012, when Leung Chun-ying won the chief executive race with a record low number of votes - 689 - from the 1,200-strong election committee, Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah and Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor would hence not both be allowed to stand for election, according to Lau, as each additional candidate meant the winner would get fewer votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive race open to all, top Beijing official for Hong Kong affairs hints[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2058173/chief-executive-race-open-all-top-beijing-official-hong-kong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Candidates' popularity mattered as well, Lau said, which meant New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Judge Woo Kwok-hing had almost no chance of landing the city's top job even if they managed to secure the 150 votes required to run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One focal point for the upcoming election is whether Beijing will adjust its hardline stance towards Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts expect Beijing's stance to remain the same even after Leung relinquishes his role as the city's leader. Other believe Beijing will soften its stance, pointing to the olive branch it has extended to prominent pan-democratic figures when it promised this month[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2050238/beijing-expected-grant-permanent-home-return-permits-current] to grant them all permanent home-return permits for the first time in decades.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-strait relations is set to be affected by a range of factors in the new year, among them US president-elect Donald Trump's China policy, Beijing's resolve to punish Taiwanese pro-independence forces and the independence-leaning ruling Democratic Progressive Party's performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even before taking office, Trump has already created huge waves in relations among Beijing, Washington and Taipei by receiving a congratulatory call[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2051416/trump-talks-taiwan-president-move-risking-blowup-china] from the self-ruled island's President Tsai Ing-wen in early December. Days later, he went on to question whether the United States should continue[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2053740/trump-questions-one-china-policy] its "one China" principle.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump's freewheeling and unorthodox style of diplomacy threatens to make Taiwan more of a victim than a beneficiary as further backlash is expected from Beijing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has shut all official communication channels[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1981525/beijing-cuts-ma-era-cross-strait-communication-channel-taiwan] with Taipei since Tsai became president in May, after she refused to acknowledge the "1992 consensus" on which cross-strait ties are based. The consensus is an understanding between Beijing and Taiwan that there is only "one China" but that each side could have its own interpretation of what constitutes "China".?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taipei says Beijing has also limited the number of mainland tourists to the island, hitting its already-struggling economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, small West African nation Sao Tome and Principe severed ties[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2056276/taiwan-losing-out-diplomatic-war-beijing-sao-tome] with Taipei in a move Tsai has described as Beijing's diplomatic suppression aimed at Taiwan. Last March, Beijing resumed relations[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/1926877/gambia-and-beijing-rekindle-ties] with Gambia, another former Taiwan ally in Africa.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan's economic outlook appears dim and its international space is also narrowing as Beijing looks set to continue its hardline stance towards the island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, if Beijing refuses to budge on cross-strait relations, we will see if Tsai will soften her stance instead and adopt a more flexible approach in dealing with the mainland.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It looks like a bumpy road ahead for Sino-US relations in 2017 after Donald Trump's inauguration as President of the United States on January 20, given his provocative remarks on China and his choice of hawkish China policy advisers so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No date has been set for bilateral visits involving either Trump or China's President Xi Jinping, but the two heads of state are bound to meet at multilateral gatherings in the coming year, such as July's G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, or the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference (</span><span class="s3">Apec</span><span class="s1">) summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How the two leaders greet and interact with each other and whether they hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of these summits will be an indicator of the health of Sino-US ties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why Trump's blunt approach will put US relations with China on surer footing[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2056841/why-trumps-blunt-approach-will-put-us-relations-china-surer]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the trade imbalance and loss of American jobs, and vowed to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. He has also threatened to impose up to 45 per cent taxes on Chinese imports and asked American firms like Apple to move their manufacturing bases back to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Trump does penalise China in trade, some observers say Beijing may retaliate by similarly cutting US imports or sanctioning US firms, thereby starting a "trade war".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incoming US president sees the "one China" principle as a bargaining chip to pressure Beijing into trade concessions, but Beijing has warned that the principle is a bottom line not open for compromise and also the basis of Sino-US relations[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2053908/no-more-basis-sino-us-ties-if-one-china-policy-breached].?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new year may see tensions across the Taiwan Strait build up further, with more American arms sales to Taipei, more controversial comments from Trump about the self-ruled island in relation to Beijing, or even meetings between American and Taiwanese leaders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such moves might up Trump's ante in negotiations with China, but could also provoke strong reactions from Beijing - even retaking the island by force in a worst-case scenario. Beijing still views Taiwan as a renegade province to be retaken by force if necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How a snub of the one-China policy almost led Beijing and US into war in the 1990s[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2054141/how-snub-one-china-policy-almost-led-beijing-and-us-war]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other buttons Trump might seek to push with Beijing upon taking office include meeting Tibet's exiled Dalai Lama, raising China's human rights record or commenting on Hong Kong's democratisation process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the two global powers hope to manage their differences and work well under the Trump administration, they will have to seek new areas for cooperation and common ground on which they can build trust.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During US President Barack Obama's administration, he and Xi both agreed on climate change and cooperated well in advancing related policies. Trump can consider working with Beijing to counter terrorism and on coming to resolutions in the Middle East peace process.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prospects for international trade have taken a hit with the victory of Donald Trump, who has vowed during his US presidential campaign to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership[http://www.scmp.com/topics/trans-pacific-partnership] and end a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The TPP, which is led by the US and has been signed by its 12 member countries in the Asia-Pacific, has yet to be ratified. Many analysts believe the 12-member trade pact will fall apart without American participation, and now the focus has turned to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2047776/what-asia-pacific-trade-pacts-could-replace-tpp] (RCEP), widely dubbed China's answer to the TPP.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other nations, including Peru and Chile in Latin America, have also said they are ready to begin talks to join the Chind-led pact. The pact is also likely to be discussed during the Apec summit in Vietnam in October.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With an increasingly assertive China jostling for regional leadership, much remains to be seen if Beijing will mend ties with its Asian neighbours in the new year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's territorial claims and brusque diplomacy have strained historically friendly relations with many key neighbours, forcing them to pick sides in the rivalry between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Doubts over China's peaceful intentions culminated in the landmark ruling in July[http://www.scmp.com/topics/south-china-sea-hague-case] by the </span><span class="s3">Permanent Court of Arbitration</span><span class="s1"> in the Hague, which rejected Beijing's claims over much of the disputed South China Sea.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has insisted it will not accept the international court's ruling, but the decision is still seen as too important to ignore as it set a legal benchmark for any future settlement of the long-standing disputes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Conflicting claims: an interactive package[http://multimedia.scmp.com/2016/southChinaSea/]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is worth noting that China has so far refrained from taking further provocative steps such as large-scale island-building activities in the contested waters. It has also improved ties with the Philippines, which initiated the arbitral ruling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Manila assuming Asean chairmanship in 2017, how China continues to mend its fractured ties with rival claimants of the South China Sea - especially its Communist neighbour Vietnam - will remain a focal issue to watch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tensions with the US over the disputed waters have also been on the rise.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China hopes impeached South Korean President Park Geun-hye's successor - who will be elected this year - will drop the controversial Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system, it is unlikely to thaw relations with Seoul immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's dilemma in reining in the unruly North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whose nuclear ambitions has rendered him a "troublemaker on China's doorstep", will only exacerbate the uncertainty over the THAAD deployment and the fragile equilibrium in East Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The summit, which will at least match the scale of the Hangzhou G20 meeting in September 2016, is Beijing's chance to extend its influence in the region at a time when the world is coping with uncertainty as Donald Trump takes office as the next US president.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">James Woolsey, one of Trump's policy advisers, has previously signalled potential change in America's attitude towards the "One Belt, One Road" initiative, saying there was a consensus in Washington that the Obama administration's opposition to the China-led </span><span class="s3">Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</span><span class="s1"> - part of the belt and road plan - was a strategic mistake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent Central Economic Work Conference, which set the tone for China's economic priorities in 2017, underscored the belt and road initiatives as one of Beijing's three key development strategies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year is the mid-term deadline for China's three major urban clusters - Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze and Pearl river deltas - to meet their clean air targets as stated in a 2013 State Council document.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dubbed the "10-point air clean-up action plan", the document set air quality improvement targets for the three city clusters - a specified percentage drop in PM2.5 levels - as well as a quantified goal for Beijing to lower its average concentrations of the tiny particulate pollutants to 60 micrograms per cubic metre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there appear to have been improvements in the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, the frequent bouts of smog in northern China over the past several months have raised doubts about whether the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region will meet their targets and the implications if it doesn't.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia's relationship with its biggest trade partner, China, has seen better days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pair haven't been seeing eye to eye since December, when then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull linked Canberra's anti-foreign interference laws to what he claimed were Chinese attempts “to influence the political process” in his country - a claim that prompted an angry Beijing to summon the Australian ambassador and marked a low point from which relations are yet to recover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just last month, Beijing's ministry of commerce accused Canberra of interfering with “normal business activities” after it barred Chinese tech giant </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> from involvement in Australia's 5G network due to unspecified national security concerns. Soon afterwards, the Beijing-linked Global Times sounded the alarm about the rise of China “hawks” in the cabinet of Turnbull's successor as prime minister, Scott Morrison, pointing to the move of minister Marise Payne - a frequent Beijing critic - from the defence to foreign affairs portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But if the relationship between Canberra and Beijing has seen better days, China's ultra rich appear to be as enamoured with Australia as ever.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia was the world's No 1 migration destination for millionaires last year, according to the 2018 Global Wealth Migration Review from </span><span class="s3">AfrAsia Bank</span><span class="s1">. More than 10,000 high-worth individuals migrated to Australia last year, mostly from China, India and the UK. And about 90 per cent of the visas Australia issued to high-worth investors - those who invest more than A$5 million (US$3.6 million) locally - were for Chinese nationals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They see beyond what is in the media,” Vera Ou-Young, the head of the Chinese Services Group at consulting giant Deloitte, told This Week in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When Stonington Mansion sold for A$52.5 million in Melbourne's leafy southeast this year, it took the title for most expensive home to ever change hands in the city.[Chinese investors] see beyond what is in the mediaVera Ou-Young, Deloitte</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The previous record had been set just months earlier when the 5,000 square metre estate at 18 St Georges Road in Toorak, Melbourne's most exclusive suburb, fetched A$40 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from their eye-watering price tags, the two sales shared another thing in common: both of the buyers were Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a common story across Australia[https://www.scmp.com/topics/australia]'s top-tier neighbourhoods. From Toorak and Canterbury in Melbourne to Darling Point and Point Piper in Sydney, wealthy Chinese rank among the country's most prolific buyers of high-end real estate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For China's growing class of ultra rich, Australia has become the go-to destination for investment, leisure and, in many cases, establishing a second home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you were to go, for example, to Monomeath Avenue today … I would say there would be 20 or 30 cars full of Chinese visitors that drive up and down pointing at and looking at all the houses,” said David Morrell, director of buyer's advocate firm Morrell and Koren, referring to one of the most exclusive residential roads in Canterbury. “Because that's where they want to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Monika Tu, who runs the Sydney-based Black Diamondz Group, a high-end real estate and concierge company, deals with a couple of dozen Chinese clients each week, accounting for up to 80 per cent of her business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What is high-end? I would say at the moment about A$5 million to about A$50 million,” she said, adding that she'd recently received inquires about a potential sale in the region of A$60 million. “That's the type of properties they are looking for.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among Chinese looking to invest and do business, Australia is widely seen as safe, stable and secure.Australia offers great security for high-worth migrants and is a safe place to invest wealth</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country ranked 8th in the 2018 </span><span class="s3">A.T. Kearney</span><span class="s1"> Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, and 14th in the </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1">'s rankings for ease of doing business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Australia offers great security for high-worth migrants and is a safe place to invest wealth,” said John Li, a partner for the Oceania China Business Group at </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Its common law tradition, stable financial system and robust institutions are very attractive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australian real estate, which has exploded in value in recent decades, is seen as an especially attractive investment. Chinese buyers invested more than A$15 billion in real estate there last year, more than twice as much as any other foreign nationality. In 2016-2017, before a major clampdown by Beijing authorities on capital outflows, Chinese investors poured A$32 billion into Australian property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither figure includes the many Chinese who have acquired Australian citizenship or permanent residency before buying into the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Australian property is certainly an attractive investment,” Li said. “The Chinese have made major investments in development sites, agriculture and in businesses more generally.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many parts of Sydney and Melbourne, average house prices have more than doubled in the past decade. With a median house price of A$1.1 million, Sydney now ranks as the most expensive property market in the world after Hong Kong, according to the Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey. Nevertheless, many wealthy Chinese consider Australian real estate to be better value than the comparably cramped properties available in cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In terms of price, I think it's still really good value in Australia, for what we have,” said Tu from Black Diamondz, who herself migrated from Shenzhen in 1988. “In terms of size, the views, environment, I think it's still very reasonable.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, business isn't the only draw for China's high-fliers. Australia's reputation for carefree living and pristine natural environments is a major lure for those seeking a better quality of life. “Really it comes back to location,” said Deloitte's Ou-Young. “A lot of the decision comes down to lifestyle choices. It's about the environment, the quality of the air.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For those with children and a global mindset, the prospect of high-quality education in an English-speaking country is another major draw, Ou-Young said. “The first generation would like to see their children be successful in Australia.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Australian government statistics, more than 170,000 Chinese students were enrolled in Australian educational institutions, making them by far the biggest contributors to the country's A$28 billion international education sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A lot of the rich people, before they come here, they might have already sent their children to Australian universities, and if their kids are in Australian universities, there's a better reason for them to come to Australia,” said Barry Li, the author of The New Chinese: How They Are Shaping Australia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the United States and Canada also draw wealthy Chinese who are attracted to the Western lifestyle, Australia has the advantage of being relatively close to China and in a similar time zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's easy for them to connect to their family and friends in China, and also the jet lag is not as bad as when you fly to Canada, which plays a key role in their decision making,” said Li, the author.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beyond the real-estate market, businesses dealing in luxury goods and services have felt the impact of this influx of cash-flush consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese consumers gravitate to everything from luxury handbags to luxury jewellery,” said Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association. “We also see a demand for Australian-produced health products, food and baby products which many Australian retailers are supplying to China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luxury retailers have wasted no time seizing on the opportunity by introducing services specifically tailored to Chinese customers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Australian retailers are selling products through various different online channels like Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] (which owns the South China Morning Post) and using Chinese payment methods to attract and retain international consumers,” Zimmerman said. “In fact, many brands have moved to having Chinese speakers in their luxury stores.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kim Do, senior industry analyst at IBISWorld Australia, told This Week in Asia Chinese consumers tended to gravitate towards iconic international brands such as </span><span class="s3">Louis Vuitton</span><span class="s1"> and Saint Laurent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You see a lot of companies realising this and targeting the international consumer, and many international brands have also realised this and have started to open up a whole bunch of new stores in Australia. I mean, five years ago, we didn't even have half of the luxury brands that we do now,” she said. “In total, Chinese tourists spent around A$10.9 billion in the Australian market in the last year. It just really shows how important they are for the Australian economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese money has also made its mark in more colourful segments of the market. In recent years, yacht brokers such as Melbourne's Premier Yachting have begun catering to Chinese customers in large numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We've seen it coming for years,” said Jim Sismanes, the company's chief executive. “They're aspirational.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beginning as a trickle about five years ago, Chinese buyers now make up a significant proportion of Premier Yachting's customer base. Many have little or no experience with sailing, according to Sismanes, but are nevertheless drawn to the image of Australia's outdoorsy lifestyle.Chinese tourists spent around A$10.9 billion in the Australian market last yearKim Do, IBISWorld Australia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They don't necessarily really ‘get' outdoors as much as Australians do, but they want to learn,” he said. “They want to understand, they want to appreciate it more.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As with exclusive handbags and garments, it's the prestigious brands that attract the most interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They are very conscious of branding. Anything Italian is very sought after,” Sismanes said. “They want to touch and feel them, check out the layout, check out how it feels to them before they make any commitment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the boats that Premiere Yachting sells typically range in price from A$100,000 to A$10 million, the company has received inquiries from Chinese buyers interested in even more extravagant vessels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We didn't make a sale, but I know there was a Queensland client we dealt with who was looking for a A$40 million-plus super yacht,” Sismanes said. “We've dealt with some incredibly wealthy people. Wealthier than any Australians we've dealt with.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the economic benefit for local businesses, the influx of wealthy Chinese to live, work and play in Australia has also generated a fair degree of suspicion and even outright hostility. Among the biggest grievances is the perception Chinese investors have priced locals out of the property market in big cities like Sydney, where the median house price has soared to nearly 13 times the median household income, according to the Demographia survey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Morrell, the buyer's advocate in Melbourne, said “Chinese whales” distort prices in exclusive neighbourhoods by paying over the odds for investment properties they would never live in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We had this situation years ago where it was out of control, where you had 19-year-old girls buying A$5 million properties at auction, and you go, ‘Something's really wrong here',” he said. “They just didn't care because they wanted the money out [of China].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If sometimes of questionable veracity, tales abound of Chinese buyers dropping cash as if money were no object. Exacerbating tensions are suspicions that some investors are able to circumvent rules for foreign buyers, such as by getting family members to buy on their behalf, as well as questions about funding sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the things we've learned in Australia over the years is that you don't gain millions or hundreds of millions of dollars really quickly honestly,” Morrell said. “You know what I mean? A lot of this is ill-gotten gains finding its way to our shores.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015-2016, the </span><span class="s3">Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre</span><span class="s1"> investigated more than A$3 billion in suspicious transactions involving Chinese investors, A$1 billion of which was related to property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While a cause of resentment, the true impact of Chinese investment on house prices is disputed, with some economic analyses showing little effect either way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sydney-based property agent Tu, meanwhile, rubbishes the suggestion that wealthy buyers would ever pay above the odds for a property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One hundred per cent of my buyers are very sophisticated businesspeople and they are very savvy on property so they know exactly what they are looking for, and how much is a reasonable price,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wealthy Chinese with political connections in Australia[https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-australia-relations] have also faced scrutiny amid a debate about foreign interference in Australia's politics and institutions. Chinese nationals and entities donated more than A$12.6 million to Australian political parties between 2000 and 2016, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of all foreign donations, according to a Melbourne Law School analysis reported by The New Daily.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Billionaire property developers Huang Xiangmo and Chau Chak Wing are among the prominent Chinese-Australian businessmen to have had the ear of Australia's two leading parties, Liberal and Labor, having donated millions to each.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Turnbull's Liberal government drew a line in the sand with the passage of new foreign interference laws, including a complete ban on political donations from overseas. The introduction of the laws, after Turnbull highlighted concerns about Chinese meddling in a speech to parliament, sent relations between Beijing and Canberra to a nadir[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2150394/chinese-more-wary-investing-australia-amid-rising] from which they are still recovering. Despite the tensions, however, most observers see the Chinese love affair with Australia continuing for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Australia places high importance on its relationship with China,” said Li, the partner at Ernest &amp; Young. “It has a large Australian-Chinese population which has strengthened cultural ties over many years. There will continue to be strong demand from wealthy Chinese to settle in Australia.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even in the property market, which saw a drop-off in Chinese investment last year as Beijing tightened capital outflow rules, there are expectations in some quarters that a resurgence is on the horizon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese real estate website Juwai.com recently reported an upswing in inquiries for Australian property since earlier this year amid suggestions Beijing may relax restrictions on outward investment. “Definitely it's going to continue,” said Tu of Black Diamondz, referring to Chinese interest in top-end Australian real estate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interest in the country as a whole seems an even surer bet. Li, the author, said Chinese would continue to choose Australia as long as it kept its door open.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It all depends on government policy,” he said. “I mean, if we go back to the policy in the 1970s - let's not welcome any Chinese in Australia - then you'll stop them, but I don't think that's going to happen. If you open the door, then of course you'll get people coming in from all directions.”■</span></p>
