<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang who controls acquisitive conglomerate Fosun Group plans to spend 4 billion yuan (US$630 million) to buy a controlling stake in dating service provider Baihe Network, charting a new course into the online matchmaking business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo, 51, has agreed with 32 shareholders to buy 869 million shares, or a 69.2 per cent stake, at 4.6 yuan apiece, according to a statement published by Baihe on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The billionaire will conduct the buyout through Ningbo-based Yuanhong Investment, a firm that is wholly owned by Guo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baihe, one of the mainland's largest dating sites, is traded on the Beijing's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, or “new third board”, an over-the-counter equity exchange slated for technology start-ups.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yuanhong aims to chase high-growth opportunities in new economy businesses related to the internet,” Guo's company said in a statement. “After the acquisition, the company expects to profit from the further growth of Baihe.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017 Baihe posted a net profit of 65 million yuan, reversing from a loss of 114 million yuan a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's services span online and offline dating, consulting and event organising, including wedding planning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, Baihe acquired and privatised Nasdaq-listed </span><span class="s3">Jiayuan.com International</span><span class="s1">, one of its major rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Compared to e-commerce and e-payment, online dating is a market that has yet to be fully tapped,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management. “The number of registered users appears to be huge and online matchmaking has the potential to grow.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baihe has 310 million registered users and 200 outlets that offer dating services.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2010, the Shanghai-based company has been on a global asset shopping spree, acquiring Portugal's largest insurance group Fidelidade, French luxury resort operator Club Med, a 9.5 per cent stake in jewellery and fashion accessories brand Folli Follie, and a minority stake in entertainment company </span><span class="s3">Cirque du Soleil</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai Tiandihui Supply Chain Management, China's largest online road transport operator, is eyeing an initial public offering after closing the latest round of financing from a clutch of yuan-denominated investment funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu Shuibo, founder and chief executive of Tiandihui, said the technology start-up would turn profitable in 2018 after four years of operations. That would be a big step towards a mainland listing as the domestic stock exchanges begin scrambling for home-grown unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's taken time for the mainland market to understand our businesses,” he said. “But the key lies in whether the IPO applicant has convincing operating data. We are making efforts to show investors our growth potential and solid performance.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui raised 500 million yuan (US$79.1 million) in a third round of financing led by CICC Jiacheng Investment Management, a subsidiary of investment bank </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, whose online platform matches lorries with cargo in more than 50 cities across the mainland, would not disclose its valuation after the financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on annual revenue of 5 billion yuan in 2017, its valuation could have reached US$1 billion, the threshold for an unlisted technology firm to become a unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If it were to make a profit this year, it would meet the earnings requirements of mainland securities regulators for an A-share listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will keep our fundamentals unchanged to chase profits,” Xu said. “More importantly, we want to expand our business scale faster in this untapped market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He did not elaborate on the time frame for an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui seeks fresh funds to expand to supply chain finance[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2104821/tiandihui-seeks-fresh-funds-expand-supply-chain-finance]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui, dubbed China's </span><span class="s3">CH Robinson</span><span class="s1"> - a US multimodal transport services provider - aims to roll out its operations in 80 mainland cities and double its revenue to 10 billion yuan in 2018, Xu added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are actively hunting for mainland unicorns as the central government encourages technology firms to raise funds on the domestic equity market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move is part of efforts to support a transition of the Chinese economy into a sustainable growth model driven by entrepreneurship and consumer spending.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui is among the few large Chinese tech firms that has publicly revealed a clear intention to list on the domestic bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, nearly all Chinese technology companies conducted IPOs in overseas markets such as Hong Kong and New York because their ownership structure and performance were not in compliance with the mainland's listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Foxconn Industrial internet, a unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer, received a fast-track approval to launch a 27 billion yuan IPO on the Shanghai exchange just five weeks after it filed its application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui handled transactions worth 118 billion yuan in 2017, nearly double the amount a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Road transport makes up 60 per cent of China's 11 trillion yuan logistics market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The staggering size of the logistics sector is seen as a drag on the country's manufacturing industries because they end up footing a huge bill for transport costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aside from expanding its network and investing in new facilities, Xu said the proceeds from the fundraising would also be used to reinforce Tiandihui's supply-chain finance segment. Tiandihui offers loans to logistics firms operating on its platform to help them upgrade their fleet of trucks and enhance efficiency.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size has the unusual luxury of a rest day today to consider whether he should pursue an international start with Real Specialist or keep those ambitions for later on after the five-year-old returned in triumph yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With 133 pounds on board and certainly no dream run through the </span><span class="s3">Panasonic</span><span class="s1"> Cup (1,400m), Real Specialist and Douglas Whyte looked destined for the also-ran basket even at the 300m mark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But just as his rivals looked to have him covered, Real Specialist lifted himself over the final stages to grab New Vision and Keen Marie right where it counts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With 100m to go, I wasn't going to get there, but he sticks his neck out and really wants to win," Whyte said later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Earlier in his career, he got to that point and he wanted to go left or right and be wayward. He got away with it in the lower grades but he's had to change his attitude to make transition to being a big horse, and he's done that now. If he gets into these big races coming up, he won't be there just making up the numbers. If the big names make a mistake he'll be there to zap them up."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Size's first Hong Kong season, he announced his arrival by producing Electronic Unicorn in the same race to win in stunning fashion before taking the Chevalier Cup next as his stepping stone into the internationals, but that option isn't open to him with Real Specialist as his rating now will render him ineligible for that race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That leaves Size's options as backing up in the Jockey Club Mile next weekend to roll out his credentials for the Longines Hong Kong Mile next month, or not running again until international day, December 9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Well, I've got a day to think about it since we raced on Saturday not Sunday," Size said. "I'll see how he is at home and if I think he can back up, he will.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If I think the best thing for him is to have a few weeks before he runs again, then that's what he'll do. His rating isn't enough to command an automatic call-up for the international race, so there's a Class One on international day that he can run in if the Jockey Club doesn't select him."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Real Specialist only scrambled home, both Size and Whyte highlighted the win was far better than the on-paper result might indicate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The short margins at the top end of the race and the time are probably not a good indication of the performance," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Real Specialist has often been able to park close to the pace in his races and Whyte said he didn't lack any gate speed yesterday, but he opted out of trying to use it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He had speed but I could see the ones inside me weren't going to let up, so I dropped off and let him drift back rather than having to do too much for too long with that weight," the jockey explained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was the best thing I could have done, as it let him find some momentum back there, but I got put even further back at the 800m when Kyara was being untractable and came out in front of me."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The win took Real Specialist's impressive record to seven wins, three seconds from 13 starts, with his only failures when tried at staying distances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the winner rightly took all the plaudits, the John Moore-trained pair of Kyara and Silver Grecian ran shockers, although the vets found substantial blood in the trachea of Kyara, which would explain his flop.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed live streaming game platform Douyu was named the fastest growing technology company in Asia Pacific, according to global accounting and consultancy firm Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wuhan Douyu Network Technology Co, operator of douyu.com, a website similar to Amazon's Twitch, has seen its revenue surge 707.8 times over the past three years as live-streaming and mobile gaming continues to grow in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The revenue surge comes as the three-year-old start-up achieved unicorn status in June after investments from backers including Tencent and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> helped vault its valuation to over US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies that are focused on providing China's millennials with inexpensive entertainment options, such as gaming and live streaming, or those focused on e-commerce and fintech, are continuing to succeed,” William Chou, Deloitte China's managing partner in technology, media and telecommunications, said in a statement on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market penetration of digital technology in China continues to grow, with those born after 1990 showing a much higher propensity to consume online content due to greater acceptance of digital payments and credit facilities, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Live-broadcasting has taken off in China, becoming one of the hottest sectors in China's rapidly evolving internet environment, with nearly 400 million people regularly watching live broadcasts via mobile devices, according to iResearch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new, low-cost pastime was estimated to have generated US$3 billion in revenue last year, up 180 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu, whose name literally translates as “fighting fish”, is one of the many companies that built a business around gamers broadcasting their online matches and sharing their strategies with fellow gamers, before expanding to other kinds of live streaming content such as cooking lessons, cosmetic tips and outdoor sports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have worked very hard since we began in 2014 and have now started earning profits as a result,” Chen Shaojie, founder and chief executive of Douyu TV, said in a statement. Chen declined to elaborate when contacted for follow up questions by phone.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Wuhan-based start-up is competing with over 200 competitors including Panda TV, a live-streaming game site backed by Wang Sicong, the son of China's second-richest tycoon Wang Jianlin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Asia Pacific region continues to be at the forefront of revolutionary digital change,” said Toshifumi Kusunoki, a Deloitte leader.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New York city headquartered co-working space operator WeWork will focus its China business in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing in the near future while leveraging the connections and networks of its local partners as a means to fend off aggressive domestic competitors, its co-founder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The copycats are interesting because some of them branded themselves as ‘WeWork of China', which helped establish us before we were there,” Miguel McKelvey, co-founder of the “unicorn” valued at around US$17 billion last year, said during the opening ceremony of its space in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay district on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“More people and businesses are moving in this direction...we are making our products the best,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to the two locations it currently owns in Hong Kong, WeWork is slated to open its first Beijing location in May, and another two in the Chinese capital in the near future. It also plans to bolster its two existing locations in Shanghai with three more work spaces in co-operation with its Chinese investment partners, which include property developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Zhao, chairman of mainland private equity fund Hony Capital, one of WeWork's key investors, said sentiments for investing in the US were recovering as concerns eased after US President Donald Trump talked to China's leadership. Zhao added that he believes cross-border investment from China to the US would increase rather than be dampened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> moves 300 staff into WeWork hot-desking site in Causeway Bay</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A consortium led by </span><span class="s3">Hony Capital</span><span class="s1">, joined by its parent company </span><span class="s3">Legend Holdings</span><span class="s1">, Shanghai's Jinjiang hotel group, and two property player Oceanwide Group and Greenland Holdings, invested a total of US$690 million in WeWork last March, securing a boardroom seat after the investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The founders realised very quickly that their company should be both global and local. Now through our connections, Hony has brought in some very powerful local partners,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Group</span><span class="s1"> is weighing an investment of well over US$1 billion in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported in late January. However, WeWork executives didn't confirm the report during Thursday's media interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Right now we don't have anything to announce [about fund raising], but it's something we've always been considering. As for going public, we are certainly preparing for it internally, but we have no time frame,” said McKelvey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ole Ruch, managing director of Asia and Australia for WeWork, said occupancy rates for their space was very high, reaching 90 to 95 per cent in mature markets. He added that the company would open new space in India soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's </span><span class="s3">Legend Holdings</span><span class="s1"> embraces ‘shared economy' with investment in WeWork</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, competition from home grown co-working spaces in China is heating up, with rivals basing their business models on to WeWork's approach, while competing with lower prices and integration with local start-up incubators like Kr Space.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early November Prometheus Capital, a private equity fund founded by Wang Sicong, the son of China's richest man Wang Jianlin and backed by </span><span class="s3">IDG Capital Partners</span><span class="s1">, announced it had invested a combined 200 million yuan (US$30 million) in Kr Space, a co-working space spinoff from technology media and entrepreneur service company 36Kr.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">36Kr is backed by </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which is part of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, the owner of South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sharing economy business is forecasted by PwC to be worth US$335 billion by 2025, up from around US$15 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past several years Hong Kong has been trying to reinvent itself as a hi-tech hub, looking to turn start-ups into the next </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">. But with the focus on technology, other entrepreneurs say they are being neglected, even though they feel they are just as important to the city's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After his recycling business collapsed four years ago, Wouter van Marle established a hydroponics start-up, which allows Hongkongers to use their balcony or rooftop to grow vegetables such as choi sum and bok choi, as well as herbs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Van Marle self-funded his business - also known as bootstrapping - but found it difficult to tap sources for financing and marketing advice, which were more widely available for tech start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“From the point of view of investors, I don't really understand it. Because the chance of making money with [my business] is much better than the chance of making the next big thing on the internet,” van Marle, owner of City Hydroponics, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Of course, they will never make billions on this, but the chance of making it profitable is much greater.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Van Marle added that there were “many more of these relatively small ideas” being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the government's investment promotion arm, </span><span class="s3">InvestHK</span><span class="s1">, there are about 2,000 start-ups in Hong Kong - mostly tech-related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the internet boom, Hong Kong was mainly a trading and finance hub for the region. But the internet revolution has investors and the government clamouring to find the next technology unicorn - a company valued at more than US$1 billion - leaving traditional or low-tech businesses to fend for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecka Lundin, a full-time product developer for a major international clothing retailer in Hong Kong, moonlights as a skin care start-up entrepreneur. She said she hoped for subsidised spaces for low-tech retailers to help generate interest in businesses like hers - an advantage given to tech start-ups in areas such as the Science Park in Sha Tin and Cyberport in Pok Fu Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would love to have a workspace that's also retail all in one,” Lundin, the owner of Swedish's, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lundin said she got the feeling “nobody cared” about businesses like hers and she would like to have support similar to tech start-ups so she could concentrate on her business full time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chinese University associate professor of economics Terence Chong Tai-leung argued that the government could not support every industry and would probably like to sunset certain low-tech sectors in favour of hi-tech industries, hoping to hit the jackpot with another Apple or GoGoVan - an app-based transport and logistics service and one of Hong Kong's successful unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other than subsidised work spaces, the government also provides for tech start-ups an incubation programme which provides up to HK$330,000 in financial assistance, subsidised legal fees, subsidised training, trade fair or exhibition services, advertising subsidises and networking and mentorship opportunities. Most of these are not available to low-tech start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now, however, two local entrepreneurs have decided to take matters into their own hands and establish their own start-up that helps low-tech small businesses and home-based entrepreneurs get noticed by customers and potential investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anasua Chatterjee and Sai Sudha Chandradekaran started Hidden Truffles in 2014 after seeing a wide range of start-ups with customers confined to family, friends and peers, without the knowledge or money to break out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Somehow we felt all of them were stunted in their growth and were only kept within friend circles ... they did not have a way to grow professionally,” Chandradekaran said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most home-based start-ups received an opportunity to meet their customers in person at various pop-up bazaars held around the city several times a year, Chatterjee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But going beyond bazaars was where start-ups would succeed, the pair believed. So the duo started “pitch nights” for entrepreneurs to get start-up owners out of their comfort zones and thinking outside of their usual customer base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They've stopped thinking beyond B2C [business to customer], and pitch night allows them to strike a professional relationship with somebody unknown and coach them about doing business in this day and age,” Chandradekaran said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After three years, their company has a listing of about 250 ultra-small businesses which can be discovered by customers, investors and firms. They have also seen audiences grow for their pitch nights, which Chatterjee and Chandradekaran said proved there was still interest in low-tech, home-based, small businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Two judges from one of our pitch nights asked us to connect them with two of the businesses because they wanted to follow them and see if there was potential to invest in them,” Chandradekaran said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UrWork, a major shared work space provider in China, has taken its rivalry with US giant WeWork into Southeast Asia by financially backing an Indonesian start-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based UrWork took part in an early round of funding that raised US$3 million for ReWork, which will use the cash to bankroll its expansion from Jakarta to the island of Bali. The fundraising was led by ATM Capital and Indonesia's Convergence Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With 88 locations in 25 Chinese cities, UrWork is one of China biggest players in the co-working field. A recent round of financing valued the company at US$1.5 billion. It is a direct rival of the American giant, WeWork, which recently made its own foray into Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As Chinese co-working companies look overseas and move to cater to medium-to-high end tenants, such changes will inevitably pose challenges to WeWork," said Yu Kexin, an analyst iResearch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As it launches eight new locations at home, UrWork aims to move into 32 cities worldwide, setting up 160 shared workspaces over the next three years, according to a statement posted on the company's website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision came around the same time that WeWork announced its plan to acquire Singapore-based SpaceMob as part of a US$500 million investment in Southeast Asia and South Korea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UrWork, with its continued fundraising and overseas ambitions, has been seen as a threat to the US unicorn as it doubles down in the world's second largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The co-working sector has taken off in China over the past three years, thanks partly to the country's efforts to promote entrepreneurship. According to iResearch, the market was worth 4.29 billion yuan at the end of 2016. Rent generates 80 per cent of income for space providers and added incubation services and government subsidies another 10 per cent each.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The co-working sector is still in its infancy in Southeast Asia. Global partnerships will enable companies to learn from mature operating models and provide extensive services to tenants," said Yu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, China's largest online medical services app, has priced its closely watched initial public offering at the top end of its price range. It hopes to raise HK$8.77 billion (US$1.12 billion) after its flotation, Hong Kong's biggest in 2018, was overbought by more than 650 times by retail investors, making it the city's most sought-after main IPO since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor, formally known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, has priced its IPO at HK$54.8 a share, which is the top end of the HK$50.8 to HK$54.8 price range, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flotation, the first by a unicorn in Hong Kong this year and also the biggest in value, has attracted retail investor demand that is 653 times more than the number of shares on offer, exceeding China Literature's retail oversubscription rate of 625 times, the most among main IPOs in the past nine years. In July 2009, Chinese property developer BBMG's share offering was oversubscribed by 782 times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The international placing tranche was also “massively” oversubscribed, sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor plans to sell 160.094 million shares in total, and had initially set aside 6.5 per cent for retail investors. But the huge oversubscription for its public offering has triggered a so-called clawback clause, which will enable underwriters to reallocate shares to retail investors from institutional investors, and increase the retail tranche to 25 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese coffee chain operator Luckin Coffee has raised US$200 million in its latest funding round, doubling the valuation of the </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> challenger in just five months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The B round of fundraising was led by its existing investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1">, Joy Capital and Centrium Capital, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest investment follows a July A round when Luckin raised US$200 million at a valuation of US$1 billion, bringing the Xiamen-based start-up unicorn status in the six months since a soft launch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin has expanded to over 1,700 stores in 21 major cities across China and claims "thorough” coverage of downtown Beijing and Shanghai, where there's basically a store within a five-minute walk for everyone, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will continue to increase capital investment in product research, technology innovation and business development, and continue to optimise our product and user experience,” Qian Zhiya, Luckin chief executive said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up promises an average customer in major cities that they need only wait about 18 minutes after placing a delivery order through their phone to receive their coffee, Qian said in a July interview. Such orders would be fulfilled by "takeaway kitchens” where coffee is prepared exclusively for on-demand service.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The man who battled Travis Kalanick to a standstill and forced </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> to pull out of China is unperturbed by talk of a challenger to his ride-hailing throne.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you want war, you will get war,” Cheng Wei, the co-founder and chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, the world's biggest ride-hailing company, said in a recent interview with Caijing Magazine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng, 34, was quoting 12th-century Mongolian warrior-ruler Genghis Khan, whose empire spanned Asia to the Adriatic Sea, in response to a question about competition from </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, which has advertised its plans to expand into the ride-hailing industry in several Chinese cities with offers of steep discounts to consumers and rebates to drivers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi, which counts hi-tech giants Apple, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings among its biggest shareholders[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1944553/apple-invests-us1b-didi-chinas-uber], is itself born from a truce between two rival ride-hailing companies[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1713463/leading-taxi-apps-kuaidi-and-didi-us6b-merger-counter-ubers] that had engaged in a ruinous price war, which at one point went as far as giving consumers free rides to win market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After that merger, the combined entity took on Uber, which pulled out of China in 2016[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1997821/uber-sells-chinese-business-didi-chuxing] in return for a minority stake in Didi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Didi has withstood the fiercest competition in history, from Kuaidi to Uber. We have PK'ed countless rivals,” said Cheng, using a local slang for duelling. “</span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> may not be the weakest, but it may not be the strongest either.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng's comments were confirmed by a representative of Didi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Headquartered in Beijing, Didi last week secured more than US$4 billion in a new equity funding round led by Japanese conglomerate </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Group Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That lifted the Chinese ride-sharing company's valuation to about US$56 billion and boosted its cash reserves to US$12 billion[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2125203/chinas-didi-chuxing-raises-us4bn-new-funding-taking-total-more], according to a person familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi, which serves more than 400 million users in China, said that investment will support its business expansion initiatives, including in artificial intelligence and the development of new energy vehicle service networks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping had raised US$4 billion in its latest funding round in October, giving it a US$30 billion valuation that places it behind Uber, </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, and ahead of </span><span class="s3">SpaceX</span><span class="s1">, the space travel start-up founded by Elon Musk, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights.</span></p>

Last year, New York-listed Alibaba reached a deal to sell its stake in Meituan-Dianping[http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/1906522/china-internet-giant-alibaba-eyes-global-retail-expansion-quarterly] for a reported US$900 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping signalled its ambitions to expand into ride-hailing on Thursday, when it unveiled a new booking icon on its mobile app, with a pledge to start services in Beijing as soon as it collects 200,000 sign-up clicks from future customers and drivers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It doesn't matter which platform I have to work with, as long as it puts more money in my pockets,” said Li, 40, a driver for Didi in Beijing who only gave his family name. “Right now, Didi takes 20 per cent of the ride fare as commission.

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In light of what were otherwise quite routine events at the Jockey Club last week, the seventh race on Sunday gave us pause to wonder about a particular direction that is being taken.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unless you happen to be in the ballot for a racehorse ownership permit of any kind, the results of said ballot are enough to make the eyes glaze over and might be prescribed as a cure for insomnia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But underneath the prosaic announcements of the successful applicants last week, there were some numbers that had us scratching our heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the June 2008 ballots, the Jockey Club announced names of the members who had secured permits for 80 Private Purchase (PP) horses, those with previous careers somewhere else; 200 Private Private Purchase Griffin (PPG) horses, that were unraced anywhere; and 25 Subscription Griffins. The SGs are no more but also were unraced horses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A year later, and again the following year, the spill was 100 PPs and 220 PPGs. Yawn. You're right, but stay with us. Then someone's bright idea changed the formula and not for the better.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, there were permits for 220 PPGs again but 120 PPs, which rose to 130 the following year and now to 150. And the list for PPG permits shrank to 180 last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why is this wrong? Why would anyone care? Because any increase in PP permits leads to an increase in uncompetitive runners, a step backwards for any racing jurisdiction, let alone one that prizes its place at the leading edge. It also runs contrary to certain smart owners' initiatives the club introduced at the turn of the century.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the seventh race on Sunday was a lovely example of what happens when PPs flood the market: of 14 runners, seven were 100-1 or longer - some much longer - and all of the centurions were PPs which, for reasons of acclimatisation, fitness, unsuitability or modest talent, were not going to play a part.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ironically, the winner was also a PP, Able Friend, but a well-prepped, talented animal from a stable capable of producing competitive debutant PPs. They are a rarity and only a handful win each season. This term, seven PPs have won their Hong Kong debut and that is a boom year. More often the score is two or three.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So we have a regular scenario that sees PPs go out at 100-1, not only on debut but for the first four or five times we see them, until they drop from Class Three to Class Four in many cases and start to be competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ninth Galaxy had eight turns as a triple-figure punching bag and there are many that run at 100-1 three, four and five times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During this season, we have seen 761 runners at 100-1 or better, so how many were PPs? Remove the horses which have been here for more than one season and you're left with the "P" and "N" horses and then remove any international visitors which might have been at those odds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 196 "P" branded horses left - this season's imports - which ran around at 100-1 in any start, 135 were PPs. From the 322 "N" horses to run at 100-1, the percentage is lower, at 203 PPs, but still significantly higher than the horses which arrive unraced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously raced horses are an important part of the scene. Many of our best have been PPs, though PPGs like Fairy King Prawn, Electronic Unicorn, Silent Witness and Ambitious Dragon etc weren't too shabby, either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unraced horses lacking education, health or talent are still a better deal for owners - they find their levels faster, and are usually cheaper to buy than PPs with the same issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then you have replacement permits. Just over a decade ago, the club made some adjustments to rules allowing owners to replace horses and they've been tweaking them ever since. But no matter how you slice them, replacing a PPG is more satisfactory than having to replace an overpriced, under-talented PP with another of the same.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Raced horses with talent, that somebody actually wants to sell for a reasonable price? Trickier to find than Edward Snowden.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By increasing the number of PP permits, the Jockey Club is actively encouraging more uncompetitive runners in races, which should be the opposite of its intentions. With turnover rising by double digits, it's difficult to suggest to anyone at Sports Road that something is bad for turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a way, it's right - as long as Hong Kong is bordering China and money of whatever colour keeps leaking in ever larger droplets across the border, we are not expecting turnover to drop again. Ever. But that doesn't mean a policy should be acceptable simply because its obvious and negative effects will be masked at the bottom line.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaohongshu, a popular social commerce site in China, raised US$300 million in its Series D round of funding from investors including </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, valuing the five-year-old start-up at over US$3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mobile app, which means “little red book” in Chinese, operates like a combination of </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1"> where users share photos and videos, write posts and tag items in their pictures that link to e-commerce listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba led the latest round of investment into the Shanghai-based start-up, which counts GSP Ventures, Tencent Investment, GGV Capital, Genesis Capital, Tiantu Capital, </span><span class="s3">Zhen Fund</span><span class="s1"> and K11's Adrian Cheng among its investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new funds would be “used to support talent acquisition, machine learning infrastructure and user growth,” the company said in a statement Friday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is adopting what has been described as a social+ business model, where different industries such as education, news and e-commerce are anchored by a social pillar that drives user engagement and growth. The social interactions among consumers play a part in encouraging others to also purchase items. The country's social commerce market will top US$150 billion with 24 million merchants selling on such platforms by 2020, according to e-commerce marketing firm Advangent. That compares with the estimated US$1.7 trillion total e-commerce market in China by 2020, according to </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Xiaohongshu, many users post photographs of themselves wearing make-up or showing off new skincare products, and interested buyers can browse the site to see what others are saying about a specific make-up product they wish to buy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A series of successful recent initial public offerings suggests Hong Kong's stock exchange may be turning into a listing hub for technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the transformation is something of a mixed blessing as two large international companies with a traditional business focus announce their departure from the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new trend shows the exchange's efforts to get more "new economy" companies to list their shares here is bearing fruit, while past attempts to attract and retain international companies have proved less successful.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange, traditionally a hub for financial and property companies, has seen several technology IPOs in recent weeks selling like hot cakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though Hong Kong is one of the largest IPO destinations in the world in terms of funds raised, it has until now not been popular with technology companies. It ranked only 12th worldwide for tech IPOs in the first eight months of this year, below the likes of New York, Switzerland, Singapore and South Korea, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, funds raised through tech IPOs in the same period surged threefold to US$18.87 billion from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO market has been dominated by financial firms, which made up 59 per cent of funds raised between January and September, while technology companies accounted for a mere 0.8 per cent, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent spate of tech IPOs hopefully represents a turnaround. The latest data from the stock exchange shows IT shares had become the third largest category in the Hong Kong stock market as of the end of September, after property and finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO trend is likely to continue, particularly after the regulator and the government supported </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in launching a pilot scheme next year to allow "unicorn" internet companies - those with a valuation exceeding US$1 billion - with dual class shares structure to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The red hot fintech IPO rally started with online-only insurer </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which launched the biggest listing by a financial technology firm in Hong Kong's history in September, locking in about HK$200 billion (US$25.64 billion) of capital in an offering that was nearly 400 times oversubscribed ahead of its debut, making it the most popular flotation of the year at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Literature listing expected to leave ZhongAn's IPO in its shadow[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2117813/china-literature-listing-expected-leave-zhongans-ipo-its-shadow]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its record however was quickly and easily surpassed by China Literature, the mainland's largest online publishing and e-book site, which has just completed its IPO this week and is expected to be oversubscribed by more than 600 times and lock up about HK$520 billion (US$66.66 billion). That would make it the second highest on record after </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction Corporation</span><span class="s1">'s IPO locked up capital of HK$540 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US-based gaming equipment maker Razer, which is backed by </span><span class="s3">Intel Corp</span><span class="s1"> and Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, also started its IPO in Hong Kong on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a natural trend for investors to shift their focus to the technology and new economies as mainland companies such as Tencent or Alibaba are not just coming out with good innovations, but also delivering profits," said Clement Chan Kam-wing, managing director of accounting firm BDO.Hong Kong investors are very smart. They put their money on whatever sector or companies promise them a good returnClement Chan Kam-wing, managing director, BDO</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong investors are very smart. They put their money on whatever sector or companies promise them a good return. The trend of fintech and other technology companies listing in Hong Kong is set to continue in the coming year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These technology IPOs are very popular with Hong Kong investors. Many investors want to take a quick profit after seeing the strong share-price rally of the technology companies in both Hong Kong and overseas," said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn's share price shot up at least 60 per cent from its debut at HK$59.7 on September 28 to HK$90.8 on October 9 before dropping back to HK$77.3 at Thursday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides retail investors wanting to make a quick profit from the tech IPO bonanza , large institutional investors are also chasing these stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The primary listings of technology-related companies in Hong Kong benefit from the level of local investor participation as well as international investor interest. Investors are seeking good liquidity and coverage by analysts," said Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of insurance company AIA Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the lock-up of so much capital in the tech IPOs and other technology-related stocks has dried up the liquidity in traditional stocks, prompting two international firms to opt for exit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week's sizzling IPO bonanza was counterbalanced somewhat by news of the delistings of the two companies, which had faced a cold response from local investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American luxury brand Coach announced on Wednesday that it would withdraw from its secondary listing in Hong Kong because of thin trading. That came a day after </span><span class="s3">Glencore</span><span class="s1">, the Swiss commodity trading and mining firm, said it would delist on January 31 next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Coach and </span><span class="s3">Glencore</span><span class="s1"> launched their secondary listings in the city in 2011, after the Hong Kong stock exchange ramped up its marketing campaign to promote the value of an expanded equity presence to multinational companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their departure suggests their listings had not helped HKEX to become more international. Hong Kong stock market is still very much dominated by mainland companies, which account for 38 per cent of the main board's market capitalisation and 47 per cent of its turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the top 10 most traded stocks in Hong Kong in the third quarter, eight were Chinese firms, with only </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and HKEX itself as the exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX proposes latest ‘Connect' system - this time to lure more foreign listings and then link them with Chinese shareholders[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2112258/hkex-proposes-latest-connect-system-time-lure-more-foreign]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, chairman of Christfund Securities and a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the current tech fever may be just a short-term phenomenon. He believes investors would still be interested in buying the shares of good quality international companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's very important for HKEX to fight for the many infrastructure projects of the Belt and Road Initiative to list here. And it's likely that if HKEX could successfully fight for </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list here, it would be the world's largest IPO and would encourage investors to trade these international stocks listing in Hong Kong," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia is considering listing about 5 per cent of the state oil giant next year, which would raise US$100 billion if the firm was valued at about US$2 trillion as hoped.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will soon be possible to rent a flat with a facial scan and pay automatically by locking the door when you leave, thanks to blockchain-enabled "smart contracts", according to </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> is developing applications that, when combined with biometric recognition, will make the home rental experience "more convenient and efficient", said Geoff Jiang, the company's vice president and head of Ant Technologies Lab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is building a smart contract platform which can be applied to industries such as the industrial, finance and leasing markets," Jiang told the South China Morning Post on the sideline of the Alibaba Computing Conference in Hangzhou, where the company is based.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A "smart contract" is a self-executing agreement stored on blockchain, where the executions are triggered automatically when certain terms have been met. It is believed to be one of the most promising applications for business-related blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ant Financial remains ‘optimistic' on blockchain technology despite PBOC's cryptocurrencies crackdown[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2112481/ant-financial-remains-optimistic-blockchain-technology-despite-pbocs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of Alibaba's initial projects included working with the Hangzhou Realty Administrative Bureau in developing a leasing regulation and service platform that came online last month, where property agents, tenants and landlords register using facial scan and all transactions are recorded to prevent fraud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The interest in blockchain by the real estate industry coincides with the central government's effort to boost the residential leasing market to counter endless price rises of homes in the country's first and second-tier cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cities including Beijing, Chengdu and Hefei have announced plans to increase land supply for rental housing and encourage the setting up of more property leasing firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jiang said the key to success lies in finding "killer applications" that are both practical and suitable for smart contracts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> has confidence in blockchain. With distributed ledgers, internet of things and data sharing, a lot of [technology] revolutions await Alibaba," he told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Blockchain, together with artificial intelligence, security, internet of things and cloud computing - collectively known as BASIC - are the five technologies Ant said it will focus on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such optimism is despite China's ban one of blockchain's most popular applications - cryptocurrencies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If big data and cloud computing in the era of fintech 1.0 are like the motor vehicle engines, BASIC in fintech 2.0 is the capability to manufacture cars or even autonomous driving mobiles," said Hu Xi, vice president and chief architect of Ant Financial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, the financial unicorn has applied blockchain technology to its charity platforms and for tracking the source of products to increase supply chain transparency, Jiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He cited cooperation with Moutai, one of China's most luxury liquor brands, as an example of how blockchain helps eliminate counterfeits from the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Known as the technology behind bitcoin, blockchain is a secure transaction ledger database shared by all parties participating in an established and distributed network. It irrevocably records and stores every transaction or exchange of data that occurs in the network, essentially eliminating the need for a central authority.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stars have aligned for Unique Awesome in a Class Four on Sunday at Sha Tin, where the Almond Lee-trained three-year-old stands out as banker in the opening leg of the Triple Trio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A step up to a mile at his third career start looks perfect for the youngster after a strong closing effort and barrier one on the C+3 course should allow for a perfect trailing run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After a debut run where he scooted home for fifth, Unique Awesome found himself right in the market two starts back and on face value was disappointing. He raced back in the field, Alvin Ng Ka-chun had trouble settling the gelding, and he was one-paced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when he relaxed better last start, Unique Awesome caught the eye at the end of 1,400m to indicate a step up in distance was in order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He maps to get a nice trail behind obvious leader Heart Wood, who will be first-up for a new stable off a three-month break and with 10-pound claimer Jack Wong Ho-nam aboard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heart Wood has needed a light weight in Class Four to win previously, and requires all the favours in the way of a nice draw or soft lead in order to do it, but he could get that here. Heart Wood will be carrying 118 pounds and he could easily get the lead without much pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though Malayan Pearl can sit handy and has front-running apprentice Dicky Lui Cheuk-yin on top, he hasn't been able to show the speed to press forward over 1,600m, the lower end of his distance scale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From gate one, Unique Awesome can roll along behind and either settle in the box seat or three back the fence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It could be a "Unique" quinella in the race, with Unique Joyful (Keith Yeung Ming-lun) the obvious danger after a strong last start display. The Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained four-year-old has put together a string of consistent efforts and is another who looks ready for the step up to a mile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last start, Unique Joyful sat three wide with no cover and up near the speed, yet still stuck on gamely to be beaten just a half length. The trouble for him here is another wide gate on the C+3.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next best is Chris So Wai-yin's Asia Rising (Douglas Whyte), whose runs at 1,600m and beyond have been solid and has run on for third in his two starts down in Class Four. He needs some tempo to show his best, but should be right in the contest anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a race that lacks depth, but include Unicorn (Zac Purton) despite his wide gate, and consider Imperial Gallantry (Howard Cheng Yue-tin).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the second leg, a Class Four over 1,200m, take a chance on a horse that has been disappointing since his early season win, Benno Yung Tin-pang's four-year-old Sensation (Purton).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sensation trialled well since his last start and drops into a lovely draw, gate two, from where Purton should get the run of the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take Sensation as banker ahead of Spitfire (Nash Rawiller), who gets a great chance at a second career win from barrier one after a solid effort behind impressive newcomer Bayonet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ten Flames (Derek Leung Ka-chun) and Thors Bolt (Whyte) look the best of the closers and go in despite being hampered by tricky draws.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Size sends first-starter Coup D'Etat (Joao Moreira) straight to the races after a solitary trial in New Zealand and two local efforts, neither of them impressive, where he was asked to chase. He still should be included out of respect for the stable, and while another debutant This Is Gladiator (Cheng) might not be in the market, he should be kept safe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the final leg, take Gold Dragon (Neil Callan) as banker, with the Richard Gibson-trained three-year-old coming back to 1,400m, where he looks more comfortable with the help of a soft draw.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It looked like Bear-Pop (Moreira) had his birthday last start when he got all the favours and even though he drew out here, this is a weak contest and he has to go in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also take Never Better (Purton), Elegance Klammer (Olivier Doleuze) and Golden Partners (Damian Lane).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As an analyst covering tech start-ups in China, Zhao Ziming has seen some really wacky ideas cross his desk. Even so, he was surprised by his cousin, who was preparing to launch a start-up to share rolls of toilet paper.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My cousin said he always cannot find toilet paper in the restrooms in most office buildings in China, so he is going to start an app to share toilet paper, at one yuan for a roll,” said Zhao, who works for Beijing-based consultancy Cyzone. “I told him that was a really stupid idea and brought him to some restrooms in Beijing to prove that his idea can't work, that there's no demand for sharing toilet paper.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has seen an entrepreneurial fever sweep the population, lured by tales of exponential riches made seemingly overnight and news about a new class of billionaires minted by the internet boom. Venture capital funds were awash with money and chased marginal ideas, leading to a boom-and-bust cycle that is now still playing out particularly in the so-called sharing economy, which is a term for owners renting out something they are not using.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reminiscent of the dotcom boom in the late 1990s when any company that added a .com suffix</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">guaranteed investor interest, many start-ups in China have raised millions of dollars by shopping around concepts tied to sharing. Except that start-up founders and the venture capital money funding them have moved on from cars and homes, represented by the likes of Uber and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, to areas like rental of bicycles, power banks and even life-size companion dolls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flood of money, though, appears to be slowing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China-based companies raised a total of US$8.8 billion in the quarter ended September, or about half of the US$16.8 billion raised in the same period two years earlier, according to data compiled by Dow Jones VentureSource.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unicorn fever seizes China as start-ups and investors seek the next big thing[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2125953/unicorn-fever-seizes-china-start-ups-and-investors-seek-next-big]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest proportion of that money - 42 per cent - was invested in consumer services, a broad category that covers everything from bicycle sharing and second-hand car trading to online learning. Fintech, shorthand for computer programs that support banking and financial services, was second with about 32 per cent of the investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other reports put the amount of funds raised by sharing start-ups at about US$24.4 billion in the first seven months of this year, about enough to fund two new US aircraft carriers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the most prominent sectors attracting institutional investment is bicycle sharing, which has been popularly referred to as one of China's four modern-day “inventions” together with high-speed railway, mobile payments and online shopping. The reference itself is a nod to ancient China's role in the making of paper, gunpowder, printing and the compass.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bluegogo, once China's third-largest bike-sharing start-up, abruptly closed down in December, leaving scores of users with unreturned deposits. Wukong Bicycle ceased operations after just five months, followed swiftly by 3Vbike, which was mainly offering its services in third-tier cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At its peak, there were about 100 companies offering similar dockless short-term bicycle rental services in China. The market was so crowded - not to mention pedestrian walkways outside subway stations and major tourist attractions - with multi-hued bicycles that those late to the game ran out of colours to paint their bikes. These days, only three companies, Mobike, Ofo and Hellobike, are seen to have enough scale and financial muscle to potentially survive another price war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The casualties aren't restricted to bicycle sharing. Beijing-based car-sharing companies Ezzy and Youyou, as well as umbrella-sharing company Huoli Modeng and sleeping-capsule sharing enterprise Xiangshui Space all announced they had ceased business operations this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These start-ups typically failed because they had run out of funds before being able to find a sustainable profitmaking model. Many times, these companies had to effectively give out their products and services for next to nothing in the hopes of building a sizeable user base that they could then either charge a fee (once the other competitors all died off) or sell the data to some third-party user to mine for marketing and sales leads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese entrepreneurs are very keen on expanding market share to gain leading position,” said Kerry Lai, the founder of a three-year education start-up in Shenzhen who is looking for a business partner to help with the company's expansion. “It can easily lead to insolvency or bankruptcy if revenue cannot keep up with the aggressive expansion.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the era of fast-and-easy money largely over, venture capital investors like Andrew Yanyan are becoming more selective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I have become humbler and more cautious in selecting investment projects and entrepreneurs over time because of my experience of failure,” said Yanyan, who has been in the venture capital industry for over 20 years and is founding managing partner of </span><span class="s3">SAIF Partners</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separating good ideas from bad is easy compared with identifying a good start-up founder, which is arguably a more important determinant of the company's eventual success, he said. “But I myself get confused about what makes a good start-up founder.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Zhao at Cyzone, the current fever for all things artificial intelligence, spurred on by high-profile backing by the central government, is a harbinger of a bust to come.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The golden time of attracting investments only by ideas has passed,” said Zhao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now people and capital are shifting their attention to artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the coming two years, closures will increase in these sectors.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six years ago, fewer than a dozen big venture capital firms were based in Chengdu, said Wu Zhong, general manager of Yinke Venture Capital. And most of the ones that were there, operated without a functioning office or staff. Whenever an industry seminar came to the city, organisers called contacts on their list but no one was ever in town.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Organisers don't have that problem now, as venture capitalists arrive in a steady stream, renting prime office space and executive residences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yinke Venture Capital has witnessed the breakneck growth of Chengdu's private equity industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2009 by the Chengdu government and </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> with 1.5 billion yuan ­(HK$1.74 billion) in capital, the fund of funds has teamed up with national players to foster promising companies in emerging industries. By March, its funds were managing a combined 6 billion yuan in assets.We are bullish on Chengdu's economy, and there are enough promising start-upsWu Zhong, Yinke Venture Capital, general manager</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But unlike some fund of funds backed at the local government level, Yinke doesn't require its funds to invest a certain proportion in home-grown firms, Wu said. While Yinke had such requirements for its general partners during the early years, they found this "non-market-oriented" approach didn't work, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the project is really good, general partners certainly will invest. If not, how can you demand them to invest?" Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the fund of funds does require their investments to actively engage in local fairs and funds should be locally incorporated, with local offices and resident staff.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are bullish on Chengdu's economy, and there are enough promising start-ups. The question is whether they can effectively spot them. This is why we require them to operate locally," Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chengdu Detong-YInke Capital Fund, launched with Shanghai-based Detong Capital, outperformed other eight other parallel yuan-denominated funds under Detong's management, with annualised growth of more than 50 per cent since it was founded in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">General manager Li Nong said his fund would like to remain rooted in Chengdu as his team was bullish about the opportunities, citing the defence, high-end manufacturing and agri-tech sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm committed to spotting ‘original' unicorn companies. If the company is in Beijing and Shanghai, it will immediately be pursued by numerous funds. But here we get the opportunity," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As one of the earliest venture capitalists to arrive in the city, Li has seen the industry grow from infancy. He said the city had better potential to become a private equity centre before could turn into true financial centre. "Private equity is special because despite its small scale, it's extremely active and can stimulate the whole system," Li said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The John Size-trained Sight Lover has not been the kindest to punters, but Triple Trio players will look to him as a banker again in the opening leg at Happy Valley tomorrow night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sight Lover has been well in the betting at most of his 10 starts and has delivered only once but he got along well with Weichong Marwing last start, finishing second to Oyster over the Valley 1,650m, and the pair up again from a good draw in what looks an open event to start off the fresh TT pool with a $2 million prize on offer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another with serious claims looks to be maiden three-year-old Riyadh (Olivier Doleuze), who has been runner-up at both his starts for Michael Chang Chun-wai over the this course and he has his hoof right on the till. Both times he gave away a start to the race leader who went on to win and he should be hitting the line strongly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the placings, punters should certainly include track-specialist Ottimo (Alvin Ng Ka-chun), thereabouts in his three attempts since a drop back to Class Four, Silver Dragon, who should benefit from the removal of blinkers after running along a touch too freely in the lead last time, consistent Ambitious Treasure and a rejuvenated Easy Ahead (Ben So Tik-hung). It is several seasons since Easy Ahead's only win, leading all the way over this course, but he is showing signs that he is ready to go in again and should lead this field from the pole barrier. Two solid runs at the Valley were followed by a last-start seventh running on late over 1,200m at Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle leg offers a solid double banker in three-year-old Bundle Of Joy (Brett Prebble), despite an awkward draw, and another lightly raced runner, Beauty Sparkle (Matthew Chadwick).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The winner of two of his three starts, Bundle Of Joy looks destined for much higher in the ratings and his tactical versatility looks an important factor in this race with plenty of speed. It won't surprise if he is ridden off the pace rather than leading as he was when he won last start from Beauty Sparkle over this course.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beauty Sparkle gets a nice weight turnaround on Bundle Of Joy for that last meeting and he has drawn the coveted barrier one. Although a year older than Bundle Of Joy, Beauty Sparkle is also one with some upside after only six starts and he is close to a win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is a long list of place chances to consider, with Croesus (Tommy Berry), Mr Ginger (Zac Purton), Cour Valant, Diamond Elegance and Formula Won all capable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final leg looks a tricky one, but banker seekers could do worse than settle on Supreme Essence (Doleuze). The Michael Chang-trained gelding has raced into some form over sprint courses with a third to Impeccable and fifth to Sea The Pearls but goes to a more suitable 1,650m this time. That's the kind of distance over which he was a three-time winner in France so we should see the best of Supreme Essence now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be hard to leave out the likes of Flying Unicorn (Purton) and Intellectualstride (Gerald Mosse), who are racing well over the trip, and Happy Champion's debut at the extended Valley mile when finishing fifth after being squeezed out early was sufficient to convince Prebble to stick with him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The honest eight-year-old My Home Town gets the benefit of Dicky Lui Cheuk-yin's 10-pound claim and looks a likely leader in the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The eight-year-old's latest effort was sound when fourth to Galaxy Prancer after playing front runner and he looks a compulsory inclusion as well from barrier two.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Playing a pair of well-drawn fancies as a double banker in the final leg of tomorrow' nights Triple Trio at Happy Valley can deliver punters a share of a jackpot-boosted dividend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Barrier draws are critical when the rail is in the "C+3" position, and starting positions of Spirit Soaring and Freak Zone - drawn four and five respectively in a Class Three over the extended mile - can help them figure in the finish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The TT has been hard to crack in recent weeks, and with more than HK$7 million carrying over into this week's pool, a pay out of HK$13 million is expected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Spirit Soaring (Tim Clark) and Freak Zone (Zac Purton) come in off narrow defeats against in-form or progressive opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many European imports, John Moore's Spirit Soaring has taken a long time to acclimitise - taking 11 starts to run a place and battling some lameness issues along the way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two juvenile wins and three lengths sixth at Ascot in the Jersey Stakes gave the former Clive Brittain-trained charge a starting mark of 86. He had dropped to the brink of Class Four - a mark of 61 - when the gelding showed some spark last start with his light weight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The extended mile is where his previous career-best effort locally was, and in a short head second to Forgive And Forget showed an ability to take up a midfield spot and a nice turn for foot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clark replaces Eddie Lai Wai-ming, with the gelding now allotted 117 pounds after a three-pound hike for the bold last-start effort.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caspar Fownes' New Zealand-bred Freak Zone has also been troubled by leg issues, a left front tendon injury sidelined him earlier this term after an impressive first-up run over 1,400m at Sha Tin. Freak Zone got into a real dogfight with Victory Master and never gave in, the winner going on to win again in Class Two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fownes has switched to visors - essentially blinkers with a small slit cut in the cowl - after the four-year-old had worn conventional shades in his first two runs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He heads to the Valley for the first time but had a trial at the city track under Zac Purton and did everything right.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another horse with tendon problems, but who seems like he could be about to turn a corner - the Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained Cheer (Howard Cheng Yue-tin) - a six-year-old whose rating once budged triple figures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At one stage, Cheer won four races and was placed five times in the space of 13 starts, taking his rating to 99. Then persistent front tendon issues plagued the gelding, and eventually surgery was required.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His rating had dropped to where he has found himself in Class Four - and Cheer clearly appreciated the drop in grade when he was a solid fourth. The key is the switch back to the Valley, where the horse has been unplaced just twice in 11 starts and has notched all four of his victories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The options are limited after that, but three horses widely drawn but worth some consideration are New Greenfield (Brett Prebble),last-start winner Noble De Best (Umberto Rispoli) and My Home Town (Richard Fourie).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drawn one, Able Magic (Derek Leung Ka-chun) is the obvious stand out in the first leg, a Class Four over 1,650m, from Always Something (Olivier Doleuze), Forever Ahead (Brett Prebble) and Goldmen Y Y (Lai).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the middle pin, Fownes has utlilised Alvin Ng Ka-chun's seven-pound allowance on Dream Builder, who has drawn five in a Class Three 1,200m sprint. Take him as a banker from Gold Ball (Doleuze), Rainbow Fighter (Weichong Marwing) and Perfect Finish (Keith Yeung Ming-lun).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese students returning home with overseas educational qualifications are still likely to be paid better in the short and long run, than those educated at home, although fresh graduates arriving back on home soil have become more realistic in what salary levels to expect in their first jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wide-ranging new latest research, polling 100,000 Chinese grads, suggests Chinese students armed with a foreign degree are this year being paid 17.2 per cent more than those graduating from a home university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carried out by BossZhipin, a Beijing-based big-data recruitment firm, the study showed 26.3 per cent of fresh graduates from overseas universities are being paid over 10,000 yuan (US$1,500) and 2.3 per cent more than 20,000 yuan per month in their first jobs in China - which is double, and triple the level of the average domestic graduates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But interestingly, the advantages of an overseas educational grow even more pronounced in the longer run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After eight years in work back home, 43.2 per cent of the returnees can now expect to be paid over 20,000 yuan a month, 30 percentage points more than domestically counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Newly returned students, on average, pitch for expected monthly salaries of 8,315 yuan, but in reality they are actually being paid 7,306 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of more ambitious returnees looking for upward of 15,000 yuan per month has lowered their expectations, with 11.6 per cent this year, from 13.8 per cent in 2016, while those who are happy to be paid below 8,000 yuan have increased from last year's 41.2 per cent to 45.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Beijing, maybe unsurprisingly, are the biggest magnets for returning graduates, accounting for 28.8 per cent and 24.9 per cent, respectively. Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Guangzhou ranked 3-5, attracting 8.6 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Official Ministry of Education data shows 544,500 Chinese left to study abroad last year, of which 498,200 were self-funded. But the rate of returnees this year has soared to 80 per cent, compared with just 30 per cent a decade ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher earning potential and more promising career prospects have helped internet technology-related sectors overtake financial and professional areas - such as lawyers and accountants - to become the most desired choices for returnees looking to settle at home, despite half of them being armed with business or finance degrees, the study also showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year, 16.2 per cent of returnees chose to work for internet firms, up 3.1 per cent from 13.1 in 2014. Business and financial sectors attracted 14.9 per cent compared with over 18 per cent three year ago, followed by education and training (13.4 per cent), media's (8.7 per cent) and culture and entertainment (6.4 per cent).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet giants and so called unicorn start-ups (those with US$1 billion+ valuations) were shown to be the best payers and students also considered them as offering the best career prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consulting, legal, accounting and auditing jobs still offer handsome pay packages, and were identified as being ideal to build future connections, although more are losing out now to hi-tech recruiters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although internet companies are most popular among returners, just 42 per cent of those who accepted job offers from them actually had computer science- and natural science-related majors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business and financial majors were the most common, accounting for over a half of returning students over the past two years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores Technology Group, a Hong Kong-listed contractor-turned-blockchain investor, plans to raise HK$100 million (US$12.7 million) via a digital token fund to finance a yen-backed cryptocurrency project.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores Technology's pivot to blockchain investment is the result of an acquisition of SHIS by a company controlled by Yongjie Yao in May and its subsequent back door listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao is also a founding partner of the 10 billion yuan (US$1.45 billion) Hangzhou Grandshores Fund backed by the Hangzhou government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other backers of the fund include Li Xiaolai, the bitcoin tycoon of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Grandshores Technology chairman said the company would tap qualified investors outside China to raise funds denominated in tether, a US-dollar backed stablecoin and list it on a cryptocurrency exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset such as gold or hard currencies like the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said Grandshores was seeking to fund start-ups and cryptocurrency projects globally as he believes some blockchain unicorn-hopefuls were on track to disrupt the traditional financial system and break monopolies currently enjoyed by tech and internet giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Blockchain will become the mainstream technology in the next three to five years,” said Yao, who is also a part-time lecturer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. “We are entering the next stage of blockchain evolution, a stage which is akin to when computer operating system was transiting from MS-DOS [disk operating system] to MS-Windows.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the yen stablecoin project, Yao said the founding partners of the Hangzhou Grandshores fund, are currently working with a mid-tier Japanese bank, whose name he refused to divulge, in creating a stablecoin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said he sees demand for a yen-linked stablecoin, and is hopeful of launching the token by the end of this year or early 2019 and the next anchor currencies Grandshores will explore are the Hong Kong dollar and Australian dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe cryptocurrency traders and exchanges will be potential takers of these stablecoin,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many cryptocurrency exchanges already trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and EOS against tether. Grandshores Technology's yen stablecoin could provide an alternative that can be traded on these exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao was also an early investor in Canaan, the world's second largest maker of bitcoin mining rigs which is seeking to raise US$1 billion and list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has invested 107 million yuan in Canaan since 2015 through his own blockchain venture fund, and is expecting returns “to the tune of several hundred times”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, the founding partners of Hangzhou Grandshores fund, together with some of its affiliated funds under Grandshores Technology, have invested 500 million yuan globally in blockchain and cryptocurrency projects outside China. These include Zcash, an open-source cryptocurrency that offers selective transparency of transactions; blockchain start-up GX Chain and blockchain-based social media network ONO.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ucommune chairman Mao Daqing has predicted no more new players will enter China's crowded co-working office space industry as the pace of consolidation picks up in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao said this will remain the story moving forward, following a series of mergers initiated last year by Ucommune, the country's largest co-working space provider, with domestic rivals Woo Space, Wedo Coworking and New Space.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The merger of different platforms sped up our [growth], which was the most exciting thing for me in the past year,” he said on Wednesday as the company, formerly known as UrWork, marked its third anniversary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2015, Beijing-based Ucommune now has more than 100,000 individual members and 6,000 corporate clients at 160 locations across 36 cities, including Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as New York and Los Angeles in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's co-working space unicorn holds firm at home amid push into to Europe[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2120393/chinas-co-working-space-unicorn-holds-firm-home-amid-push-europe]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's expansion strategy has put it on a collision course against larger US co-working space operator WeWork, which agreed to merge last week with Chinese rival Naked Hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeWork, counted among the world's most valuable start-ups at about US$20 billion, will pay about US$400 million for the three-year-old Chinese business, according to Bloomberg. The deal adds co-working spaces in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, as well as Vietnam, Australia and Britain to the portfolio of the New York-based firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies such as Ucommune and WeWork are flourishing because a rising number of young workers are opting for flexible working hours and a more relaxed working environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising number of technology start-ups bolstered by Beijing's ambitious goal of turning the mainland into a global innovation powerhouse has created a strong demand for flexible offices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Co-working spaces taking China by storm[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125778/co-working-spaces-taking-china-storm]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A survey by global property services company JLL found that 81 per cent of white-collar respondents in Shanghai now accept working in flexible offices, compared with 24 per cent at the end of 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An explosive growth of co-working offices can be expected as the authorities ramp up support for start-ups by offering them fast track listing approvals, and more young entrepreneurs set up their own shops,” said Daniel Yao, research director with JLL.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global market for co-working office space is forecast to reach 30,432 locations and 5.1 million members by 2022, according to co-working conference organiser GCUC. Those numbers are up from 14,411 co-working space locations and 1.7 million members last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GCUC estimated the Asia-Pacific to continue growing rapidly over the next five years, with China becoming the world's largest co-working office space market by 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao, the 49-year-old founder of Ucommune, said the sweeping consolidation in China's co-working office space market will see only the biggest companies survive as new investments in the industry decline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the country's sharing economy saw plenty of investors and start-ups “trying to get a slice of the pie”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that frenzy dies down as soon as a couple of billion-dollar start-ups, known as unicorns, emerge in the market, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Comparing the co-working space business with the once red-hot bike sharing market, Mao said “one is a moron if someone says he wants to do bike-sharing now”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bike-sharing has been among the most prominent sectors that have seen weaker players drop out as funding dried up. The consolidation in bike-sharing followed that in ride-hailing, which saw fierce competition between rival platforms before </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> emerged to take on and eventually acquire the China operations of </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After kicking out Uber, Didi now faces a new challenge. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, the world's largest on-demand delivery platform that is known as the Chinese </span><span class="s3">Yelp</span><span class="s1">, is expected to launch a national expansion of its ride-hailing business after debuting the service in Nanjing city in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's sharing economy raised a record 216 billion yuan (US$34.4 billion) last year, an increase by more than a quarter compared from a year earlier, according to a report by the State Information Centre, which predicted that competition among platform companies will intensify and drive the number of mergers and acquisitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mergers and acquisitions in this business is quite normal,” Mao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the country's co-working space market, Ucommune's string of mergers has helped lift its valuation to 11 billion yuan (US$1.7 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has raised US$525 million in total venture capital funding, more than the rest of China's co-working space providers combined, according to venture capital research service CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York start-up WeWork just made a big play for China's co-working crown[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2141411/new-york-start-just-made-big-play-chinas-co-working-crown]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is backed by a group of large multinational and Chinese investors, including </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Zhen Fund</span><span class="s1">, Noah Wealth Management and Sinovation Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, if history is any guide, one cannot rule out further developmentsfor co-working space providers amid efforts by Baidu, Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, the parent of South China Morning Post, to become more involved in the sharing economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese bike-sharing start-up Ofo last month secured US$866 million in a new round of financing led by Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao, a former vice-president at Chinese residential property developer Vanke and grandson of Beijing's Great Hall of the People architect Mao Ziyao, said the co-working space market has been relatively outside the sphere of activity of the Chinese internet triumvirate known as BAT.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are not like the internet companies who must choose to side with one of these giants,” Mao said. “But we collaborate with BAT.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> is expanding its shopping features, allowing merchants to add shopping tags to their social media posts as the US photo and video-sharing giant takes a leaf out of the book of Chinese social commerce networks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The shopping tags feature will be available for merchants in </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> Stories, a popular feature where users can post videos and pictures that are valid for only 24 hours. According to </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">, over 300 million users view the Stories feature daily and a recent survey showed that they do so to “stay in-the-know with brands they're interested in, get an insider view of products they like and find out about new products that are relevant to them.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shopping tags that link directly to a product listing are not new: China's social commerce companies have been using them since 2015, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> tried something similar in the same year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's boom in online shopping and its penchant for social networks has seen companies such as Pinduoduo and Xiaohongshu tap the so-called Social+ business model where they offer e-commerce services underpinned primarily by a social community. Pinduoduo, which offers group buying discounts in the manner of </span><span class="s3">Groupon</span><span class="s1"> in the US, has more 300 million paying customers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaohongshu, which has its roots in a social community for Chinese users to discuss and share overseas and cross-border shopping tips, first implemented shoppable tags around 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai-based social commerce firm, with 80 million users, is popular as a platform to discuss cosmetics and skincare products, with users able to share photos of their latest purchases on their feed, tagging the name and brand of each item before linking it to a product listing page within Xiaohongshu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s Tmall marketplace experimented with putting shoppable tags on its “Fun” page within the site's mobile app, where users could show off their purchases and add tags to the photos.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gates to a medieval castle open and in comes a majestic queen riding a silver unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Juxtaposing the archaic castle is a ghostly hologram of Lady Gaga's face floating high above - welcoming you to a world where anything goes, where Mother Monster herself can pop out of a gigantic womb or be pressed into a meat grinder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga launches into her top hit Born This Way in a jewel-encrusted black gown with outstretched wings like a goddess from hell. The crowd goes wild with their iconic Little Monster claw raised up high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you find the painful screams, the gory meat dresses and the almost-naked dancers' homoerotic caresses a little hard to stomach, then find the exit, because Lady Gaga couldn't care less.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga splays her legs - and freezes - before a male dancer's face, leaving the audience to finish the thought with their cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All the breathless dancing and techno beats may have blanketed the au naturale essence of Lady Gaga's songwriting talent, and a highlight is when she rides a motorbike onto a stage that serves as her keyboard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She sings the misty-eyed Hair on her keyboard and bellows, urging the audience to be "as free as [their] hair".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But "classics" such as Bad Romance and Just Dance drew the loudest cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga's costumes - as spectacular as her music - are worth noting. In one playful moment she wears a dress that extends into a keyboard, placing a hand between her legs while pretending to grace the keys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between the arches of the medieval castle - the backdrop of the stage - hang large chunks of meat. It's Lady Gaga's new take on her famous meat dress as she performs Americano - and ends with her disappearing into a meat grinder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing conservatives who accuse her of promoting homosexuality, she says "you can be whoever you want to be - gay, straight, bisexual or transexual... And don't worry about [the protesters]. In order for change to happen, there has to be a storm - and this is the storm."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Today is about a secular experience of music," she declares. But before you take her word for it, Lady Gaga flips religious convention on its head and declares "Jesus is the new black" and points to a male dancer as the "black Jesus".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The concert was no doubt not a disappointment to the fans who arrived early at the AsiaWorld-Arena wearing platinum wigs, black leather vests, sky-high stilettos and fake blood.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They were hoping to claim spots in the Monster Pit - the special zone reserved for a handful of those holding HK$1,580 and HK$1,280 standing tickets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Lee Pat-shuen, 19, was first in line, arriving at 4am on Monday wearing 13-centimetre stilettos and a blonde pigtail wig.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His dedication earned him the thrill of signing a gigantic Monster Pit key, a privilege given to the first in line at each of the 110 gigs on Gaga's "Born This Way Ball" world tour. He was also invited backstage to meet the star after the gig.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By adding a range of financial and payment services from cinema ticket purchases to booking taxis on to their core messaging and gaming businesses, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">' </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> Pay and Ant Financial Services' Alipay have become the primary platforms of choice and are winning the competition against traditional banks to engage Chinese retail customers in financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong is still lagging behind in developing digital banking. Control over the predominant platforms in Hong Kong is still undecided, which is the key to owning the valuable customer relationship, said McSheaffrey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What is crucial in Hong Kong is it has still not been decided who will run the platform [of digital banking], which is still up for grabs. It is likely to be a combination of technology companies and banks together that will drive this ecosystem,” said McSheaffrey.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company that is going to be truly successful will be the one that owns the customer relationship and the interaction with the users allowing it to generate data and tailor products and services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means the company will be able to select other providers to provide services on its platform to give what the customer wants, and thereby capturing the most value while other companies merely are “service providers”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trust, personalisation and convenience are also factors that are needed to enhance customer experience, said McSheaffrey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whichever company that can control the customer relationship, that is where the real value is going to be,” McSheaffrey said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology has already enabled traditional banks to provide basic online and mobile banking services but new entrants should provide an impetus to traditional banks to collaborate with innovative start-ups that would change how many retail customers and small medium enterprises consume financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab joins fintech race to become Hong Kong's first licensed virtual bank [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2144899/welab-joins-fintech-race-become-hong-kongs-first-licensed]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many fintech companies have developed innovative technology that can enhance the overall customer experience, lower the costs of financial products and facilitate the granting of loans to consumers who otherwise do not have the credit history to obtain finance from traditional banks. This could encourage traditional banks to further develop their own platforms and customer-focused digital services, thereby raising the bar across the entire banking sector in Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab, Hong Kong's home-grown fintech unicorn, told the Post in May it would be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the HKMA after the guidelines were issued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> has teamed up with internet giant Tencent and online travel provider Ctrip, and is seeking more tech partners to develop its virtual banking services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Opportunities to banks are likely to arise from the ongoing development of the Greater Bay Area in southern China to transform the region into a global technology hub.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ambitious Dragon was beaten but not bowed in the Jockey Club Mile yesterday for the second year running and trainer Tony Millard quickly called for a rematch in the Longines Hong Kong Mile next month with his conqueror Glorious Days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wearing blinkers for the first time, the John Size-trained Glorious Days (Douglas Whyte) was smashed in betting from 6.5 to 2.8, then travelled like a new horse in running and beat Ambitious Dragon at his own game in the sprint down the straight to win by a clear margin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He has always promised to do that, it was just a matter of whether he delivered," said Size. "I'd been thinking about blinkers for him last season when he first got into Group company, when he started to looked as though he was intimidated or not focusing when he was beaten a couple of times. But I decided not to because he was racing well despite it."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But after a sound defeat at the hands of the Horse of the Year first-up this season, Size said the Jockey Club Mile would see Glorious Days in blinkers in an effort to narrow the gap between them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, the gap vanished, then turned right around yesterday, with Whyte highlighting how switched on Glorious Days had been in the straight as he dashed away from Ambitious Dragon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I always thought, in the last four runs, that he would need blinkers. It has been frustrating in a sense riding him because, in the early days, his brilliance won him races and he could afford to make mistakes," Whyte said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the last few have been frustrating because he's been coming through, giving me this amazing feeling and then hitting a flat spot, like he's lost concentration, and it's gone. Today he just travelled so sweetly, and when I've pressed the button, he's taken up the slack and taken up the gap that I wanted and just been a man about it. Full credit to John - he has thought about the blinkers for a while too but he said you can put them on the wrong day and the horse overraces and then you've lost him. He decided today was the important day, the right day."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size now has a serious favourite in the Hong Kong Mile for the fourth time, with Electronic Unicorn (twice) and Armada all finishing second in the past, and he admitted after this win that he wasn't expecting any further improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think you could ask for more than his effort today," he said. "It's a pretty big run going into a big race, which is always a discomfort, but he's got three weeks to get over it. If he just repeated that run, that would be enough. To ask him to step up again would be too much."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Millard had been toying with a choice between the Hong Kong Cup and Mile next month, but declared his hand rather than any extreme disappointment yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Second run in, that's what I feared - a flat run like last year. First-up, he ran 1 minute 33s and change with 133 pounds on his back and this time they've run 1 minute 34 seconds and he's been beaten," Millard pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"You've just got to take it. This time there five pounds between them, and next time there's no pounds. I've spoken to his owner, and it looks like we'll go the Mile. We've just got to move forward and I'd rather have a flat run now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jockey Zac Purton echoed the trainer's view and said Ambitious Dragon was a different horse second-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Last time he towed me into the race, then dashed away. Today he towed me up but as soon as I went for him, he was flat," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think there's a great deal between him and Glorious Days, though, and the five pounds that made a difference today could make a difference next time."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, the former Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has joined online lender WeLab as a senior adviser, the second top minister to join the budding fintech sector in as many months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining WeLab is Chan's first major private sector commitment since he left the government in July last year after serving in the post for 10 years. He has since returned to academics as an adjunct professor of finance with the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 61, has taken a path similar to former financial secretary, John Tsang Chun-wah, who was defeated last year in his bid to become the city's chief executive, and in June joined fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific as vice-chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan declined to reveal his salary for his role in WeLab, which he took up on July 6 but was only made public on July 16.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said this was not a full-time job and that he could advise other fintech companies as well while continuing to teach at the university. At WeLab he will only help with setting out strategy and will not be involved in the day to day operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I taught at the university in the first part of my career. Then I joined the government for 10 years as a minister. Now I think it is right time for me to open a new chapter in my career in fintech,”Chan said WeLab's office in Sheung Wan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I always promoted fintech when I was in the government. During the past 12 months at the university, my focus has also been on financial technology and start-ups. By joining WeLab, it gives me a chance to put academic theory about financial technology into use,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's decision to join WeLab has a lot to do with his faith in co-founder Simon Loong.The home-grown unicorn - which has a valuation of US$1 billion - will be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), Loong told the Post in an exclusive interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority is now accepting application from new players to set up virtual banks which purely offer services online without any physical branches.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The online lender last week filed an application to list on the main board of Hong Kong stock exchange.Brokers speculate it may raise US$500 million, although the company has not made any comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a start-up which uses big data and other new technology to approve and handle loan approval. It is full of young staff below 30 years old. I like to work with young colleagues to try something new,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said fintech development in Hong Kong has taken huge strides since the HKMA brought in a range of measures last September to promote banks to use new technology to cut costs and enhance their services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chan was in government, e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014 opted for listing in New York instead of Hong Kong as the city at the time did not accept dual-class shareholding companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April implemented massive listing reforms to attract dual-class shareholding companies and biotech tech firms without revenue to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We did all want Alibaba to list here but our regulations would not let that happen. There was no regret as we had to follow the regulations at the time. We do hope after the listing reform of HKEX, we can now attract many of the unicorns to list in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's successful listing marks the beginning of an era for multiple class shareholding companies to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, said it was a positive move for a former minister to join the fintech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fintech is a hot topic in town and has a lot of room for development,” Cheung said. “It will be good to have these experienced government officials join the fintech industry as this will help forge closer ties between the public and private sector and promote Hong Kong as a smart city.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American Restaurant, a Hong Kong institution for more than half a century, has closed. Hoardings went up a few months ago for “renovations”, a telltale sign that it might not reopen, and now there is signage that another restaurant is replacing it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a go-to place for big groups of diners, mostly expatriates keen to indulge in large plates of food washed down with bottles of Tsingtao beer. The waiters, who looked jaded and would have been in their sixties, were accustomed to inebriated and boisterous guests and to taking orders in English for the restaurant's northern Chinese fare.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the American Restaurant's most memorable dishes were the Peking duck - which arrived at your table already sliced and accompanied by the giant steamed pancakes in which to wrap the meat. The duck was on the oily side, but as the health-conscious didn't walk into this place it didn't matter. The minced duck meat was served in a stir-fry wrapped in large cabbage leaves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another was the Mongolian beef pockets, in which dry, shredded (and oily) beef was stuffed into hollow sesame pockets. The beef had a simmering spiciness that slowly fired up the taste buds the more you ate. It was so spicy, and yet so addictive.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most dramatic dish had to be the sizzling Sichuan prawns. When it arrived at the table, the waiter would pour the sauce on top, causing a giant waft of cough-inducing steam. Diners held their napkins over their faces and chests to protect their respiratory tracts and clothes from the sweet and sour sauce flying off the iron-hot platter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once the sizzling died down, the prawns tasted fantastic - large and crunchy, and with a pronounced garlic taste.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even when credit cards became popular, the restaurant didn't accept them, so diners had to bring wads of cash to pay the bill at the end of the evening; some had to run to the nearest ATM, which was blocks away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American Restaurant was often recommended in tourist guides to Hong Kong and travel features about the city, and a visit by Prince Andrew, Duke of York when his </span><span class="s3">Royal Navy</span><span class="s1"> ship was on a port visit in the 1980s may have garnered it some extra publicity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The restaurant was founded in 1950 by Chung Shu-luen, who apparently enjoyed sitting at a table in the corner observing the hustle and bustle of the place. American Restaurant's original location was in Wan Chai Road, near where the Cathay Theatre used to stand. Chung called it American Peking because of the American naval presence, and in Chinese it was called “Mee Lei King”, which sounds a bit like “American”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the building the restaurant was in was scheduled for demolition, Chung moved it to the western end of Lockhart Road, where it remained until its closure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two-storey establishment, with its kitsch decor, never changed much even as the rest of Wan Chai did, which is probably why American Restaurant eventually had to go, after 68 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will be sorely missed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Danny Shum Chap-shing's Hei Hei Posh drops back to his best trip at Happy Valley tomorrow night and can kick-off the Triple Trio in style as a sound banker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hei Hei Posh is a winner over 1,800m at both turf tracks, but it was his brave runner-up effort over 2,200m last start that adds some further confidence in a Class Four Handicap.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tim Clark, who rides again from gate five, was one-off facing the breeze when leader Kensworth Kid slowed to a near-walk down the back, the Australian forced to stride forward with 600m to go. Not surprisingly, Clark found himself in front a long way from home, and it was only a heads-up ride by Tye Angland on Super Strike that saw him nabbed late.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is probably a weaker field. The John Size-trained All Bountiful (Douglas Whyte) has been a hard one for punters to figure out - he heads to the city track for the first time and is stepping up to 1,800 for the first time, too. Both moves create some attraction; he is a strong-enough looking individual, and his speed could make him versatile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take your pick of the rest in a race with a long tail, but Telecom Supremo (Howard Cheng Yue-tin), Glory Of India (Angland) and Goldmen Y Y (Alex Lai Hoi-wing) look logical-enough selections.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle pin is an open race, where Dennis Yip Chor-hong's well-drawn One Of A Kind (Whyte) is a great chance of breaking through at his first try over 1,650m.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From gate three, Whyte can stalk a speed which will depend on whether Gerald Mosse on Real Dragon comes across from gate 10 to challenge last-start winner Home With Glory (Howard Cheng Yue-tin).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One Of A Kind didn't get the clearest run last start and endured a bumping duel late with winner Able Magic - a horse he meets four pounds better off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Able Magic (Zac Purton) also goes in, as does Home With Glory - a recent stable transfer who seemingly has plenty of rating points of improvement left in him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consider double-banking Home With Glory and One Of A Kind - for affordability purposes - as this is a race with a lot of strong place chances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Danzulu (Umberto Rispoli), Magnanimous (Andreas Suborics) and Sugar Pegasus (Derek Leung Ka-chun) all deserve some consideration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final leg contains a clear standout as a banker - Kick Serve (Purton), who has drawn two and handles himself well at this track in this grade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Michael Chang Chun-wai-trained six-year-old has been placed at his only two runs this term, and faces a race without depth. Kick Serve is no world beater, but he can be placed in different spots in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That could be crucial in a race with apparent speed that could drop off sharply if the nominal frontrunners sort themselves into an order early. Purton can sit as far forward, or back, as the pace dictates from that gate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gamekeepers (Whyte) has hit a wall since striking Class Three company, and barrier nine is tough, but a place is possible here. Caspar Fownes' pair Ride On The Fire (Clark) and Jumbo Gold (Vincent Ho Chak-yiu) are the next in - but it drops off sharply from there.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Foxconn Industrial Internet</span><span class="s1"> is quickly losing favour among investors only a month after its stellar debut on China's stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The affiliate of </span><span class="s3">Hon Hai Precision Industry</span><span class="s1">, known for assembling iPhones and iPads, is now among the worst-performing initial public offerings in the mainland this year, with its shares down 33 per cent from its peak in June. Its descent was swift, even as analysts had touted the company a unicorn of China's manufacturing industry, and the regulators fast-tracked the approval process for the flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These privileges were not enough to convince investors like Hengsheng Asset Management, which said the stock was more overvalued than its main customer Apple, or </span><span class="s3">Midea Group</span><span class="s1">, a comparable industry giant that is also making its foray into smart manufacturing. Foxconn Industrial's ambition to turn itself into a smart manufacturer that offers businesses from cloud computing service to precision gadgets and industry robots also had a long way to go, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foxconn unit soars by maximum 44pc in Shanghai trading debut, giving it a US$61b value[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2149856/foxconn-unit-soars-maximum-44pc-shanghai-trading-debut-giving]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We simply view the company as a traditional assembler that has low profit margins and its plan to develop smart manufacturing is still in the storytelling stage,” said Dai Ming, a Hengsheng Asset fund manager in Shanghai. “And the size of the company is already pretty big, and it's impossible for the market to give it a valuation premium like smaller growth companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foxconn Industrial is now valued at 339.4 billion yuan (US$51.1 billion) after raising 27.1 billion yuan in the mainland's biggest IPO sale in three years. Its market capitalisation is 50 times as big as the average size of the 729 companies on the ChiNext board for growth stocks. Its shares added 1.6 per cent to 17.23 yuan at the close in Shanghai on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foxconn unit gets green light to start fundraising for US$4.3 billion IPO, China's biggest in three years[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2146000/foxconn-unit-gets-green-light-start-fundraising-us43-billion-ipo]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expectations had been high for its post-IPO stock performance as Chinese regulators unveiled a slew of favourable policies to woo home listings of fast-growing technology companies. Foxconn Industrial waited only 27 days before its IPO application was vetted by regulators, against the 500-plus days for regular IPO candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even after a 33 per cent drop from its all-time high, the company is still valued at 19.2 times estimated earnings for this year, making it pricier than Apple that has a multiple of 16.1 times, according to Bloomberg data. The stock is also 32 per cent more expensive than Midea, China's biggest appliance maker that has already made a concrete step in entering smart manufacturing by acquiring a major stake in Kuka, the world's larger producer of robots used to make cars.We simply view the company as a traditional assembler that has low profit margins and its plan to develop smart manufacturing is still in the storytelling stageDai Ming, Hengsheng Asset Management</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A breakdown on Foxconn Industrial's current sources of revenues does not seem to justify its valuation premium. Manufacturing of phone equipment made up 61 per cent of its sales in 2017, while the proportion of industry robots was less than 0.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market has doubt over how much real hi-tech the company has on hand,” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai. “And its smart manufacturing plan is still the wild card.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sell-side analysts have been slow in adjusting their rating on the stock and the share-price estimates. All the six brokerages including </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> and Ping An Securities that cover the stock, according to Bloomberg, rate the stock a “buy”, setting an average 12-month price target of 22.16 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hengsheng Asset's Dai said Foxconn Industrial would be more reasonably priced at below 15 yuan, which indicates a minimal 13 per cent drop from Friday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market is always right,” said Shanshan Finance's Wu. “There's probably more room for downside on the stock.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With their rosy cheeks, golden horns and cascading purple manes, Anita Caswell Ng Hoi-ying's distinctive unicorn-themed goodies are sure to get the social-media likes rolling in for the students of her Little Miss Macarons baking workshops in Wong Chuk Hang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sitting somewhere between a cake, a biscuit and a meringue, the macaron (not to be confused with the macaroon) originated in medieval Italy before being popularised in France in the 19th century. It has enjoyed a resurgence over the past decade, and Hong Kong baker Caswell Ng's painstakingly decorated and photogenic treats are her signature creations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These days, people need dreams, and unicorns - whether for kids or adults - appeal to people all over the world,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macarons are made by piping meringue and almond-flour mixture into circles and baking at low temperatures before two halves are sandwiched together with jam and butter icing. They are famously tricky to master, especially in a place like Hong Kong, where humidity plays havoc with the egg-white base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then comes the decoration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's very much like a make-up class,” Caswell Ng says. “We put some pearl powder on the macaron like foundation, then use a bronze powder to do the eyes, and then we have pink powder like blush on the cheeks. The hair is made from icing, and the horns and ears are made with fondant.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Food editor Susan Jung shares the secrets of the perfect macaron[https://www.scmp.com/article/713838/sweet-child-mine]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macarons should be savoured slowly to appreciate their flavour, Caswell Ng advises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A good macaron should be slightly crisp on the outside, then, once you bite into it, it's soft and melts in your mouth,” she says. “The filling should give you an aftertaste; it's very much like wine. You bite in, close your eyes and sense a beautiful aftertaste. That's a good macaron.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caswell Ng enjoys teaching others and seeing what variations her apprentices come up with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It takes time, but I love it,” she says. “Seeing people smile makes it all worthwhile.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Little Miss Macarons classes are held at Baking Maniac, in Wong Chuk Hang. Private workshops (for parties of eight to 15 people) cost HK$880 per person and include at least 20 take-home macarons. Visit littlemissmacarons.com[https://littlemissmacarons.com/].</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, China's biggest online health care platform, aims to expand its services in Southeast Asia later this year to cater the growing demand from the region and mainlanders travelling for medical tourism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, officially known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, last Thursday announced the formation of a 70:30 venture with Southeast Asian ride-hailing platform Grab, which will give users in the region access to artificial intelligence-assisted online medical consultations, medicine delivery and appointment bookings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After signing the joint venture agreement, we now need to form the management team,” said Wang Tao, chairman of Ping An Good Doctor. “We hope to see the services in at least one country this year. It is possible Thailand will be the first one.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Thailand is good because of the availability of low-cost, high-quality services provided by private medical centres.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week , a spokeswoman for Grab said that the company is “looking at Indonesia closely”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will also keep an eye on the growing medical tourism market as an increasing number of mainland Chinese looking for international medical services. Wang said they would also cooperate with hospitals in the region to provide online and offline medical services to Chinese users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Medical institutions in Thailand and Indonesia provide good services, and costs are low. And they have a large number of young mobile user population,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia, with a population of about 660 million, has over 200 million mobile users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Ctrip, China's largest online tourism agency, in 2016 over 500,000 outbound medical trips were taken, five times the number in 2015. Average spending was over 50,000 yuan (US$7,286), 10 times the expenditure for individual overseas trips.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Both China and Southeast Asian countries face a shortage of medical services. People in Southeast Asia are willing to pay small amounts for medical consultancy services. I see the market has great growth potential. It will see quicker profit return as we have already built up the infrastructure and Grab has provided a strong network in the region,” Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab has built up a strong network in eight countries and it has more than 20 million monthly active users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's almost half of our monthly active users in China and it also has good relationships with governments in the region,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spun off from </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, China's biggest insurer by market value, Ping An Good Doctor was the first technology unicorn, a start-up valued at over US$1 billion. It listed in Hong Kong in May this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company last week reported its first six-month earnings since going public. Losses narrowed by 2.6 per cent to 444.2 million yuan, while revenue jumped 150 per cent to 1.1 billion yuan from the year-earlier period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said the two companies only took three months to form the joint venture, with help from Masayoshi Son, chief executive of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, Wang said the company was actively exploring diversified forms of partnerships with insurance companies and could form the first one with its parent </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> this year, having already built a payment mechanism for companies to settle their policyholders' claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said he has a target to turn the company profitable. But he does not plan to disclose it as new investment opportunities may alter the timetable.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Tony Cruz-trained Green Manner caught the eye with a gutsy debut performance in the Class Three Fa Po Handicap (1,600m) on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The five-year-old launched his career at Sha Tin off a seasoned 10-run campaign in New Zealand under the same name for trainer Graham Richardson, winning twice over 1,400m at Te Aroha and at Pukekura in the North Island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He showed some response when asked for an effort in an all-weather trial, but it was not enough to catch the attention of punters and the gelding was sent out at 24-1 under Matthew Chadwick.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green Manner jumped alertly with a hood and tongue-tie to settle second behind Shiny Day, and then eased back to sit along the fence in fourth behind Soldier at the 1,200m. He switched off the leader at the 400m, rushed to the lead 300m out and stayed on dourly, only to find the progressive Taknam too good in the final 50m.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is son of exposed Danehill Dancer line which has thrived over varying distances on the local front with 37 winners from 66 starters, the best of whom have been smart sprinters One World (Group Two </span><span class="s3">Cathay Pacific</span><span class="s1"> Jockey Club Sprint winner) and Rich Unicorn (successful over Little Bridge in last season's Group Two Premier Bowl) and the middle-distance victorious pair of Super Satin (2010 Derby winner) and Super Pistachio (2011 Queen Mother Memorial Cup winner). His dam, Galileo mare Snapdragon, raced twice in Great Britain and came away fourth on both occasions over 2,400m and 2,600m and is a half-sister to five winners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green Manner appears to have acclimatised quickly and should be saluting over a mile to 2,000m.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Hong Kong artificial intelligence lab backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and SenseTime, the world's most valuable AI start-up, has named seven companies that will receive funding under its accelerator programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong AI and Data Laboratory announced in a ceremony on Thursday that it will provide US$100,000 in seed funding to each of the selected start-ups, who will also be given office space, access to AI resources from Alibaba and SenseTime, and a range of cloud computing services from Alibaba Cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These start-ups not only have innovative technologies and business ideas, but they also offer valuable solutions for different industries and scenarios,” Jeff Zhang, the chief technology officer of Alibaba, said at the ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said it was important to work on the application of AI technologies in different industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lab was established in May by the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund and SenseTime, which became the city's first unicorn - a start-up valued at more than US$1 billion - in July last year. The lab has partnered with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) to launch the six-month accelerator programme to nurture more AI start-ups in the city.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Accelerator programme participant Dayta, a local start-up that offers computer vision and natural language processing solutions to businesses, predicted demand for AI technologies in Hong Kong to grow steadily.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Artificial intelligence has a lot of potential in the market, which is still very much underserved,” Dayta founder and chief executive Patrick Tu said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tu said he made the decision to start Dayta five months ago, while he was setting up an education start-up. Dayta has already broken even with its initial projects, he said. Those included a project that helps retailers monitor customer traffic and another in which a media organisation automatically analyses data in reports.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong AI Lab was established amid the city government's efforts to step up innovation in areas like AI, biotechnology and financial technology to keep pace with developments in major economies. The government's budget for this year included HK$40 billion for HKSTP to support hi-tech innovation. A separate amount of HK$10 billion was earmarked to establish two technology research clusters focusing on health care technology and AI.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is also looking to increase the adoption of mobile payments as it continues to lag behind other economies in Asia, particularly mainland China. Consumers in the city mostly prefer using cash, credit cards, or stored-value card platforms like Octopus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online payment service AlipayHK on Thursday introduced EasyGo, a payment technology that allows users to pay their transport fares by scanning a QR code to complete the transaction in 0.3 seconds, even when both the user and the bus are offline or have poor network connection.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AlipayHK, a joint venture between tycoon Li Ka-shing's </span><span class="s3">CK Hutchison</span><span class="s1"> Holdings and Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services, has teamed up with two of Hong Kong's biggest mini bus operators, </span><span class="s3">AMS</span><span class="s1"> Public Transportation Holdings and Koon Wing Motors, to make EasyGo technology available on their vehicles, according to a statement from the online payment service. It did not provide the specific date when EasyGo will be made available.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Karl Wong, head of product development at AlipayHK, said EasyGo technology will be adopted to other modes of public transport in Hong Kong. He said it was based on a system already being used in densely populated mainland cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While AlipayHK reported having 1.5 million users in Hong Kong as of the end of June, it found the adoption of mobile payments to be an uphill battle amid the city's attachment to more traditional forms of transactions and concerns over data privacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The joint venture also competes against Western payment services like </span><span class="s3">PayPal</span><span class="s1">, local providers like TNG Wallet and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">' </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> Pay.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s on-demand delivery services unit Ele.me plans to expand a </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> coffee delivery service across more Chinese cities as it ramps up competition with a raft of new entrants including beverages upstart Luckin Coffee, which is backed by </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting from October 22, customers in nine new cities will join those in Beijing and Shanghai in being able to receive </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> coffee deliveries direct to their door, courtesy of Ele.me, Alibaba said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> started delivery services in September in Beijing and Shanghai following the announcement of a partnership with Alibaba the previous month. The service is expected to expand to “more than 2,000 stores across 30 cities by the end of the year,” Belinda Wong, chief executive of Starbucks China, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market for on-demand delivery is crucial for Chinese internet giants as it opens up an entry point to other services such as online payments, and also provides further insights into consumer spending patterns. The expansion also comes amid intensifying competition in China with a partnership forged by Tencent and Luckin in September, which leverages the ecosystem of </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, Tencent's dominant messaging, social media and payment app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin Coffee confirms US$200m in new funding as it aims for even faster delivery[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2155110/chinas-luckin-coffee-confirms-us200-million-raised-latest-funding]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coffee-and-bakery chain Luckin, which began operations in November 2017, has staked out its claim to be a domestic challenger to </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> in China. “</span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> is a great company and has done tremendously well, especially in educating Chinese consumers about coffee,” said CEO Qian Zhiya earlier this year. “But it does not equal coffee in China and neither is it the sole contender,” she said, adding that all countries have local coffee brands.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 44 per cent of Luckin shops opened as of June were effectively “take-out kitchens”, according to the company, which delivers its coffee using the SF Express delivery firm in less than 20 minutes. The Beijing-based start-up claimed a unicorn-status valuation of US$1 billion after raising US$200 million in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It operates 1,003 physical stores in 13 Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai and has sold 26 million cups of coffee as of September 3. The start-up expects to operate 2,000 stores nationwide by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> and Luckin are vying for a bigger share of a fast-growing coffee market in the world's most populous nation. China's total coffee consumption surged 16 per cent annually in the past 10 years compared to the world's average growth of 2 per cent, according to the </span><span class="s3">International Coffee Organization</span><span class="s1"> in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The coffee shop market in China is estimated to be worth over US$4.5 billion as of last year, thanks to years of booming growth, according to </span><span class="s3">Euromonitor</span><span class="s1"> data. </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> is currently China's dominant coffee provider with a market share of about 58.6 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Euromonitor</span><span class="s1">, yet the Seattle-based firm reported a 2 per cent drop in comparable-store sales in China, a rare sales decline for the chain, for the second quarter of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> aims to triple revenue in China over the next five years. It also plans to build about 3,000 new stores in the country over the next few years, doubling the current number of 3,300 stores by the end of 2022, according to a company announcement in May.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year saw record deal activity backed by venture capital (VC) in China, with half of the top 10 largest deals globally by Chinese telecoms and internet companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Topping the list was </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">'s US$5.5 billion financing in April, which emerged as the largest VC-backed deal in the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Preqin, a data service provider for the alternative assets industry, expects an uptick in venture capital investors seeking initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Spotify [is expected] to become publicly traded in 2018, and other venture capital-backed companies may follow suit. A number of VC-backed companies have now grown to valuations that would make them unlikely candidates for trade sales to corporates … as such, becoming publicly listed is the most likely exit strategy for these companies,” said Felice Egidio, head of venture capital products at Preqin.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, the Swedish music-streaming service filed for a listing on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Details of the listing are limited, although the company is reportedly seeking a direct listing on the exchange without an initial public offering to raise additional capital.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment deals backed by venture capital reached a record US$182 billion globally in 2017, with the value up 28 per cent compared with 2016, even as the deal count dropped 4.7 per cent to 11,144. The US dominated the rankings, drawing 42 per cent, or more than US$76.4 billion. Greater China ranked No 2, attracting 36 per cent of total deal value, with US$65 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Preqin said the 2017 deal number and value figures are expected to rise by up to 5 per cent as more information become available. In 2016 Chinese start-ups accounted for seven out of the top-10 financing deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US$5.5 billion financing to </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, which is Asia's biggest unicorn - or start-up companies valued at more than US$1 billion - also amounted to the largest Asia-based VC deal on record.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping ranked as the fourth largest deal after it raised US$4 billion in October from sponsors IDG Capital, </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, Tencent, and GIC among others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, exits deals backed by venture capital - or the method by which a venture capitalist cashes out of a business - amounted to US$71 billion. Of these, 676 exits amounting to US$51.7 billion were completed in North America. China completed 60 exits valued at US$5.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when it comes to fund raising, 2017 stopped short of being the best record for venture capital. For the year, venture capital funds raised US$55 billion while growth funds raised US$39 billion, both lower than in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ironically, it was Hing Chao's time studying in the West that played a hand in his many projects aimed at preserving and promoting traditional Chinese culture. "I was born in Hong Kong, but went to the UK to study, spending my teenage and university years in England. However, my mother thought that my personality had become thoroughly anglicised, which she saw as a problem, so I was sent to Beijing," says Chao, organiser of the ongoing Hong Kong Culture Festival[http://hkculturefestival.com].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sitting at a giant conference table in his Wan Chai office - he works for his family-run shipping firm, the Wah Kwong Group - Chao says that after graduating in philosophy from the University of Durham he spent a year in Beijing, including travels to Inner Mongolia that planted the seeds of a love affair with the cultures of ethnic minorities in the far northeast of China - "the indigenous marginalised peoples in Manchuria … the hunters and gatherers".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2004, he established the Orochen Foundation, a non-profit charity aimed at preserving the culture, language and identity of minority groups in northeast China, focusing mainly on intangible cultural heritage, aspects that include song, music, dance, drama and festivals, aspects that can be recorded but cannot be touched or stored in physical form.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And his passion for cultural preservation also extends to Hong Kong, where Chao is a major supporter of heritage conservation and martial arts. "Hong Kong didn't pay much attention to historical buildings until 1997, when the change of sovereignty was a marker for how Hong Kong people looked at ourselves and our past."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chao says the turning point came after the demolition of Queen's Pier in 2008, which created an uproar among conservationists, and sparked protests in the city that included then-legislator Law Chi-kwong swimming in Victoria Harbour and a hunger strike by three students at the pier. Other protestors camped at the site.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chao says the backlash took the government by surprise. "The public outcry was highly unexpected," says Chao, who also refers to the 78-year-old King Yin Lei mansion on Stubbs Road, Mid-Levels, as another milestone for heritage conservation. In 2008 the building was spared from the wrecking ball after public pressure forced the government to intervene.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for his favourite heritage building in Hong Kong, Chao says he has many, but a standout is the Blue House in Wan Chai that reflects his love for both heritage buildings and martial arts. "The Blue House is close to me personally," Chao says of the grade one historic building on Stone Nullah Lane that was part of a HK$100 million plan by the Housing Society and the Urban Renewal Authority to preserve nine Chinese-style buildings in the district.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the 1950s, the distinctive blue building houseda martial arts school run by Lam Cho. "I'm a practising martial artist, so I'm mindful of the history of trans-martial arts in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To say Chao loves martial arts is something of an understatement. Obsession is more apt. He has studied several styles of southern Chinese martial arts, holds a second dan black belt in Shotokan-style karate, is a qualified kick-boxing instructor and founder of the Journal of Chinese Martial Studies, the first English-language research periodical focused on the study of Chinese martial arts culture and indigenous sports. In 2008, he co-founded the International Guoshu Association, the only non-profit organisation dedicated to the research and reconstruction of Chinese sports and classical martial arts (he's also the association's chief executive).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2013, Chao co-authored Hung Kuen Fundamentals: Fok Fu Kuen with Lam Chun-fai, the highest authority in hung kuen, a type of kung fu discipline. He says the book aims to keep alive a 300-year-old martial arts style that focuses on deep, low stances and strong hand techniques.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it is Chao's latest project - the Hong Kong Culture Festival, which started last month and runs until October 18 - that could leave the deepest imprint on the city's cultural fabric.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This festival is about promoting and sustaining local intangible cultural heritage through activities centred on martial arts, lion dance, Hakka unicorn dance, contemporary ink wash, Cantonese opera, Taoist music and other local traditions … it's an integrated platform for the traditional culture of Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a platform that is desperately needed if the city is to restore the traditions that were diluted by its colonial past, he says. "While it added another layer of culture to the city, colonialism also diluted local traditions. Hong Kong is deeply anchored in British colonial history … all our institutions are modelled after the British, including our schools, the legal system and the public service. For this reason, traditional culture has existed on the periphery, it was never properly institutionalised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Go to any school and you'll see that the disciplines of maths and science are all modelled after the West. The physical education, too - there is basketball, athletics, rugby. But where are the martial arts? Chinese culture has a certain space in the Hong Kong education system, but it's not an important space."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He says the city's rapid development and modernisation has also resulted in the loss of the old communities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The city's social fabric has become fragmented and because of this displacement and transformation, a lot of traditional customs were removed. We need to construct a new platform - a new showcase for people to understand what Hong Kong heritage is."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through the Looking-Glass: And What Alice Found There by Lewis Carroll Macmillan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Readers familiar with this book's 1865 precursor, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, won't be surprised to find that everything in its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, is topsy-turvy. This even begins with the book's jacket: Lewis Carroll is a pseudonym for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Since the author's identity is not the whole truth, it makes sense that he should have become known as a laureate of nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The very title of this novella provides a clue as to what we are going to encounter: the looking glass reflects to Alice the world as she knows it. But, as a child - able to easily comprehend alternative realities - she reinterprets this world and creates a parallel, magical realist version of her own when she steps through the mirror.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The truth as we know it is suddenly inverted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Within this world, everything is back to front. Alice picks up a book to find the text is reversed in the poem Jabberwocky (a nonsense poem Carroll began before he wrote Through the Looking-Glass). In order to get where she wants to go, she must walk in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reality is parodied: unicorns are incredulous at the idea of a real human being - Alice is described as a "fabulous monster". When Alice cuts a cake, the unicorn tells her looking-glass cakes should be handed around first and cut after. Sure enough, the advice works. For in this world, events precede actions. Crimes are punished before they are committed, and fingers feel pain before they are pricked. Logic and ideas are inverted, often through riddles and word puzzles spoken by personified objects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alice is at first confused by all this nonsense, and the White Queen tells her it's "the effect of living backwards". Carroll challenges his readers to invert their perceptions of reality and enter the world of the child, the imagination, the dream, in order to make sense of his nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only by accepting this version of reality can the book be truly appreciated, just as Alice herself becomes more accustomed to the strangeness she encounters. In the looking-glass world, she is a pawn in a chess game, trying to reach the eighth square to become a queen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just as in dreams, the action jumps seamlessly from a wood, to a shop, to a boat. With his protagonist at the mercy of unseen forces, maybe Carroll is suggesting we all are victims of a predetermined fate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But finally Alice awakes from this dream world, and Carroll provides an epilogue in the form of a poem that suggests life itself is a kind of dream. Carroll, in his perpetually avuncular tone, asks us to rethink. We should remember that we have the ability not only to look at our true selves in a mirror, but also within ourselves - and also perhaps even trust the nonsense of dreams.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inspired by the huge success of companies that make a business out of sharing cars and housing, China is going through a bout of a sharing boom, with increasing number of seemingly shareable products and services, from bicycles to power banks, to baby strollers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As many as 600 million people were involved in activities related to China's sharing economy last year, with transactions estimated at US$500 billion, according to the State Information Centre. Economic activity around sharing could account for as much as 10 per cent of China's gross domestic product by 2020, the centre said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What the report didn't specify is its definition of the “sharing economy” in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sharing economy typified by </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> or Uber, both of which now have market capitalizations in the billions is becoming China's latest business fad. However, the concept in China might differ from </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> or Uber's definition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Not many of those companies belong truly in the sharing economy,” said Tan Jing , investor and one of the founding members of Uber China. “The sharing economy is a trade-off between private individuals. It's a way to make the most of the social surplus.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's three dozen bicycle sharing services, with their ride-anywhere and park-anywhere business model, uses the public space as their parking spots, which increases management cost for the government and sometimes even cause inconvenience for the public, so they're “not the real essence of the sharing economy,” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many pedestrians and local governments might agree. The boom in bike sharing services across the mainland has generated complaints about illegal parking, traffic violations and dumped cycles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Profiting at the cost of public resources is not the only problem. How many of those “sharing economy” companies are profitable is still a question.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When we talk about sharing economy, we have to think about what has the lowest use ratio and highest price. Only those who fit the criteria have actual sharing value,” said Pan Shiyi, chairman of SOHO China. “If you start to share cheap things like umbrellas and power banks, the concept of sharing economy is distorted.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That might partly explain why the pioneer of the business model was usurped by the pretender, as Uber's China business was bought out by Didi-Chuxing, after burning through billions of dollars in the market. </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post, owns 6 per cent of Didi. The ride-sharing company is valued at US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's taxi price is relatively low, and Uber didn't have much competitive advantage in China,” said Tan. “That's why the real car-sharing companies can only survive in countries like the United States where taxi fares are much higher.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of the trendy sharing companies in China are in fact rental businesses, Tan said. “Didi has more taxi companies on its platform than private car owners. It's more like an online car-hiring company now,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So why do startups want to pass themselves off as sharing economy businesses? That's because venture capital and angel investors love the buzzword.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Successful business like Didi has a strong demonstration effect,” said Shu Huan, chief executive of venture capital database company VC Smart. “The investor might not be genuinely interested in this ‘sharing economy' project, but they don't want to miss out the next Didi.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By packaging themselves as a sharing economy, some startups are offering themselves to investors as the chance to get in on the next unicorn, as companies with at least US$1 billion in valuation are called.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When you say you are a rental company, investors compare you with the library, or traditional car hiring firms. But when you say you are a sharing-economy company, they will compare you with </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">. That's called comparable company valuation, and it got many start-ups valued at a much higher price than they worth,” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">VC Smart data shows 23 per cent of the 329 “sharing economy” startups have been financed, which is much higher than ventures in other fields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past month, three umbrella sharing startups have raised several million yuan from investors, even as doubts remain as to how their business models work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, those startups still have their business value even if they can't make any profits for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The online market is quite mature now. The cost of getting a new user online is not much cheaper, sometimes is even more expensive, than attracting a new customer offline,” said Shu. “Business like bike-sharing or umbrella-sharing can be a good way to catch new customers offline and direct the new traffic to their online or other profitable businesses.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ofo, one of China's biggest bike-sharing companies, has raised a US$700 million Series E funding round led by Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent, which operates China's largest social media network, led a US$600 million financing round of another bike-sharing startup Mobike. By asking bike hirers to use Alipay or Wechat as payment methods, the much smaller but highly popular bike rental companies have become an efficient channel to attract new customers for those online giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maybe some companies should call themselves ‘sharing economy,' but the real opportunities are not in sharing anyway,” said Shu. “Rental business has a lot of more potential to explore in China.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Chinese developers paid a record HK$16.86 billion (US$2.17 billion) for a plot of residential land at Ap Lei Chau, topping market valuations by almost 50 per cent, making it Hong Kong's most expensive lump-sum sale to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A land parcel measuring 126,500 square feet (11,752 square metres) was sold by tender to Unicorn Bay (Hong Kong) Investments, according to the Land Department's data. The buyer is a venture between Logan Property Holdings[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=3380&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] of Shenzhen, and Guangzhou-based KWG Property Holding .[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1813&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With total gross floor area of 762,091 sq ft , the price translates to HK$22,118 per square foot in land cost. Property agents expect apartments on the site to sell for at least HK$32,000 per sq ft, a record for the district.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ap Lei Chau, Cantonese for “duck's tongue peninsula,” is a small island connected by a bridge to the south of Hong Kong island, near the Aberdeen fish market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sale is the government's largest lump-sum sale, exceeding the HK$11.82 billion fetched in 1997 for a Siu Sai Wan site that's now home of the Island Resort.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The record price undermines the assertion by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying that a November 2016 policy to raise the stamp duty for individual second-home buyers to 15 per cent had “achieved its goal” in deterring speculative buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First-time buyers made up 95 per cent of January's residential property sales, while home sales requiring a double, or 15 per cent, stamp duty plunged 83 per cent to 406 transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These figures show the government's efforts to suppress investment demand for flats have been effective,” Leung said this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from bolstering the government's coffers, buoyant land sales boost overall market sentiment and encourage apartment owners to raise their selling prices, property analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government should speed up the release of more land for sale to stabilise the housing market, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The aggressive bidding shows that developers outside Hong Kong see the city's property market as an attractive place to invest in, taking into account the limited new land supply and well established property transaction system,” said Lau Chun-kong, head of the valuation department at property consultant JLL. “The government must increase land supply if they hope to maintain a healthy and stable housing market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's land supply for private housing will be enough for almost 32,000 flats in 2017, surpassing targets for the fourth year, the government said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government plans to sell 28 plots of land for private housing in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, and will provide almost 19,000 flats, with the remainder coming from railway property, urban renewal and private redevelopment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That supply is still not enough, making it hard for buyers to find apartments, Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ap Lei Chau site, expected to become a luxury residential property enclave, won't immediately affect the price of mass housing, but it'll boost the overall market sentiment, said Alvin Lam, director of Midland Realty's valuation department.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese developers will continue to snap up prime sites in Hong Kong, paying a premium to squeeze out local builders, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, the Chinese conglomerate that owns </span><span class="s3">Hainan Airlines</span><span class="s1">, paid a total of HK$20 billion to buy three parcels of land at Hong Kong's former Kai Tak airport in three months through January.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The raging cut-throat competition in China's power bank sharing sector will knock out some small players before a stable competitive landscape emerges this year, say industry players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector is also growing at an exponential pace, with the influx of capital inflows from internet giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed industry player Xiaodian has begun operations in 33 cities in just about three months since the company came into the market on March 12.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We'd probably be in 144 cities, if you ask me for the data a month later, “ said Tang Yongbo, founder of Xiaodian, arguably the market leader for power bank rental that has raised a total of 450 million yuan (US$66 million), by far the biggest amount in the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rival Ankerbox said the ferocious battle to grab market share came earlier than expected, and to a large part due to the capital inflows from China's internet giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In order to not miss the business opportunities, most internet leaders are taking a proactive approach with early investment in these start-ups,” said Yuan Yuan, CEO of the Shenzhen-based power bank rental firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland media reported that an estimated 1.2 billion yuan from 35 venture capital firms have already poured money into the power bank sharing business by April.In order to not miss the business opportunities, most internet leaders are taking a proactive approach with early investment in these start-upsYuan Yuan, Ankerbox</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With ample capital available, Ankerbox said it now operated in 20 cities and would cover all Chinese tier-one and tire-two cities by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market for power banks sharing is potentially massive given the huge number of mobile phone users in China and their long hours of usage . iResearch data shows that Chinese users on average spend nearly 3 hours a day on their smartphones for social networking, viewing videos and shopping online.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The major players said they were are also eyeing the global market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are planning to step into overseas markets; cities with big population and smartphone users, and with developed online payment system will be our first choice, “ Yuan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On home turf though, the stiff competition was expected to force out weaker players, market players said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The players in power bank sharing sector will be quickly reshuffled with the influx of capital inflows, and we will see a stable competitive landscape in the second half of the year, “ said Allen Zhu Xiaohu, managing director and partner at GSR Ventures and an investor of Xiaodian.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What we care most in an investment are two factors: how often are customers willing to use it [product] and how it will make money,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At present, the battle for market share has resulted in price war with the likes of Xiaodian slashing the rental fee to 1 fen per usage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The main purpose of lowering prices is to attract customers to learn about and try the new products,” said Xiaodian's Tang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Subsidies are common in the internet industry and I think it is just a way to attract the customers to adopt to the new kind service quickly,” said Ankerbox's Yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For decades, aspiring entrepreneurs all over the world have looked to Silicon Valley to find inspiration for the next big idea in technology. On the other side of the Pacific, China has worked hard to encourage company founders to set up shop, but Beijing's strict internet controls don't appeal to the open minded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now, instead of shunning China because of its censorship restrictions, some adventurous entrepreneurs are seeing opportunities behind China's Great Firewall, where an isolated market with more than 750 million internet users and abundant venture capital create fertile soil to turn start-up ideas into reality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of those adventurous is Grant Long, Silicon Valley born and bred, who moved to Shanghai late last year to set up a business that provides personalised digital expressions, such as animated GIFs and Emoji, to Chinese consumers who use a set of digital communication tools that are different from the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Communist Party rebukes China's internet watchdog for ‘lax' control over cyberspace[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2097947/chinas-internet-regulator-rebuked-communist-party-lax]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Great Firewall makes China a closed internet ecosystem. It is a challenge but it now serves as an advantage for us," said Long, whose start-up BiaoqingYun offers solutions for a long list of Chinese digital communications tools, including </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holding</span><span class="s1">'s QQ, a messaging app used by more than 800 million people each month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Outside China, tools like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1"> rule people's social and messaging life online. But in China, none of those work. That gives us the opportunity to use our Western perspective to come up with something tailored to the digital communication demands of China," Long said, adding that the</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">country's huge population makes it possible to operate a very successful business even if it only serves China's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Critics argue that true innovation cannot flourish in a country that stifles free of speech and limits access to information, but China proves to be the exception to that rule. In fact, censorship and an isolated internet are often the spark behind many of the country's tech and innovation breakthroughs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, China is already a world leader in online shopping applications and mobile payments thanks to its role as the world's biggest e-commerce market. In mobile internet applications, the country's tech firms are taking the lead in enabling consumers to order food and rent shared bikes with just a few swipes on a smartphone. Moreover, the world's second largest economy has been ramping up efforts to create the next Silicon Valley by introducing favourable policies and tax breaks for the tech sector.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, none of this changes the fact that China's internet environment is cut off from the rest of the world. In fact, the central government has been imposing tighter controls on virtual private networks which give people on the mainland access to banned websites that include </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">New York Times</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Justin Ren, an associate professor at Boston University, said the Great Firewall may have offer some benefits in terms of keeping foreign competition out of China, but it also has long-term detrimental effects.That gives us the opportunity to use our Western perspective to come up with something tailored to the digital communication demands of ChinaGrant Long, BiaoqingYun</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For one thing, people are not getting the full information on what exactly other innovative countries are doing. In today's information age, having partial information equals weaker competitive advantage," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Industry insiders say the restrictions on foreign search and social media in China over the past decade have enabled mainland internet giants like Baidu and Tencent to grow into what they are today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But this phenomenon is mostly over now. Chinese internet companies can now compete with foreign internet companies on ability," said Jeffrey Towson, an investment professor at China's elite </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> would get very far in China today, and most foreign smartphone companies, including Apple and </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1">, are really struggling against Chinese competitors."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There weren't really any limits that protected Didi against Uber last year and they won handily. Chinese internet companies can beat you fair and square," he said, adding that in most cases the Great Firewall is more for security concerns and political sensitivity, not to protect the emergence of national champions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment going into China's start-ups is growing steadily and access to funds remains a strong attraction for entrepreneurs, both domestically and internationally. So far in 2017, 41 global technology companies have reached unicorn status, defined as privately held companies valued at more than US$1 billion, according to US research firm CB Insights. Most are in still in the US, but China has seen 15 new unicorns form this year while Europe has five.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What's more, Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, have invested in 46 per cent of all China's unicorns, according to CB Insights. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Yi Jingping, a computer science graduate who co-founded a retail discount platform company two years ago, said he still wants to build his own business despite the challenges of accessing banned content. "The conditions for starting up a company in Beijing are more than perfect," Yi said. "There are many people that have had success around me. It's easy to get funds."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi often seeks inspiration from accessing sites that may be blocked in China. "For a technician, the ability to get around the firewall is a basic skill. I don't think [internet censorship] has a big impact [on what I do]."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But China's heavy handed approach to regulating the internet may be hardest on firms that have foreign clients. Some consider China's new cyber security law, which requires personal information and data collected or generated in China to be stored on the mainland, a major concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Already you need to have data on local servers here, but this could impact moving more of that business locally from abroad," said Stewart Philips, Asia-Pacific business development manager for Event Bank, a cloud-based management platform based in Beijing. "For some things, organisations and companies are happy to comply because the cost of operating and doing business in China is lower. But at a certain point with data it gets a bit trickier because this is sensitive information."</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dapper Boy was his own worst enemy last term, but returns as a seemingly more composed individual and should be able to settle in behind a suitably fast speed at Sha Tin on Monday after showing some encouraging signs of relaxing in a barrier trial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The David Hall-trained four-year-old can act as a banker in the final leg of the Triple Trio at the National Day meeting, a low draw adding confidence to his claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his first season of racing, Dapper Boy was well-supported in his three starts, but needed the experience as his tendency to overrace brought him undone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 1,050m trial, where Weichong Marwing restrained the solid sprinter out of the gates, wasn't perfect, but it did seem an improvement on the hefty gelding's previous intractably green efforts. Best of all, Dapper Boy charged home without any urging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A hot tempo should help Marwing settle Dapper Boy from gate five. Bear Elite, who is first up and with aggressive Matthew Chadwick aboard, should find the front, and Vincent Ho Chak-yiu should reprise his last-start tactics on The Prince from a wide barrier. Throw the two claiming apprentices into the mix - Alvin Ng Ka-chun on Solar Up and Dicky Lui Chek-yeung kicking up from gate one on Ming Hoi Glory - and Dapper Boy won't have any chance to overrace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next in is Holyangelholy (Tye Angland) - with blinkers on and dropping back to 1,200m after an infuriating display as favourite last time out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holyangelholy was a devilish ride for Douglas Whyte, showing surprisingly erratic racing manners and perhaps as a result, was flat-footed and one-paced when they dashed. He, too, will be helped by solid sectionals and the ever-thoughtful Size isn't frivolous about his gear changes, nor anything he does with a horse, so it's fair to expect improvement with the move to shades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a race that drops away sharply, Bear Elite should be forward and will run a race, while Nightlign (Zac Purton) should improve off his first-up run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first leg is up the straight and at first glance the obvious banker seems to be Castle Hero (Ho) after a solid first-up run behind Dane Patrol last weekend, but persistent lameness issues for a horse on a seven-day back-up leave some doubts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drawing one could also leave him facing the breeze as he was last start and doing all the work in the run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oriental Prosper, a first-up winner last season and with Ng's claim bringing him down to a similar weight, gets the cover of the grandstand rail and is an option as a banker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead of standing one out, maybe play narrow with four, including Castle Hero, Oriental Prosper, Bould Mover (Chadwick) and Flying Smart (Brett Prebble), whose first-up fifth was better than it looks on paper. An outsider to consider is one from the trials - Keen Tactics (Eddie Lai Wai-ming).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle leg looks like Lui's best chance of breaking through for his first win on Cosmo One - but drawn inside him are two other on-pace runners that won't make it easy for him to get the rail or a two-wide spot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Include Cosmo One, who is well-treated with the 10-pound allowance, but go for Purton on Meridian Treasure as a banker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drawn six, Purton has the one-dimensional Ferrabosco outside him and can disrupt the big grey's rhythm and then find a perfect spot just behind the speed. Kensworth Kid (Olivier Doleuze) peaked on his run last start after being asked to sprint early.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He will be better for that run and will appreciate any pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Others to consider are Breeze Of Luck (Marwing) and Kingston Spartacus (Lai), with Global Fame (Richard Fourie) a place chance despite his wide draw.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thousands of cups of Hong Kong's "silk-stocking" milk tea will be served to visitors at an exhibition in Taiwan showcasing the city's cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Intangible cultural heritage will take centre stage at Hong Kong Week 2014 in Taipei, the third annual showcase presented by the Hong Kong-Taiwan Cultural Cooperation Committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The October 17 to November 2 exhibition will feature 480 items that best represent the Hong Kong community and provide cultural continuity. "We can showcase Hong Kong history, tradition, personality and local products," said committee convenor Fredric Mao Chun-fai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previous Hong Kong Week exhibitions have featured contemporary art, music, design and dance. This year's event would feature a mix of serious and lighthearted attractions, Mao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chau Hing-wah, curator of the </span><span class="s3">Heritage Museum</span><span class="s1">, told the South China Morning Post the exhibition would feature items of cultural heritage not included in </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">'s list or the national list, but which were on the city's inventory, such as Hong Kong-style milk tea. Hong Kong's inventory was announced in June and was drawn up following passage of a UN convention on safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simon Wong Ka-wor, chairman of the Association of Coffee and Tea of Hong Kong - which runs the International Kam Cha, or milk tea, competition to pick the master milk tea brewer - said Mok Pui-ling, last year's champion, would make 2,000 cups of milk tea at the exhibition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The association estimates Hongkongers drink 2.5 million cups of milk tea per day at nearly 10,000 milk-tea outlets in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said Hong Kong-style, silk-stocking milk tea - named because it is served strained through a cloth bag similar to women's tights - was nearly a century old and had a very different taste from "bubble milk tea".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Few places in Taiwan serve Hong Kong-style milk tea," Wong said. "It is still something very new to the Taiwanese."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the association would be sponsoring materials for the demonstrations in Taipei, including equipment, paper cups, tea leaves, milk and sugar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will provide enough to supply about 2,000 cups," he said. "This is a great opportunity - not just to promote the cultural heritage of Hong Kong, but also to help brand the city."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other heritage items on show at the exhibition, covering more than 1,000 square metres, will include a Unesco-listed Cantonese opera performance and a bamboo theatre, as well as a six-metre King of Ghosts paper statue, one of the icons of the Cheung Chau Bun Festival - which is on the national heritage list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unesco-listed herbal tea will also be presented, alongside the Tai Hang fire dragon dance, Tai O dragon boat water parade and Yu Lan Ghost Festival, which all feature on the national list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chau said a number of items for which national listing was sought last year would feature in the exhibition, including Hong Kong Quanzhen temples, Taoist ritual music, Wong Tai Sin beliefs and customs, the production technique for the seven-stringed guqin instrument, and a Hakka unicorn dance.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, China's ride hailing giant, may be slowing down its plan to raise funds and could be considering an IPO in the second half of next year partly because the need for fresh financing has been less pressing, according to people familiar with the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Didi was actively seeking to raise fresh capital by issuing US dollar convertible bonds, a type of debt security that can be converted into stock, but Didi is now slowing down its fundraising moves partly because competitor </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping has also been easing back on the expansion of its ride hailing business, said the people familiar, who declined to be identified because the information is private.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financing plans are fluid though and can change on market conditions, the people familiar said. A Didi spokeswoman declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, China's largest provider of on-demand online services, and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> are two of China's most valuable unicorns, with valuations of US$30 billion and US$56 billion respectively based on their latest venture capital fundraising rounds last year. Last month, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> filed an application for an IPO in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment Banks are working on the fundraising plans for Didi and </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and have set up separate teams to keep the two companies' information confidential as they are competitors, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi are among Chinese Internet companies that are building online platforms for services as they seek to make their apps more sticky for users. This trend of building everyday apps where Chinese Internet giants are doing everything is one of the trends identified in the China Internet Report [https://www.abacusnews.com/china-internet-report/] co-authored by the Post, Abacus and 500 Startups and released this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ride-hailing king Didi now wants to help cities solve traffic jams [https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2154027/chinas-biggest-ride-hailing-platform-wants-crunch-its-data-improve]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi did not start out as direct rivals. In 2010, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> was founded by serial entrepreneur Wang Xing as China's answer to Groupon, the US discount e-commerce player, while in 2012, Didi was established by former Alibaba employee Cheng Wei as China's answer to Uber, the US ride hailing giant. Before 2016, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi were barely competitors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between 2012 and 2016, Didi got busy strengthening its presence in the cash-burning ride hailing business in China, which saw it acquiring rivals Kuaidi and Uber China. Didi became the dominant ride-hailing giant in China, and handled more than seven billion rides last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During that time, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> was gradually expanding into various businesses including food delivery, dining, local listings and online travel. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> merged with Dianping in 2016, which was then a local listing and restaurant review firm, taking a 50 per cent stake in the new company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s recent filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s founding members, Wang Xing, Mu Rongjun and Wang Huiwen, together hold dominant voting rights over 59 per cent of </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only at the end of 2016, when Wang Xing personally participated in the series C financing for China's bike sharing firm Mobike for an undisclosed amount, did </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi begin to square off in the mobility sector. Months before Wang's interest in Mobike, Didi poured tens of millions of dollars into Ofo, Mobike's major rival in China's hot dockless bike sharing sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last February, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> started to touch upon the ride hailing business by initiating trials in Nanjing. This March, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> announced it was entering the ride hailing sector in Shanghai. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> said it gained 30 per cent of the ride hailing market with a peak of 300,000 daily orders in Shanghai within its first three day of operations. Numbers were helped by heavy subsidies to both ride hailers and drivers. The price to take a ride with </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> can be no more than 5 yuan (US$0.75), while it should be at least 14 yuan (US$2) with a taxi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan unveils US$2.9bn loss as it prepares investors for long haul in IPO filing [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2152287/meituan-unveils-us29bn-loss-it-prepares-investors-long-term-hong-kong-ipo]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> declined to comment on how much cash it set aside for ride subsidies in Shanghai and Nanjing. A Meituan spokesman said the rationale behind its move into ride hailing was that “local transport is a core service in the everyday lives our customers … We are evaluating the synergies that ride hailing services can bring to our platform, including higher user stickiness.” And the ride hailing business is “not a competition just based on subsidies,” according to the spokesman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s potential IPO investors have a different way of thinking though. “</span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> relies heavily on subsidies to maintain and get more market share for their ride hailing, food delivery, online travel agency and other sprawling businesses,” said Alex Au, managing director of Alphalex Capital Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If new competition emerges, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will need to burn more money to keep market share. How many sticky users they can maintain remains a question no one can answer,” said Au.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s other major move to bolster its transport business was the full acquisition of Mobike, the Beijing-based bike sharing unicorn, for US$2.7 billion in April this year. Didi meanwhile, took over the operations of smaller bike sharing company Bluegogo at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> hasn't expanded its ride hailing business further into any other major Chinese cities. “One of the resistance points </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> might face is from transport regulators, especially for operating licences,” said Xue Yu, analyst at research firm IDC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's Meituan in US$2.7 billion deal to buy bike-sharing firm Mobike [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2140187/chinas-meituan-buys-bicycle-sharing-firm-mobike-mobility-push]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April this year, Didi answered back by starting a food delivery business — a market where </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba-owned Ele.me have dominated. IDC's Xue described this as a “defensive move” from Didi. Didi said its food delivery platform received 334,000 orders on its launch day in Wuxi, southern Jiangsu province in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi's food delivery business now operates in four cities - Wuxi, Nanjing, Taizhou and Chengdu, again using heavy subsidies to reduce the price of a typical order to as low as two yuan (US$0.3).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's always better for customers when there's a new player entering the food delivery business. And Didi's entry will provide more of a counterbalance to the industry,” said Xie Pu, a Changsha-based technology columnist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Didi and </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> have been loss-making. In </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s prospectus, the company reported an adjusted net loss of 2.85 billion yuan last year, 5.35 billion yuan in 2016 and 5.91 billion yuan in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s net loss has narrowed in recent years, the Hong Kong market may not quite be ready to welcome loss-making companies in the same way that the US market does.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong investors believe more in the bottom lines of companies,” Alphalex Management Capital's Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Didi's IPO still some way in the distance it might be too early for investors to gauge valuation and size, but one thing is sure - it will receive the same careful examination as Hong Kong's canny IPO investors are giving </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> right now.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the eve of what could possibly be the world's biggest initial public offering this year, has the fizz gone out of Hong Kong's market?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 87 companies that raised funds in the city this year, 53 per cent of the total traded at prices below their offering prices in their first month of trading, according to Bloomberg data. And 20 companies fell below their offering prices on their trading debut.Investors need to be careful, as it's unclear if all these listings can be digested by the market and receive a positive responseAlvin Cheung Chi-wai, associate director, Prudential Brokerage</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These also included high-profile technology stocks, the very group of new-economy darlings that exchange officials were so convinced would be the future of the bourse that they overhauled the listing rules to accommodate them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overpricing and excessively large fundraising targets are some of the headwinds investors appear to be facing in Hong Kong, especially as many technology and biotechnology companies that go public are still making losses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance, the city's largest technology IPO of 2017, was overbought by 391 times and it's shares soared by as much as 57 per cent within six days of its debut. But it is now trading 17 per cent below its IPO price. Similarly, </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> is trading 50 per cent down from its IPO price, Razer is down 41 per cent and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, also known as Good Doctor, is down by 21 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In this climate, how Xiaomi's US$10 billion IPO - expected next month - fares could determine how attractive Hong Kong's newly overhauled equity market might seem to other Chinese unicorns considering large valuations and fundraising. The company is the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, and a lot will be riding on the success of its listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, what does a disappointing performance by past IPOs mean for the city's biggest listing reform in 25 years? In April, the Hong Kong stock exchange began allowing flotations by companies with dual-class shareholding structures and new economy firms from the biotechnology sector that do not have revenue yet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city is gearing up for a pipeline of blockbuster IPOs this year that could amount to about US$40 billion in total, according to some estimates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a stock drops significantly after its IPO, people will ask where the supporting [price] point is,” said Kevin Leung, executive director of investment strategy at Haitong International Securities. “But it is hard to know as this is a whole new business category, with no comparables.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Underwriting banks and IPO sponsors, for a fee ranging between 3 and 6 per cent of the value of the deal, aim to set reasonable expectations ahead of time and advocate for the well-known “opening day pop” by pricing IPOs at a modest discount to allow about 20 per cent upside on market debut, as an incentive for active trading thereafter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/35f5b7a8-657a-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_191044.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First day trading is often very different from long-term investment performance, as flipping and reselling a hot IPO stock in the first few days to earn a quick profit has increasingly become a practice. Stocks might also often record a downturn with the expiration of their six-month lock-in period, during which pre-IPO investors are prohibited from selling their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when IPOs end up selling below their offering prices within a year, after soaring in the first day or week of trading, then this could be an important indicator of demand being weaker than expected, and could imply that the actual price should have been lower. And if a stock does not record even an opening day pop, this could act as a stronger signal for the relative values of similar companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class listing rules require that companies have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion at listing, or have a market capitalisation of at least HK$10 billion at listing and revenue of at least HK$1 billion in their most recently audited financial year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/2603ddbc-657e-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_191044.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means most companies are likely to be big enough to be included in benchmark indexes soon after their flotation, allowing increased flows to support the stock, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Chinese unicorns considering going public this year seem to be bigger, better-known household names than the ones last year: Lu.com, the online and mobile financial services platform; the ride-sharing giant Didi; </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, a big provider of on-demand online services; </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, the operator of China's biggest online payment platform; and financial technology unicorn WeLab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But scepticism persists: did the projected growth at ZhongAn, Yixin, Razer and Good Doctor justify their high market caps? All four companies are underperforming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as expected interest rate increases by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> are also weighing on market conditions this year, and have triggered fears that money may be sucked out of Asia and into the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors need to be careful, as it's unclear if all these listings can be digested by the market and receive a positive response. Valuations have been aggressive,” said Alvin Cheung Chi-wai, associate director at Prudential Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at SharesPost Research, said Xiaomi's reported gross margin of 13 per cent for 2017 was about three times lower than Apple's 38 per cent, and four times lower than </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1">'s 47 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has performed well in India and needs to replicate this success in Brazil, Indonesia and other developing countries, said Kulkarni.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is rumoured that Xiaomi has persuaded institutional investors in the US and Europe to value its business at no less than US$70 billion, falling back from the US$100 billion initially expected. Based on its 2017 adjusted net profit of about 5.4 billion yuan (US$841 million), this would give the Beijing-based company a price to earnings ratio of 80 to 120 times, well above Apple's 18 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/dc5ca34a-6584-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_191044.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-leader of the National Public Offering Group at Deloitte China, said the maturity of Hong Kong's stock market - because of its large investor base made up of institutional investors - meant it was able to better price an IPO to meet demand. In 2016, 77 per cent of Hong Kong's securities trading was made up of exchange participants and institutional investors, with the remaining 23 per cent coming from retail investors, according to a survey by bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Au said he still expected the Hong Kong IPO market to shrink this year, mainly driven by listings of small and medium-sized companies and biotechnology firms, compared with jumbo listings by Chinese financial institutions in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He forecast the market to continue slipping to about US$20-24 billion in 2018, compared with US$35 billion in 2017, which itself was the smallest amount since the financial crisis in 2008.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wondering what to do on the weekend? With at least 90 different running and multisport races, ranging from one to 173 kilometres long, taking place between now and the end of April next year, there's good reason - whatever your fitness level - to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From road to trail, a leisurely charity walk to speedy competitive runs, an easy loop round the Peak on Hong Kong Island to the challenging Pat Sin Leng ridge in the northeast New Territories, the variety of events is mind-boggling. With trail running alone - arguably the fastest growing sport in Hong Kong in recent years - there are at least 60 events, more than four times than in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are eight races that whet our appetite for running.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lamma 8</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: November 12</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Tai Wan To Beach, Yung Shue Wan, Lamma Island?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 8km run with a mix of concrete and trail</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: a charity run organised by the Child Welfare Scheme, a local charity that supports disadvantaged children and their families, this is the first event of its kind on Lamma. The route goes past the Lamma wind turbine and a scenic mountain trail, before looping back to the start. It's an easy hike for beginners and can be a challenge for runners racing against the clock. The race ends with a beach music festival featuring local bands, food and drinks, market stalls, beach games and children's activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">cwshk.org/NewsandEvents/Lamma8.aspx</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSIG 50 Series - Lantau Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: December 4</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Lantau Island?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 16km, 27km and 50km trail run</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: rub shoulders with some of the region's and world's best trail runners, such as Ultra Trail Mont Blanc champions Caroline Chaverot and Ludovic Pommeret of France in this event that doubles up as the Asian Skyrunning Championships. The race is part of the MSIG 50 Series, which also includes an event on Hong Kong Island (Oct 23) and Sai Kung (Feb 18). The 16km route covers no major peaks, unlike the longer routes, and has a generous six-hour cut-off - ideal if you're just getting started in trail running.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">actionasiaevents.com</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aberdeen Boat Club &amp; Beneteau Four Peaks Race</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: January 21 to January 22, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: all around Hong Kong?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: Asia's ultimate sailing and hill running challenge that covers between 55 to 90 nautical miles (101km to 167km).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: an annual overnight multisport race organised by the Aberdeen Boat Club since 1985, the race brings together the sailing and running community for an endurance feat which takes on average 24 hours to complete. Typically, competitors set off from Tai Tam Bay on the Saturday morning, sailing towards Lantau. There, runners are dropped off in an allocated zone and travel to shore via a small boat or kayak and ascend Lantau Peak (934 metres) on any chosen route, before making their way back to the boat. From there, competitors tackle three more mountains: Mount Steinhouse (353m) on Lamma, Violet Hill (433m) on Hong Kong Island and Ma On Shan (702m) in Sai Kung. The minimum crew is five, with at least two runners climbing each peak.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fat Choy Run</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: January 30, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: The Peak, Hong Kong Island?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: an 8km road run to usher in the new Lunar Year</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: one of the long-running popular events on the local running calendar, the Year of the Rooster will be the 36th edition. Organised by the Hong Kong Ladies Road Runners Club, the figure-of-eight course starts at the Peak Galleria and passes by this tourist landmark two more times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Kowloon and New Territories?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 50 mile (82km) and 50km trail races, back-to-back</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: Hong Kong's newest ultramarathon is an interesting concept that combines a 50-miler, starting at midnight on the Saturday, and a 50km race on the next day. Both courses will be different, with 200 runners given the chance to compete in both - conquering the legendary "Eight Dragons" of Kowloon: Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill and Crow's Nest. The winner of the race will be crowned the "ninth dragon". Organiser Steve Carr of RaceBase Asia says it will be "the hardest and coolest thing you've ever done in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: another new trail ultramarathon offering 35km and 70km options</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: if the environment and sustainability concerns you, you'll find like-minded people at this new event. Organisers The Green Race hold events with the aim of promoting the enjoyment of outdoors sustainably with each person doing his or her part.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: a team relay event with a total distance of 26km</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: this new race has a different format - teams of three runners tackle three different loops A (4km), B (4km) and C (5km). First all three runners complete loop A. Then, any two runners complete B, passing the baton to one runner to do C, passing on to another runner to do A again. Then, any two runners run B again, before all three runners run C together to finish the race.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: a charity trail race for the entire family with 4km and 8km races for adult-child teams on Saturday, as well as 16km and 42km options on Sunday</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: started in 2015, this is a memorial race for Andy Naylor, a Hong Kong policeman who died while competing at the 2012 Ironman triathlon in New York City. The race goes through the scenic Clearwater Bay Country Park, the trails and roads that Naylor trained on. All profits from the race will go towards investing in running programmes for local children; investing in the local adult running scene; and donating money to any family who has lost a loved one in a running-based event or activity. On Saturday, after the family races, a BBQ and party will be held.</span></p>

Then, any two runners complete B, passing the baton to one runner to do C, passing on to another runner to do A again.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wondering what to do on the weekend? With at least 90 different running and multisport races, ranging from one to 173 kilometres long, taking place between now and the end of April next year, there's good reason - whatever your fitness level - to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From road to trail, a leisurely charity walk to speedy competitive runs, an easy loop round the Peak on Hong Kong Island to the challenging Pat Sin Leng ridge in the northeast New Territories, the variety of events is mind-boggling. With trail running alone - arguably the fastest growing sport in Hong Kong in recent years - there are at least 60 events, more than four times than in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are eight races that whet our appetite for running.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lamma 8</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: November 12</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Tai Wan To Beach, Yung Shue Wan, Lamma Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 8km run with a mix of concrete and trail</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: a charity run organised by the Child Welfare Scheme, a local charity that supports disadvantaged children and their families, this is the first event of its kind on Lamma. The route goes past the Lamma wind turbine and a scenic mountain trail, before looping back to the start. It's an easy hike for beginners and can be a challenge for runners racing against the clock. The race ends with a beach music festival featuring local bands, food and drinks, market stalls, beach games and children's activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">cwshk.org/NewsandEvents/Lamma8.aspx?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSIG 50 Series - Lantau Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: December 4</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Lantau Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 16km, 27km and 50km trail run</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: rub shoulders with some of the region's and world's best trail runners, such as Ultra Trail Mont Blanc champions Caroline Chaverot and Ludovic Pommeret of France in this event that doubles up as the Asian Skyrunning Championships. The race is part of the MSIG 50 Series, which also includes an event on Hong Kong Island (Oct 23) and Sai Kung (Feb 18). The 16km route covers no major peaks, unlike the longer routes, and has a generous six-hour cut-off - ideal if you're just getting started in trail running.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aberdeen Boat Club &amp; Beneteau Four Peaks Race</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: January 21 to January 22, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: all around Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: Asia's ultimate sailing and hill running challenge that covers between 55 to 90 nautical miles (101km to 167km).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: an annual overnight multisport race organised by the Aberdeen Boat Club since 1985, the race brings together the sailing and running community for an endurance feat which takes on average 24 hours to complete. Typically, competitors set off from Tai Tam Bay on the Saturday morning, sailing towards Lantau. There, runners are dropped off in an allocated zone and travel to shore via a small boat or kayak and ascend Lantau Peak (934 metres) on any chosen route, before making their way back to the boat. From there, competitors tackle three more mountains: Mount Steinhouse (353m) on Lamma, Violet Hill (433m) on Hong Kong Island and Ma On Shan (702m) in Sai Kung. The minimum crew is five, with at least two runners climbing each peak.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: January 30, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: The Peak, Hong Kong Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: an 8km road run to usher in the new Lunar Year</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: one of the long-running popular events on the local running calendar, the Year of the Rooster will be the 36th edition. Organised by the Hong Kong Ladies Road Runners Club, the figure-of-eight course starts at the Peak Galleria and passes by this tourist landmark two more times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: February 4 to February 5, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Kowloon and New Territories</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 50 mile (82km) and 50km trail races, back-to-back</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: Hong Kong's newest ultramarathon is an interesting concept that combines a 50-miler, starting at midnight on the Saturday, and a 50km race on the next day. Both courses will be different, with 200 runners given the chance to compete in both - conquering the legendary "Eight Dragons" of Kowloon: Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill and Crow's Nest. The winner of the race will be crowned the "ninth dragon". Organiser Steve Carr of RaceBase Asia says it will be "the hardest and coolest thing you've ever done in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frankie Lor Fu-chuen's first campaign may be the racing story of the season so far but as much as we want the affable trainer to emulate his mentor John Size and challenge for the championship in year one, he needs to change one key statistic to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For all of Lor's success with the second-hand junk cars he has transformed into Ferraris, he is yet to win with one straight from the showroom floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than half of Lor's 30 wins so far have been in Class Five and while his strike rate in the grade is an extraordinary 43 per cent (16 of 37), these horses can be seen as hand outs to a new trainer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those Class Five wins have come from horses that were clearly under-valued by the handicapper or under-trained by previous handlers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The theory goes that after the Lor polish they have been able to rise close to their correct level in the ratings, he hasn't actually improved them as such, just trained them better. Or, to be more kind to the previous trainers, Lor received them right at the point at which they were going to turn things around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lor has been a revelation, but with around 40 per cent of the season gone there are still a few gaps that need feeling on his resume, the most obvious being the lack of wins with new horses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A grand total of one win - the aptly named New Elegance on December 17 - has come from his horses that hadn't had a previous start with another stable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rattling off wins with stable transfers is a great way for a first year trainer to make a name for himself, but it isn't uncommon either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Back in 2011-12 transfer turnarounds formed the backbone of a solid season for a rookie named Richard Gibson.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Englishman trained 35 winners in his first season, but all but four of them were transfers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's no surprise that the new guy gets the horses nobody else wants, it's not as if a new trainer has many other options early on, as he waits for horses he has sourced himself to acclimatise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And desiring diversity, the Hong Kong Racehorse Owners Association and club officials are no doubt keen for the freshmen handlers to hit the ground running, so steer connections towards the new stables.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the cautionary tale for Lor and those trumpeting him as a future championship contender (yes, hands up, this column pleads guilty on that charge) was what happened next for Gibson.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2011-12 was meant to be the foundation for an upward rise through the ranks for Gibson, and although he has had his fair share of big race success, he hasn't trained as many winners in a single season since.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And just as Gibson turned around transfers like Easy Gold (five wins, 37 points), Great Renown (three wins, up 24 points), Super Caga (four wins, 29 points), Zezao (three wins, 28 points) and Kung Hei Fat Choi (two wins, 14 points) - all but one of whom started in Class Five - the bulk of Lor's success so far has come from picking up somebody else's problems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another similarity between the initial success of Gibson and Lor is that they have both benefited from the retirement of an under-performing veteran local trainer prior to their arrival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Easy Gold, Great Renown and Kung Hei Fat Choi all found a home with Gibson after dropping like a stone in the ratings under the care of Alex Wong Yu-on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just as Gibson put the polish on Wong's rejects, Lor has scooped on some key recruits out of the Gary Ng Ting-keung fire sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yourthewonforme (three wins), Diamond Friends (three) and Furious Pegasus (two wins) all come from Ng's yard and the trio might have more wins in them yet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another challenge for Lor will be when to let go of his Class Five projects. Gibson clung on to too many of his multiple winners. Easy Gold, Great Renown, Zezao, Super Caga and Kung Hei Fat Choi were still with the stable at the start of the following season but none of them were able to win again for the trainer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Letting go is hard to do, but Lor will need to be tough-minded and not waste too much time with horses that have reached their ratings peaks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is nothing wrong with winning a trainer succeeding with stable transfers, after all it was a high profile stable move to Size that sparked arguably the greatest training career in Hong Kong racing history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Electronic Unicorn's early season shift from Ricky Yiu Poon-fai to Size - capped by a dominant first-up victory with top weight in the Panasonic Cup - elevated the Australian to mythological status, he was now the man with the </span><span class="s3">Midas</span><span class="s1"> touch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Size was soon the undisputed God of Hong Kong racing; he won not only that championship, but three in a row and nine from 16 in total (ten if you count a tie with Caspar Fownes in 2013-14, which the club should add retrospectively).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Lor is the local Messiah we want him to be he is going to need to do more than turn transfers around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private Purchase Griffins, horses that arrive in Hong Kong with no prior racing experience, have been Size's specialty and Lor gets a chance to break through with his first PPG wins this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We shouldn't rush to peg this season's rookie of the year as the next Size, or another Richard Gibson - it's still early days - but if talented PPG's Super Missile and Have Fun Together can breakthrough on New Year's Day it will open up a new level of possibilities for Lor.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, China's biggest online health care platform, said on Thursday that losses narrowed by 2.6 per cent in the first half of the year, helped by strong growth in the number of users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its first earnings report since going public in May, the company, officially known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, reported a net loss of 444.2 million yuan (US$64 million) for the first six months, while revenue jumped 150 per cent to 1.1 billion yuan from the year-earlier period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mobile app Ping An Good Doctor had 228 million registered user by the end of June, up 19 per cent from the end of last year. Monthly active users, who tapped on the app for online medical and wellness consultation services, reached 48.6 million, climbing 51 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its aggressive expansion into new markets and offline businesses, Good Doctor has set up a US$120 million joint venture with ride-hailing platform Grab to enter Southeast Asia and fully acquired Wanjia HealthCare, a former unit of Ping An Group that runs a network of private clinics across China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will increase cooperation with internet companies and insurers to lift profit margin and control costs,” said Wang Tao, chairman and chief executive of Good Doctor.We will increase cooperation with internet companies and insurers to lift profit margin and control costsWang Tao, Ping An Good Doctor</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spun off from </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, China's biggest insurer by market value, Good Doctor was the first technology unicorn, a start-up valued at over US$1 billion, listed in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It raised US$1.1 billion from the most sought-after initial public offering in Hong Kong since 2009, with the retail tranche of the offer oversubscribed by 654 times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flotation came amid high anticipation for technology IPOs following the stock exchange's listing rules reform in April to capitalise on China's technology boom over the past decade.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor priced its offering at the top end of the HK$50.80 to HK$54.80 range, but the stock has fallen 22 per cent below the IPO price. It closed 2.3 per cent down at HK$42.50 on Thursday, before the earnings were announced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company suffered a net loss of 1 billion yuan in 2017, its third straight year of annual losses.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest supplier of business management software, and Alibaba Cloud (AliCloud), a subsidiary of e-commerce powerhouse </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, plans to jointly launch a new range of online solutions designed to ramp up cloud computing adoption by enterprises across mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We see our key to success in China is increasing penetration of our cloud solutions into small and medium-sized enterprises,” Edward Chen, the chief business officer at SAP Greater China, said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The launch follows </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"> and AliCloud's strategic partnership, which was announced at an event in Shenzhen in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cloud computing enables companies to buy, sell, lease or distribute online a range of software and other digital resources as an on-demand service, just like electricity from a power grid. These resources are managed inside data centres. “Cloud” refers to the internet as depicted in computer network diagrams.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simon Hu Xiaoming, the president of AliCloud, said in April the strategic alliance with </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">German software giant </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"> has about 11,000 corporate customers, many of them large enterprises, across the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. A growing number of those clients are cloud users, it said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"> has been stepping up efforts to get more of its 320,000 customers in 190 countries to adopt its latest S/4 Hana suite of financial and operational planning software, which is a cloud solution available for subscription.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1">, AliCloud will jointly market and help deploy its Hana One and other “software-as-a-service” solutions on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou-based AliCloud, which was founded in 2009, is the mainland's largest cloud infrastructure services provider, with more than 2.3 million domestic clients as of March 31. These users include companies in the finance, transportation, genomics, medical and meteorological sectors, according to Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Morgan Stanley equity analyst Robert Lin said in a report that AliCloud had 500,000 paying clients, including half of the top 35 Chinese “unicorn” internet companies - start-up firms with a US$1 billion valuation as determined by public or private investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin said AliCloud started making its broad product offerings commercially available in 2014, “implying ample revenue growth opportunity”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's public cloud service market appears primed for rapid growth, with research firm Forrester predicting that it will reach US$3.8 billion by 2020, up from an estimated US$1.8 billion last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of China's biggest buyers of global assets, Fosun has kept its buying spree going this year even though a national crackdown on “irrational” overseas acquisitions has left most of its peers busy offloading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe our investments in the US will still be welcome, and we have seen more investment opportunities in Europe,” billionaire tycoon Guo Guangchang, who co-founded the company, told a press conference.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">India and countries in Africa were also welcoming Fosun's technology and investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo said he “trusted the wisdom of the Chinese and US leadership” to resolve their trade conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai-based Fosun owns the French holiday resort chain </span><span class="s3">Club Med</span><span class="s1">, and 25 per cent of the world's largest theatrical producer, Cirque du Soleil.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has acquired a number of overseas assets this year, including stakes in European fashion brands Lanvin and Wolford, despite coming under intense scrutiny from the government as it cracked down on debt-fuelled foreign shopping sprees by Chinese conglomerates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firms including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> found themselves under the regulatory spotlight and have been busy offloading overseas assets to comply with Beijing's guidelines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Fosun plans to spin off more business segments and list them in Hong Kong. It recently received approval from the bourse operator to float its Fosun Tourism and Culture Group unit, and has filed for an initial public offering for online parenting firm, Babytree Group, in which it owns a 25 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope we will present more unicorn-style, high-growth businesses to the capital market in Hong Kong and elsewhere,” said Chen Qiyu, executive director and co-president of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's market had become more attractive since the stock exchange reformed its listing rules to accommodate technology and biopharma firms, Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo and Chen were speaking after Fosun posted a 17 per cent rise in first-half profit on the back of strong growth in its health care, tourism and fashion segments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net profit rose to 6.9 billion yuan (US$1 billion) for the first six months of this year from 5.9 billion yuan in the same period of 2017, while revenue was up 20 per cent to 43.5 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the firm had fallen 1.5 per cent to HK$14.32 as of 1:10pm on Wednesday after the results announcement.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multiple classes of shares among their shareholders may be allowed to raise capital in Hong Kong by the middle of 2018, as the city's Securities&amp;Futures Commission (SFC) backs away from its position on the "One Share, One Vote" principle, which has been a pillar of the local capital market since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A pilot scheme will be launched next year, whereby certain start-up companies that have attained the so-called unicorn status - valuations exceeding US$1 billion - will be allowed to raise capital on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange through initial public offerings, if they put in place sufficient investor protection provisions, two sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The protection provisions may include a sunset clause that compels the companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stocks listed under this pilot programme will also need to be designated with a special code to distinguish them from other listed companies, for reminding investors to be aware of potential risks, the source said. The pilot plan could be widened if sufficient number of high-quality companies are attracted to Hong Kong without regulatory problems, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's about-turn is a major step forward in helping Hong Kong compete with global capital markets including New York, Singapore and Shanghai, especially in attracting technology and new economy companies to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for companies to raise funds this year, falling behind New York and Shanghai. Between January and June, the city's stock market raised US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, a drop of 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised in the same period in 2016, when it was ranked as the leader for new listings worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> pushed for a consultation to launch dual-class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections by the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the SFC in 2014 opposed exemption for </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, to list in Hong Kong. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source said the SFC was supporting Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who in August signalled the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC and the government also want to see dual-class shares listed on the main board instead of a proposed separate board, as they do not want to see a fragmented market structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange is likely to announce the pilot scheme in the coming weeks, the second source said. It will hold a second round of detailed rule changes for this pilot scheme before dual-class shares can be listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The head of a start-up accelerator in Taiwan that is backed by the nation's government believes her team can change the playing field by leveraging the island's unique advantages in terms of design and quality of hardware.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anita Huang, a former regional executive for US technology giants </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, was appointed the head of Taiwan Startup Stadium (TSS) earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accelerator is funded by the National Development Council (NDC), a government branch of the Executive Yuan, or Taiwan's cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang has two key missions: putting Taiwan's start-ups on the world map, and finding a way to attract start-ups from other countries to do business with the island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The TSS was only launched a few months but it has already generated plenty of buzz among the international start-up community, for example by aggressively promoting local start-ups at a high-profile event in the US last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new body has also attracted the attention of foreign companies by promoting Taiwan as a destination for hardware sourcing and manufacturing, after growing concerns about product quality in Shenzhen, which lies just across the border from Hong Kong but in some ways is a world apart.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you want to compare price [with Shenzhen], we can't beat China,” Huang said on the sidelines of a </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">-sponsored event in Taipei focusing on start-ups and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yes, you can find cheaper stuff in Shenzhen, where prototypes can typically be manufactured at a very fast speed,” she said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But if you think twice and consider the excellence in product design and manufacturing quality, many clients actually come back to Taiwan for business after trying Shenzhen.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen has served as the home base for a number of Chinese technology giants including internet portal and real-time messaging service leader Tencent, as well as the two biggest manufacturers of telecoms equipment on the mainland, namely Huawei and ZTE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">DJI, which controls about 70 per cent of global market for civilian drones, is also headquartered in this industrial but sun-stroked city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology start-ups from Europe and the US have chosen Shenzhen as the production base for their early prototypes because of its extensive supply chains, clusters of manufacturing vendors, cheap labour costs and proximity to the giant Chinese market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They often head here first because it is a cheap and effective way to get demonstration products made before they head out to court venture capital investors and pitch for funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But while this special economic zone endorsed by late leader Deng Xiaoping has maintained its reputation as a world factory for three decades, inflation and labour costs have shot up in recent years to erode its competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also facing challenges related to intellectual property rights as some of the Chinese tech companies that originated there have been dubbed clones of advanced products originating in the West.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In some cases, high-quality counterfeits of iconic tech products can be purchased in Shenzhen even before they are officially released on the Chinese mainland or in other markets. A case in point would be the recently released iPhone 6S.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just this week, local media in Shenzhen reported that several factories in the Pearl River Delta, including a mobile phone plant belonging to Jingchi Plastics in the Fenggang township of Dongguan, were shut down immediately after China took a week off to celebrate its national day.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This further stoked concerns that electronics manufacturers in the region, in which Shenzhen always plays a leading role, have been losing out to their foreign rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spate of shutdowns followed a drop in demand for exports of electronic information products like trendy wearables and other gadgets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, rising costs at factories in Guangdong are prompting companies from Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere to withdraw from the province and relocate to cheaper neighbouring countries like Vietnam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Huang, this translates as a golden opportunity for Taiwan to grab more international clients as the island is well-known for its talent pool of programmers and engineers, as well as its hardware production capacities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang related the story of how one non-Chinese maker of electronic devices travelled to Shenzhen first to get some prototypes made but was disillusioned after the local vendor failed to deliver the required quality. In frustration, the client quit the city and headed to Taiwan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang said Shenzhen can still lean on its formidable reputation, but no one knows for exactly how long.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Shenzhen still has a lot of advantages, especially in terms of manufacturing scale, and it already has a good reputation, as many people already know what Shenzhen can do when it comes to technology manufacturing,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said manufacturing speed was one area where Taiwan is racing to catch up, but that it must do so without sacrificing either quality or its competitive prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TSS has worked with more than 100 homegrown start-ups and partnered with dozens global tech leaders including </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, which chose Taiwan as the location for its regional data centre, to help them expand beyond the island into Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Huang led a group of 30 people, including representatives from a dozen Taiwan start-ups, to join the highly influential TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her team also used the event to pitch the idea of doing business in Taiwan to a number of European and US start-ups, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eventually we hope there will be some unicorn companies born in Taiwan, so we can put more Taiwanese start-ups on the world map,” she said, referring to a popular investment industry term for a start-up whose valuation has risen above US$1 billion even before it goes public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recent examples of unicorns include Xiaomi, often known as the “Apple of China”, and Uber, the San Francisco-based car-hailing app that has transformed the way people move around big cities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Hong Kong Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung has joined WeLab Virtual Bank, which has applied for a licence in the city, as chairman, he said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan joined WeLab, the virtual bank's parent company, as a senior adviser in July, his first appointment since leaving the government in July 2017. WeLab, an online lender, serves more than 30 million customers in Hong Kong and mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial technology company, a home-grown Hong Kong unicorn, is also among the first batch of 29 applicants for virtual banking licences, which will be issued by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, the city's de facto central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a home-grown fintech company, which has a sound risk-management system. It has invested in technology and security measures to provide innovative banking services to customers. As I am confident about the future of the company, I have agreed to take up the chairman's role,” Chan told the media on Tuesday. He will, however, “only act as non-executive chairman”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is a very positive move for the HKMA to introduce virtual banking this year, as well as its Faster Payment System this week. These are very important measures for Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab co-founder Simon Loong was present for the announcement. A former banker with </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">, Loong help set up WeLab five years ago with a money lender's licence in Hong Kong, and has since teamed up with mainland Chinese partners to allow customers to apply for loans through the internet or smartphones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are targeting younger customers who are between 20 and 35 years old, who are not the traditional banks' target clients. Many traditional banks focus on clients who are over 40 or 50 years old, as they borrow larger sums of money. We believe by adopting technology, we can offer small loans but can still make a profit. We want to target tech-savvy customers,” said Loong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 70 per cent of the fintech company's customers are between 20 to 40 years old, while customers in this age group account for only 30 per cent of the clientele at traditional banks, Loong added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to the use of technology such as chatbots and facial recognition, WeLab only needs 700 employees in Hong Kong and mainland China to served its 30 million customers. “Our customers have increased by eight times over the past two years, but our staff has only increased by 1.8 times,” said Loong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, the company applied to list on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange. There was some speculation in the market that it would raise US$500 million, but Loong declined to comment on the matter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Chinese tech start-up listed in Hong Kong released a profit warning on Monday, joining a wave of once-promising mainland internet and tech start-ups that have faced difficulties in their operations recently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Feiyu Technology International Company</span><span class="s1">, a Chinese mobile and web games developer, informed its shareholders and potential investors on its website that it may record a net loss of approximately 75 million to 85 million yuan for the six months ended June 30, 2016 under the International Financial Reporting Standards as compared to a net profit of 92 million yuan for the corresponding period in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following the announcement, Feiyu's share price dropped from HK$1.63 in early trading on Monday to HK$1.4 on Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Feiyu went public in Hong Kong in December 2014, one year after it was set up in Xiamen in Fujian province, on the back of its success in developing several popular mobile games, including Carrot Fantasy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its statement, Feiyu explained that the expected net loss was due to the delay in launching key new games and a decrease in revenue of the group's existing games as they reached mature stages of their product life cycles, as well as a significant increase in administrative expenses and research and development costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Feiyu saw annual revenue of 322 million yuan with net profit of 200 million yuan, according to mainland media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company expected to launch six new games this year but so far has only launched one game on the Tencent platform, released on June 13.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, ShenqiBuy.com, another high-profile e-commerce company founded by 17-year-old Wang Kaixin, China's youngest internet tycoon, reportedly laid off half of its employees and moved the office, mainland media reports have said since Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ShenqiBuy, or MagicBuy in English, targeted the post-1995 generation of young Chinese and has attracted huge attention across the country since it was set up last year by a 17-year-old high school dropout.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In January this year, Wang successfully landed 20 million yuan in A round fundraising from several domestic investors only three months after the launch of her app, and after appearing on the Beijing TV programme I am Unicorn, which helps start-ups lure venture capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the Chinese public has begun to have doubts about Shenqibuy since May when international monthly magazine GQ revealed that the company was faking the number of users and average daily orders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of February, more than 800 mainland Chinese online to offline (O2O) companies that landed A Series financing in 2014 had burned through their investments and had been shuttered, according to the government-run Guangzhou Daily.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's technology sector is in a bubble - but not the kind that erases huge fortunes when it bursts. This bubble, imposed by the Chinese authorities in Beijing in the form of the censored, closed internet also known as the Great Firewall, has stymied efforts by the world's second-largest economy to create truly innovative breakthroughs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Various commentators of late have written about how China has "won" against Silicon Valley or has caught up with it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They cite the rapid growth of BAT - </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1">, Alibaba Group Holdings and Tencent Inc - and their innovations in e-commerce, mobile payments, social network and instant messaging as evidence of China's innovation prowess[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2080409/how-innovative-china-beating-facebook-google-and-amazon]. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What they often don't mention is that BAT were born, survived and thrived in a protected market, which is the other aspect of the bubble. It keeps competitors out, as well restricting the free flow of information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shielded from competition from the American tech innovators they original copied, and with a home market of 1.35 billion people, BAT and newer Chinese web startups have been able to grow rapidly on[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2095721/why-chinese-web-users-will-pay-content-westerners-wont-and-apps-content] the mainland and come up with innovations that have evolved out of the closed Chinese internet environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recent examples include live streaming companies, and so-called knowledge payment services that offer online comedy, investing tips, beauty advice for a fee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have attracted venture capital funding on the basis of their millions of paying subscribers. But very few of these business models are exportable outside of China. All this content is available for free on </span><span class="s3">YouTube</span><span class="s1">, which is banned in China. If that ban was ever lifted, these start-ups would find their business models severely disrupted overnight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for BAT, they have largely been unable to make inroads outside China, other than being listed on stock markets in the US or in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ancient Chinese scientists gave the world paper currency, the compass, gunpowder and moveable type printing. What inventions of similar importance have emerged from China since the country embarked on its economic transformation three decades ago? Nothing comes to mind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compare the inventions of antiquity with the major tech milestones of the past 50 years: mobile phones in the 70s, personal computers in the 80s, the internet and web search in the 90s, and smartphones and social media after 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is doubtful any of these US tech breakthroughs would have happened without free market competition, and an open information environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world is overdue for another game changing technology, one that should come from China given its near unlimited manpower and financial muscle. But with the free flow of ideas hampered by strict censorship laws designed to maintain social harmony and keep the ruling Communist Party in power, the odds are stacked against it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under Xi Jinping's rule, China's internet controls have tightened and scientists and academics complain they can't access overseas research, hampering their work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the parliamentary meetings in March, some delegates proposed an easing of the restrictions[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2078350/chinas-internet-censorship-under-fire-two-sessions] - but ironically one proposal was censored and the other went unreported on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What about the next generation of Chinese tech firms: could a game changing innovation emerge from this group, which includes scores of of so-called unicorns, or private firms valued at over US$1 billion?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China accounts for a fifth of the world's unicorns, while the US has 55 per cent, according to CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's biggest unicorn is </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies Inc</span><span class="s1">, with a valuation of US$68 billion, followed by China's Xiaomi at US$46 billion, and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> - the dominant Chinese ride-sharing company that bought out Uber's China business - at US$34 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi started in 2010 as an iPhone copycat while Didi drove the company it copied out of China after it got a US$1 billion investment from Apple.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Xiaomi's phones have become commodities and Didi is, as one tech commentator put it, an "illegal cab company with a slick smartphone app."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To their credit, Didi and Xiaomi recognise the limitations of their current copycat business models and are investing in research and development, with Didi targeting artificial intelligence, which is also a focus of BAT.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The newest crop of Chinese unicorns includes Ofo[http://www.scmp.com/tech/leaders-founders/article/2088427/chinese-bike-sharing-start-says-its-now-worth-more-us2-billion], one of many so-called "Uber-for-bicycle" companies that are attracting venture capital investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While they satisfy a need for convenience and environmentally friendly "last mile" transportation, it's hard to see these companies as the vanguard of the next game-changing technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Billion dollar valuations for companies with little in the way of intellectual capital is reminiscent of Silicon Valley's dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when flimsy start-ups like online grocer Webvan saw their valuations soar to billions of dollars after their initial stock offers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Silicon Valley dot-com bubble burst in spectacular fashion soon after - but out of the rubble came many of the tech advances that have changed people's lives over the past 15 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maybe China is in a tech bubble after all - the type that overvalues companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But before the country can come up with the next truly game changing technology, both bubbles will need to burst.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size has dipped his toe back in the Group One pond over the past year after a drought, but even his stunning upset with It Has To Be You has failed to ignite any serious optimism about Fay Fay's prospects in the HK$8 million Citibank Hong Kong Gold Cup on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At 125-1, It Has To Be you threw out his credentials to follow Fay Fay's 2012 win and be Size's second Hong Kong Derby winner. Added to Glorious Days' Stewards' Cup victory in January, he gave the trainer a third Group One in the last 12 months following a three-year absence from that elite circle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size said yesterday it wasn't something he lay awake at night worrying about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Of course, it's nice to win them but first you need the horse. I'll cop it sweet when those horses come along but I'd go crazy worrying about how many Group Ones I'm winning here," he said. "It isn't like Australia, where there are many, many Group Ones in half a dozen different states and if you look hard enough you can travel to find a race you can win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In Hong Kong, you always have one or two horses who dominate each distance range and you can't escape. Every time you turn up for a Group One, they are there, and you can't beat them." In Hong Kong, you always have one or two horses who dominate each distance range and you can't escape. Every time you turn up for a Group One, they are there, and you can't beat them</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's something Size went through with Electronic Unicorn when he was the dominant miler and on the flipside with Sight Winner, who won a surprise 2009 Champions Mile then spent 21/2 years marooned on a high mark and finishing within three lengths of Good Ba Ba, Able One and Beauty Flash, but unable to win. And now Size is a realist where Fay Fay is concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I thought he was, at best, an average Derby winner last year, winning off a 110 rating and nothing special and I thought he'd struggle after," Size said.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> . said it'll go on a hiring spree over the next three years, as it reorganises its China investment banking team into additional categories to serve so-called new economy companies that are expected to raise up to US$200 billion in capital over the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new economy in China is newer than, and very different from, many economies in the West,” said the bank's co-head of Asia-Pacific investment banking Murli Maiya, aiming to turn the team into a “tech-everything” organisation. “In three to four years, our bankers would be obsolete, as our clients change in a way they can't understand, so we have to force the change here. ”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hiring also forms part of its plan to build a securities business onshore in China, once it is approved by local regulators. In May, the bank applied for approval to set up a majority-owned securities company in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reorganisation of its China team, which began earlier this month, will expand its workforce by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent, while dividing the current structure into seven new sectors, comprising financial services and technology, health care and technology, enterprise and technology services, new mobility, lifestyle and smart manufacturing, digital access, and infrastructure and commodities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the heart of China's techno-nationalism is a hit list of 200 unicorns [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139684/heart-chinas-techno-nationalism-hit-list-200-unicorns]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reorganisation coincides with the overhaul that Hong Kong's stock market operator and securities regulator pushed through last year, changing the city's listing regulations to allow biotechnology research teams and technology start-ups to raise capital in the city. In a survey conducted by PwC, most Chinese unicorns said they prefer to raise funds in Hong Kong, more so than in New York and Shanghai or Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also aligns with a liberalisation in China's ownership rules, which allows banks like </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> to own up to 51 per cent share in their onshore operations, a structure which may eventually lead to wholly foreign-owned operations [http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2145181/bring-trade-tension-down-notch-and-talk-says-jpmorgan-chief] in Asia's largest capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland, home to more than 160 unicorns, or start-ups with at least US$1 billion in valuation, is the main reason the bank is retooling its China team. The bank expects these unicorns to need to raise about US$200 billion through initial public offerings and private market placements in the next three years, said the bank's China investment banking head Houston Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The old industry structure has become increasingly inefficient to cope with our business needs in China's changing economic dynamics,” Huang said, adding that he wants the team to have a “tech DNA.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is a leading player in the world unicorn race and the speed of growth is unprecedented, so we have to find a way to better serve the growing number of clients representing China's new economy,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that they will hire more graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, which are considered the key to China's economic future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maiya said the new approach in China could potentially disrupt the 200-year tradition of Wall Street investment banking practise and set a test case for the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Everywhere in the world, people are looking at what we do in China, because they want to see what's happening. It could be a template of what we do in banking,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Xin, one of the pioneers of China's online video-streaming market, looks to be in search of a second act as he shared his views on artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and other topics in technology following his release from prison on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The controversial Chinese internet entrepreneur was handed a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence and fined 1 million yuan (US$159 million) in 2016 by the Beijing Haidian District People's Court, which found him guilty of “distributing obscene materials for personal gain” as his online business provided easy access to pornography and various pirated content.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separate posts by family and friends on </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> suggested that a comeback could be in store for the 38-year-old Wang, who discussed his views on the latest trends in China's red-hot technology market at a dinner after his release.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I firmly believe that in the near future there will be another legendary story of master Wang,” said He Xiaopeng, the co-founder and chairman of electric car start-up Xiaopeng Motors, in a </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> post on Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He described Wang as being “in good health and synchronised mind like us” as the newly freed entrepreneur discussed various hi-tech developments, such as AI, video streaming and blockchain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, He posted group photos with Wang alongside David Li Xueling, the co-founder and chairman of video-based social network YY, and Michael Yao Jinbo, the chairman and chief executive of Chinese online classifieds platform operator </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He subsequently deleted that post and photos from his </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> account. Neither Wang nor YY's Li could be reached for comment on Thursday. Xiaopeng's He did not reply to an inquiry made via </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, while calls made to </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">'s Yao were not answered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Wang's business reputation will need rehabilitation after his conviction and stint in prison, he will find a market that is fostering the development of a growing number of technology start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's hi-tech boom has minted a new generation of billionaires who are involved in fields like online shopping, mobile gaming or AI rather than property development or traditional financial services.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has also encouraged increased entrepreneurship to ensure enough jobs for the world's most populous nation, while steering the economy away from the old, foreign investment-led manufacturing model to one that is grounded in innovative, internet-related technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a trend that supports advanced automation through such hi-tech developments as the internet of things, big data analytics, cloud computing and AI.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's vast population of internet users have also helped to foster a unique environment where start-ups can enjoy huge success in an unusually short period of time[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111049/china-takes-gold-race-develop-billion-dollar-start-unicorns], according to a joint study published in September last year by </span><span class="s3">Boston Consulting Group</span><span class="s1">, Baidu, </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang, a graduate of the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, founded Shenzhen-based online video service Qvod Technology Co in 2007 after working at </span><span class="s3">Shanda Interactive Entertainment</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qvod gained notoriety for peer-to-peer video-streaming platform called Kuaibo, which allowed users to watch mostly pirated video and pornography, as well as a popular desktop video-editing software.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By 2011, Qvod had a reported 80 per cent share of the video-streaming market in China and about 500 million users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November 2013, a coalition of the country's biggest online video providers - including </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Youku Tudou</span><span class="s1"> and Sohu - sued Qvod for unauthorised video sharing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When police started investigating Wang later that year for repeated violations of copyright law and for spreading pornography online, he fled overseas and was on the run for about 110 days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was apprehended by </span><span class="s3">Interpol</span><span class="s1"> in August 2014 at an unspecified country and repatriated back to the mainland, according to a </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> report at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After Wang was charged in 2015, the police reported that most of the videos found in Qvod's servers were pornographic content.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three other Qvod executives were each handed prison sentences of up to three years and three months, and fined 500,000 yuan each by the Beijing court in 2016. Qvod was fined 10 million yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A report by Global Times, a government-backed newspaper, said Wang showed remorse for his actions during the trial. It quoted him as saying that “faced with the choice between social responsibility and company interests, I chose the latter”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qvod's official website remains live. A post dated January 2017 on its homepage said the company has not released any new video-streaming players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a post dated January 27 this year, the </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> account owned by Wang's wife, who has more than 160,000 followers, thanked Wang's supporters ahead of his release.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It received almost 2,400 comments, with the top-voted commenter stating his belief that Wang “will stage a comeback in business”. Wang's wife did not respond to inquiries made via Weibo.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore consumers eagerly awaiting a price war to erupt between ride-hailing giant Grab and Indonesian rival Go-Jek, which is poised to enter the city next month, should not hold their breath.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab plans to take a cautious approach and push to further improve its services, rather than drive up subsidies, as competition with Go-Jek intensifies in its home market and across Southeast Asia, company president Ming Maa said in an interview at the China Conference organised by the South China Morning Post in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not believe that winning customer heartshare and mindshare is driven by subsidies,” he said. "It's driven by providing them good service and a good product.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 41-year-old Maa, who joined Grab two years ago from Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Group Corp</span><span class="s1">, said the Singapore-based company spends significantly less on subsidies "by a very, very wide margin”, citing its track record against </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> before their merger in March this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Singapore, a preview of the clash to come between Grab and Go-Jek [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2149640/singapore-preview-how-grab-and-go-jek-will-likely-face-across-southeast-asia]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa's comments come after Grab and Uber were slapped a combined S$13 million (US$9.4 million) fine last month by Singapore's antitrust watchdog for anti-competitive behaviour as a result of their merger, which had effectively made Grab the city state's dominant ride-hailing player with about 80 per cent market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore found that Grab's exclusivity deals with taxi companies, car rental partners and even some drivers had hampered other ride-hailing players from expanding in the city state, while prices for Grab services increased. So apart from the financial penalty, the commission instructed Grab to dismantle its exclusive partner arrangements as well as restore its pre-merger pricing algorithms and commission rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expansion of Go-Jek in Singapore would make the city state its second international market after launching in Vietnam last month. Go-Jek has been in talks with Comfort-Delgro, Singapore's largest taxi operator that previously had an exclusive deal with Uber, according to a report by news site TechCrunch earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa dismissed concerns that Go-Jek's imminent arrival in Singapore would adversely affect Grab's business in its home market, saying that Grab "loves competition”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab, founded by Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling, is currently Southeast Asia's most valuable tech start-up, with </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, Uber and SoftBank among its major shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Competition is good for the industry, it makes us stronger and helps us develop better products and services,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How Grab's CEO steered it from a garage in Malaysia to Southeast Asia's most valuable tech unicorn [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2157177/how-grabs-ceo-steered-it-garage-malaysia-southeast-asias-most-valuable-tech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We've been blessed to be able to compete with the best of the best - Uber. That experience taught us a lot.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab may need to fall back on that experience as it is locked in a heated battle for market share across Southeast Asia with Go-Jek.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jakarta-based Go-Jek, founded by Nadiem Makarim, started as a motorcycle ride-hailing service in 2010 in Indonesia, but it now offers everything from meal deliveries to over-the-counter medicine and massage services on-demand through its super app. The company earlier this year announced plans to expand into Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines to challenge Grab's dominance in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Go-Jek and Grab are also building up their war chests to help drive their respective expansion programmes in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek steps up rivalry with Grab as it expands in Southeast Asia [https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2152604/indonesias-go-jek-sees-lot-experimentation-it-expands-fight-grab]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek aims to raise about US$2 billion from a new funding round with its existing investors, according to a Reuters report last month that cited unnamed sources. Those backers include </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Warburg Pincus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa said Grab is on track to raise US$3 billion from investors that include SoftBank, </span><span class="s3">Toyota Motor Corp</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Microsoft</span><span class="s1"> by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When you look at our competition, many of them take short cuts because they're chasing after metrics to show how fast they're growing … One such short cut is fraud,” Maa said. "These types of short cuts are tempting to do, but we do not do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Without elaborating, he said some of Grab's rivals have up to 50 per cent fraud on their platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Grab has come under fire for raising fares and reducing promotions, following its merger with Uber's Southeast Asian operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab was also hit by a backlash in July when it announced changes to its loyalty programme, devaluing points earned by users over the year with "immediate effect”. The backlash prompted Grab to postpone certain changes till the end of September, giving users more time to claim rewards at the previous rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a Forrester report released earlier this month, Grab was criticised for changes that appeared "heavy-handed and arrogant”, sparking unhappiness in both customers and drivers alike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Grab triggered an explosive emotional reaction that undermined its market position and spread like a virus,” the report said. It added that the company was not ready to venture into other businesses like payments and food delivery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa acknowledged that Grab could "always do better” in improving its user experience, adding that the firm has a "laser focus” on providing sustainable, safe and reliable services to both its passengers and drivers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has already branched out from ride-hailing to payments, food delivery, logistics and on-demand grocery orders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Thursday, Grab announced a partnership with </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> that could help further engage its users. Grab will offer its 110 million users the option of using either a virtual or physical prepaid </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> issued via its app. The move will give millions of users who are underserved by banks, or are unbanked, with a means to buy products and services online, not just within Grab's ecosystem but at any merchant that accepts </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initiative will be rolled out within the first quarter of the next year in Singapore and the Philippines, with plans to expand it to the rest of Grab's markets by the end of 2019, the company said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A brilliant Brett Prebble ride on the Tony Cruz-trained Mega Champion stole the Happy Valley Clubhouse 20th Anniversary Cup, the in-form Australian navigating a miraculous path from the widest gate into a perfect midfield position on the rails.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A solidly run race helped, as Prebble picked his way through inside runs and narrowly edged out the fast-closing Forgive And Forget late.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Once I saw where he had settled, I was very confident and the race panned out perfectly for him."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prebble has now ridden Mega Champion three times this season - his only rides for Cruz this term - for two wins and a second.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douglas Whyte reclaimed top spot in the Jockeys' Championship and John Size took the outright lead in the trainers' division as Classic Jewellery finally broke through for his second win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Classic Jewellery has been fighting an uphill battle, and developed a reputation as being a touch weak, since an impressive debut victory that gave him a 14-point increase in the handicaps at the start of last term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think he is necessarily stronger than last season, but I think we've got to be careful when we run him, you've just got to take your time with him," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We've had to come to Happy Valley to get the win, and we might have to look to try back here again as the Sha Tin mile might be a bit strong for him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm glad he has had a good win, after he ran such a great debut and never really lived up to it."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weichong Marwing rode a double and snatched the Jockey Challenge with 24 points, winning early in the night with a positive ride on Capital K and then for David Ferraris on track specialist Imperial Rome in the last.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Weichong might not ride the most winners here, but at the end of the day, he rides the most for me," Ferraris said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This horse really loves it at this track, and when you've got a horse like that at Happy Valley, I think you need to keep him here as long as possible."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peter Ho Leung's Capital K has dropped from Class Two to Class Four in 13 starts here and, coming off a brave run when stuck wide, was pushed into prominent spot by Marwing and then ground down the leader, Benefactor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Danny Shum Chap-shing took over Good Looking Watch (Tye Angland) this season and a decent first-up effort for his new handler was followed by a solid trial, and a dominant Class Five victory last night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I thought he ran really well for us last start - we ran into Real Dragon, so you can see he has some quality, and we came here tonight feeling very confident," said Shum, who predicted more victories for the six-year-old.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He'll only get six or seven points for that and will stay in the grade. His weight has gone up 20 pounds, he is eating well, sleeping well and his trackwork is great."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andy Leung Ting-wah chimed in with a winner. Storm Unicorn breaking his local maiden status after 13 unsuccessful starts - a positive, and then patient, ride from Derek Leung Ka-chun getting the five-year-old into a one-off spot from barrier nine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He got in the right spot and then waited and waited, and he didn't go until just the right time," Leung said of his namesake's effort, which saw the rider suspended for two days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I always thought this horse would show his best when he got up to 1,650m."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peter Ng Bik-kuen, along with most other trainers, was away at the Ready to Run Sale in New Zealand, but he recorded a double, with Asmodai (Alvin Ng Ka-chun) and Home With Glory (Howard Cheng Yue-tin).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Rapid Finance</span><span class="s1"> (CRF), the mainland's largest online consumer lending platform, is looking to triple the number of users this year as it looks to create a business on par with a major commercial bank's credit-card division.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zane Wang Zhengyu, founder and chief executive of CRF, told the South China Morning Post that the company would be impervious to the challenges facing other peer-to-peer (P2P) operators on the mainland, and would continue to bolster its micro-credit businesses in accordance with Beijing's financial reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have been trying to nurture the growth of online micro-credit business in China," he said. "High frequency of small-loan borrowings is the key to our success."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CRF, founded in 2010, has 1.2 million borrowers on its platform at present. Wang , however, has set his sights high and wants the firm to have about 3 million borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sino Guarantee, Bank of Shanghai inject fresh capital into online lender China Rapid Finance[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2046226/sino-guarantee-bank-shanghai-inject-fresh-capital-online-lender]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CRF would also continue to augment its capital resources and recently bolstered its finances with a US$70 million funding from a clutch of investors including China United SME Guarantee Corp, known as Sino Guarantee, and Broadline Capital, he added.We have been trying to nurture the growth of online micro-credit business in ChinaZane Wang Zhengyu, founder and chief executive, </span><span class="s3">China Rapid Finance</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the mainland, a commercial bank's credit-card unit normally has 8 million to 10 million cardholders more than half of whom would repay the loans before the credit holiday expires, crimping interest income for credit card issuers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We expect our platform to grow to 10 million borrowers in two to three years so that we can become a giant online micro-credit firm," Wang said. "Our business model will be an ideal example of how China's financial reforms can benefit the masses."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 70 million start-ups and 270 million blue-collar workers are not adequately served by the country's banking system, and often find their requests for business loans and credit cards rejected, according to Ping An Puhui, the micro-credit unit of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese policymakers are looking to revamp the country's financial system by promoting wider and better use of internet technologies to offer small loans to needy people and firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A series of scandals involving fraud and collapses of P2P platforms, however, prompted the regulators to step up policing of the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">P2P companies will have to appoint a commercial bank as a custodian to clear a regulatory review procedure in the coming months, a move that is likely to force hundreds of players into liquidation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a typical case, a P2P operator collects a large sum of funds from the lenders before granting multi-million-yuan loans to developers or manufactures at a lofty interest rates, hugely distorting the definition of peer-to-peer lending.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the CRF platform, a matchmaker for borrower and lenders, loans valued at between several hundred yuan and 100,000 yuan (HK$112,021) are extended to borrowers to support their purchase of consumer goods. CRF charges a service fee ranging from 5 to 10 yuan per transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, more than 6 million loans were facilitated on the CRF platform. Wang expects transactions to cross 30 million this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Loans can't be just a one-off deal," he said. "As borrowers' demand for credit continues to rise, a healthy business with sufficient risk-management is needed to serve the 500 million mainland residents."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CRF currently sports a tag of "unicorn" - unlisted technology firms valued at more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The founder wouldn't disclose details of its further financing plans including the potential listing venue and the targeted fund size in the next round of fund-raising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang, 60, who worked as a senior financial analyst and senior manager at big consumer-credit companies in the US, returned to the mainland in 2001 to help the domestic credit-assessment sector.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size says his four runners are all in great shape for Sunday's important Group Two Premier Bowl at Sha Tin but he isn't take anything for granted despite his numerical advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size saddles up Hong Kong's two top-rated horses, Thewizardofoz and Mr Stunning, in the 1,200m feature, ably assisted by Amazing Kids and D B Pin and the Australian handler has quietly assumed the role of the leading trainer of sprintersover the past 18 months, at least in numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yield has not quite lived up to that yet, with three Group Threes and a Group Two last season, but the Premier Bowl has had significance as a Group One pointer in the past and a guide to the December internationals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Premier Bowl was the race from which Absolute Champion emerged as a star, taking the Hong Kong Sprint next start; Aerovelocity also won the double and Lucky Bubbles was unlucky not to 12 months ago. Even Size's 64-1 winner in 2011, Rich Unicorn, surprised again with a close fourth on international day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm really happy with how all four are going. They are at different stages of their preparations, some have had a race and Thewizardofoz hasn't, but I can't fault them," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rival trainers need to get what they can before John Size kicks into gear[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2114451/rival-trainers-need-get-what-they-can-john-size-kicks-gear]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Mr Stunning looks like he has come on for his first run back, D B Pin has been his usual self and I think Amazing Kids has improved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He wasn't as fit as the others first-up but didn't finish far from them. He didn't catch the eye in the trial since but that's him. He just does what he wants to do and never gives you much of a guide on the dirt, but he is different on race day."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then there's Thewizardofoz, who finished last season with a sensational Group Three win, has had three barrier trials and was actually asked to do something by Joao Moreira last Friday with a sharp mid-trial move before running second to Mr Stunning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joao Moreira sides with John Size for Group Twos as Thewizardofoz and Western Express trial well[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2115226/joao-moreira-sides-john-size-group-twos-thewizardofoz-and-western]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Thewizard is quite a gross horse, he's not skinny. So, even with a few trials, he will be improving with racing," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He did a bit in the trial because I think Joao wanted to get around some slower ones in front of him that weren't taking him anywhere. For his target, I'm leaning towards the Hong Kong Sprint but let's have a look at him in his races and see."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size's armoury of stars will almost all be on show on Sunday, with rising unbeaten talent Nothingilikemore returning after an impressive three-year-old campaign, and the only absentee is dual Group One winner Contentment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fixture in the top mile races for the past two seasons, Contentment resumed poorly with a ninth in the Celebration Cup and Size has backed off him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He seemed a bit tired and listless, which might be a hangover from the trip to the Yasuda Kinen in Japan so I've given him some time off," Size said. "He will be back working again in 10 days and we'll see how he progresses from there."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for nominal Classic Mile favourite Nothingilikemore, Size has no path to that race mapped out: "We have to see what happens in his first-up run because, if he wins, he will be in a different class and, if he doesn't, he'll still be in Class Two, so there's no point programming his next one until we know what he's eligible for.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But he has had a long enough break - it's six months since he ran and that's probably even a bit too long, so I wanted to get him going. I'll be guided by him but he'll probably want a couple of runs before the Classic Mile early next year and, at some point, we'll see if he can run a mile. We don't really know that much about what he can do yet after just four starts."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is likely to be a rash of new technology sector initial public offerings (IPOs) over the next 12 to 18 months, especially by companies already backed by China's technology giants Alibaba and Tencent, following the strong equity market performance this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Research firm CB Insights says that out of the 46 “unicorns” in China, 21 are backed by China's Big Four internet giants, Alibaba, Baidu, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, and Tencent or their affiliates, such as </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A unicorn is a start-up firm valued at more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And it adds that China's tech leaders are still pouring money into venture-capital-backed firms right across Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, for instance, made over 30 investments in venture-capital-backed tech firms in the region between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there are few signs yet that Alibaba or Tencent are in any rush to cash in their investments, buoyant market conditions are driving mainland firms, including those operating in the technology sector, back to the markets for more capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E Zhihuan, chief economist at Bank of China Hong Kong (</span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">) said the signs are good that tech IPOs will pick up strongly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock market sentiment is relatively upbeat, supported by a low interest rate environment and recent inclusion of A shares in MSCI's key emerging markets index,” E said, adding that the slowing of regulatory approval for IPOs in mainland China is also a driver.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market benchmark, the Hang Seng Index, is up 18 per cent in the year so far while the MSCI International World Index has gained 10 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Likely to come to market in coming months are a number of tech IPOs, which are already backed by Alibaba or Tencent:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">●Best, a Chinese logistics company backed by Alibaba, said this week it aims to join the fray against the mainland's five largest express delivery firms by raising up to US$750 million from an IPO in New York, betting an e-commerce boom in China will spur demand for its package delivery services and supply chain technology;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, the first online-only insurer in China, could also be set to list its shares in Hong Kong this year, raising up to US$2 billion. Its major shareholders include Alibaba's financial-services affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which has a 16 per cent stake, as well as Tencent, and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● China Reading, the country's largest online publishing and e-book company, plans to raise up to US$800 million in an IPO, possibly in Hong Kong. The Tencent-backed firm has about 600 million registered readers across its nine reading platforms and about 70 per cent of the company's revenue comes from reading apps and sites;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● Sogou, China's third-biggest search engine, has said it is likely to seek an IPO with a valuation of as much as US$5 billion this year. Backed by Tencent and </span><span class="s3">Sohu.com</span><span class="s1">, its chief executive Wang Xiaochuan told Bloomberg the firm plans to use part of the IPO proceeds to improve search results by investing in artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies; and</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, the online finance arm of Alibaba has said it is likely to seek an IPO, although the venue is still unknown. The company is valued at US$60 billion following its US$4.5 billion fundraising round last year. Jack Ma Yun, Alibaba's founder, said last year that </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> focuses on serving the under banked and unbanked in developing countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the owner of South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, China's largest provider of on-demand services from food-delivery to ride-hailing, trumpeted its ambitions to push deep into mobility by acquiring Mobike, the country's biggest bicycle-sharing firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two companies confirmed the acquisition on Wednesday in a joint statement, saying they would be in a better position to fulfill their mission of making people “eat better and live better”. A person briefed on the terms said </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> is paying US$2.7 billion for Mobike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobike will operate as an independent entity and brand after the takeover. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> CEO Wang Xing will become chairman of the board at Mobike, with Wang Xiaofeng remaining as CEO. The other two senior executives of Mobike, Hu Weiwei and Xia Yiping, will remain president and chief technology officer, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mobike will help </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> customers to go to restaurants, go back home and travel around, becoming the best connection in forming a closed-loop shopping experience,” Wang said in an internal employee memo later published on </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> account. Hu Weiwei, a co-founder of Mobike, said in a </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> post that “it is a new beginning” and that there's “huge space for imagination” to work with </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> started off as a group-buying portal, before it merged with Dianping, a restaurant recommendation site. The combined entity is now pushing into food delivery and recently introduced ride-hailing in several Chinese cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal comes amid the further consolidation of the bicycle-sharing industry in China and </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s ramped up effort to expand into the country's transportation-on-demand sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bicycle-sharing has took off in late 2016 in China with dozens of startups placing millions of two-wheelers on city sidewalks, funded by venture capital money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake is an industry that is potentially worth about 24 billion yuan (US$3.8 billion) by 2019, according to market research firm iResearch. Beyond the rental revenue and prospects for advertising, bike-sharing companies are also seen by Chinese tech giants as effective tools to promote mobile payments and to collect user data that in theory can be analysed for consumer patterns useful for a broader internet-enabled transportation industry that involves ride-hailing and the rental business of cars, motorbike and bicycles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The acquisition will give Mobike a bigger backer in </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> as itpursues market dominance in bicycle sharing against its competitor Ofo, according toZhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The tie-up with Mobike is also expected to help </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> gain more customers data to help its push into transportation,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobike raised US$600 million last June in a financing round led by Tencent, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Mobike combination. Mobike's chief competitor Ofo is backed by e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns theSouth China Morning Post. Ofo said it did not have a comment for now, when asked how the </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Mobike acquisition will affect its strategy.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consumers in China are waiting longer for more significant upgrades in features before replacing their smartphones, contributing to a slowdown in sales in the world's largest mobile handset market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major Chinese smartphone firms are expected to increase their combined market share on the mainland this year, with the gains coming at the expense of small suppliers after the country recorded its first decline in smartphone shipments last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“More of the smaller smartphone players will be forced to exit the market in 2018 as we expect handset shipments in China to continue declining,” said Tay Xiaohan, a senior market analyst at technology research firm IDC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smartphone sales in China are dominated by the top five brands - </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Apple - with a 77 per cent share of the market, up from 67 per cent in 2016, according to Counterpoint.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major shake-up seen as Chinese smartphone market contracts for the first time ever[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2130690/major-shake-seen-chinese-smartphone-market-contracts-first-time-ever]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These larger, deep-pocketed Chinese smartphone suppliers have won a big chunk of the market through aggressive marketing, more attractive handset designs and features, and by offering a wider array of models available in a range of prices to entice both younger and affluent buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That leaves an estimated 200 Chinese smartphone companies to fight for the scraps. Just two years ago, there were as many as 300 of these firms offering inexpensive, knock-off handsets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Demand in China had doubled each year between 2010 and 2012 during the period when 3G mobile services were being rolled out across the country, but gradually slowed down from 2013 ahead of the deployment of faster 4G services by the mainland's three mobile network operators.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data from IDC showed that smartphone shipments on the mainland decreased 4.9 per cent to 444.3 million units last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In 2017, the minor upgrades that Chinese smartphone companies made to their offerings were not enough to move consumers to splurge on new models, resulting in a general slowdown in the market,” IDC's Tay said. “A key space to look out for in the coming year would be how the top smartphone companies seek to [drive consumer upgrades] through their US$200 products.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The top-20 smartphone brands control 93 per cent of the market,” said Counterpart research director Neil Shah. “That means 180 other brands are competing for just the remaining seven per cent share, which means we could see a potential exit for some of these firms this year.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the slowdown in China “has caused serious pain for tier-2 and tier-3 smartphone brands, such as Gionee, Coolpad and LeEco, which largely depend on domestic sales”. A further slowdown this year would make it more difficult for these companies to compete in terms of scale in component supply deals for production and in marketing, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With fewer marketing resources at their disposal, small Chinese smartphone companies will be absent at this year's edition of Mobile World Congress (MWC), the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, to be held in Barcelona, Spain, from February 26 to March 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year's absentees include Meizu, Gionee and Coolpad, which took part the past three years, and LeEco, which was at the event in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Meizu's domestic market share decreased last year, a spokesman said on Thursday that the company was profitable last year as its international sales have grown by more than 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Meizu's rapid international growth is set to continue in 2018, and we're already in talks with a number of potential partners to bring our products to even more countries next year,” the spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gionee declined to make any further comment from what its chief executive recently made public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coolpad did not respond to direct messages left on the firm's </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese smartphone brands have succeeded in competing against the likes of Apple and </span><span class="s3">Samsung Electronics</span><span class="s1"> chiefly by heavy marketing and offering similar design and features at a lower price. But that strategy has its limitations as most of these brands “are too identical to stand out from others”, said Zhao Ziming, a senior analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Cyzone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reliance on heavy marketing to gain buyers has burdened these brands with unsustainable costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Examples of lavish marketing programmes include hiring top celebrities for major advertising campaigns online, on television shows and in billboards prominently displayed at airports, undergrounds and bus stations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cat Fu, a smartphone vendor in Shenzhen's electronics-manufacturing hub of Huaqiangbei, said most retailers now only sell smartphone brands that are well established.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gionee, which is based in Shenzhen, had recently been the most active in marketing and promotions among the small Chinese smartphone brands.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November last year, Gionee threw down the gauntlet to Apple and its rival brands in China by releasing a family of full-screen smartphones, the cheapest of which sells for a tenth of the price of the iPhone X. At that time, Gionee said it was the world's first smartphone supplier to equip all new handsets with full 18:9 aspect ratio displays.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, however, a court in the southern coastal city of Dongguan froze for two years the 41.4 per cent stake in Gionee of company chairman and chief executive Liu Lirong because of the firm's failure to repay a number of its suppliers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu recently said that the company had overextended itself after spending a combined 9 billion yuan (US$1.4 billion) in marketing and investments over the past three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">O-film Tech</span><span class="s1">, a maker of touch screens as well as fingerprint identification and video head modules, said Gionee owed the company payments totalling 626 million yuan as of February 6 this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gionee's troubles followed those of LeEco. The cash-strapped internet conglomerate and smartphone supplier founded by entrepreneur Jia Yueting last year retreated from its expansion in the United States and abandoned its US$2 billion purchase of American television maker Vizio amid a mountain of debt, huge losses and court orders freezing its assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coolpad, the struggling smartphone company controlled by LeEco, last year was sued by Ping An Bank to repay a loan worth 80 million yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi targets return to No 1 spot in China's smartphone market in 10 quarters[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2132467/xiaomi-targets-return-no-1-spot-chinas-smartphone-market-10]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Counterpoint's Shah estimated that smartphone shipments in China last year for Gionee, Coolpad and LeEco were down by 25 per cent, 77 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively, from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These brands have fallen off the cliff,” he said. “They need to pull off a comeback. similar to Xiaomi's, but that looks very difficult.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Xiaomi was once the world's most valuable unicorn - a start-up worth more than US$1 billion - and top smartphone supplier in China. The company's smartphone sales, however, hit a severe slump in 2016, which senior management blamed on supply chain issues caused by its rapid expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which raised a US$1 billion loan from a syndicate of banks last year, recently set itself a goal of retaking the top spot in the domestic market within 10 quarters, backed by a strategy to build up the number of its bricks-and-mortar stores to complement the firm's online retail platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China, the world's largest consumer electronics market, is the foundation of Xiaomi, and the high ground that global smartphone makers are vying for,” Xiaomi founder and chief executive Lei Jun said earlier this month. “Only if we win the local market can we continue to support steady expansion overseas.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Experience running an ultra marathon can be a hindrance when knowing what is coming adds to the nerves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Australian ultra runner Ben Duffus has been out with an injury for so long, he has almost forgotten what running 50 kilometres is like.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Sunday, he will take on the 9 Dragons 50km race in Hong Kong - his first ultra marathon in over a year after suffering a bulged disk in his back.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[When you've been injured] you haven't experienced it in a while so you are sort of back to being a beginner when ignorance is bliss and you don't know what you're in for,” Duffus said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But on the other hand, he is hungry to get back on the trails, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 9 Dragons is a two-day race. On Saturday, runners take on 50 miles (80km) and on Sunday they race again on a 50km route. They can do both, or one race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The race follows a route and a legend. Local myths say in the 13th century, an Emperor visited Kowloon. Noticing the eight hills - Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill, Crow's Nest - the Emperor named them the “Eight Dragons”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A quick-witted courtier pointed out that the Emperor was a dragon himself, making it nine dragons, not eight, according to the race website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first race involves 4,000 metres of elevation, and the second has 3,200m. With some of the shortest cut-off times between check points, it is one of the hardest races in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's about finding that red line between what you can do and what you can't do,” said Duffus, who came second in the Ultra Trail Australia 2016. “If I can get close to that, keep the pace sustainable, keep the mindset positive, and get the nutrition right then the time will look after itself.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kellie Emmerson will be running races on both days. This is her first race since the Ultra Marathon of Mont Blanc in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the 170km race took a toll on her body, and she has been recovering since.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was the hardest race of my life, it was very cold,” Emmerson said. “I had never been on my feet for 15 hours before, and I almost doubled that. I had never run at minus-10 degrees Celsius before.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Emmerson has picked a bold race as her first event back. She has run stage races before, but has never run such long distances back-to-back.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think Sunday will hurt a lot. But it's OK, I'm prepared for that pain,” she said, and with her compression gear and a lot of hydration she will be able to enjoy the second race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I am looking forward to exploring a new place, and a lot of pain and a lot of stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both runners expressed nerves about the impending staircases notorious in Hong Kong trail running.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Duffus said: “I knew there were a lot of stairs ... It's one thing to know it, it is another thing to experience.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing ByteDance Technology, the operator of China's dominant news aggregator Toutiao, has bought social video app Musical.ly, its second acquisition in a week as it aggressively seeks new users by widening its range of content offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ByteDance did not give financial details of the deal in a statement on Friday, but Chinese media reports said the acquisition of Musical.ly, an app especially popular with teenagers that allows users to post videos of themselves accompanying their favourite songs, was valued at between US$800 million and US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal is expected to boost ByteDance's presence overseas, adding Musical.ly's around 100 million users worldwide - according to media reports - to Toutiao's 120 million, most of whom are white-collar workers in smaller cities in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“By integrating Musical.ly's global reach with ByteDance's massive user base in China and key Asian markets, we are creating a significant global platform for our content creators and brands to engage with new markets,” said Zhang Yiming, founder and chief executive of ByteDance, in the statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the same time, our world-leading artificial intelligence technology will help Musical.ly to accelerate their incredible pace of innovation in mobile video creation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The acquisition is the latest overseas venture for ByteDance, a Beijing-based start-up founded in 2012 which ranks 12th in the CB Insights' Global Unicorn Club list with a valuation of US$11 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this week ByteDance acquired news and video aggregation platform News Republic from China's Cheetah Mobile - itself an early investor in Musical.ly - for US$86.6 million. In February it bought US video creation app </span><span class="s3">Flipagram</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ByteDance said Musical.ly will continue to operate as an independent platform, but the two will work together to extend Musical.ly's reach in China and around Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ByteDance's Toutiao app uses AI to analyse readers' habits and send them customised content. It also runs TopBuzz, an English-language news app similar to Toutiao.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In sharp contrast, China's own national internet champions don't figure at all in the portfolios of mainland Chinese investors. Shares in Alibaba, Baidu and Weibo, to name three, are publicly listed, but on US, rather than mainland Chinese stock exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That hasn't detracted from their share price performance, which has been just as impressive as that of the FAANGs. Last year, shares in Weibo, for example, leapt by 149 per cent. But with access to US markets forbidden by China's regulations, mainland investors, who love nothing better than a hot tech stock, have badly missed out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Until now. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities published regulations to govern the listing on mainland exchanges of so-called Chinese depositary receipts, or CDRs. These instruments will, for the first time, allow ordinary Chinese investors to buy a stake in their favourite technology giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first CDRs will hit the market in the middle of July, when Xiaomi, the world's fourth largest smartphone maker, launches its US$10 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong. As part of that deal, the company plans to issue CDRs worth up to US$3 billion in the mainland market. Other Chinese technology stars are tipped to follow in rapid succession.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is a catch. The new securities are called CDRs in emulation of the American Depositary Receipts, which, over recent decades have so successfully allowed US shareholders to invest in the equity of non-US companies. However, there is a crucial difference between ADRs and CDRs, which will greatly complicate the CDR investment story.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ADRs are fully fungible with their underlying shares. This means new ADRs can be created (or deleted) in line with market demand. If the demand is there, brokers bundle up shares listed in the company's home country and lodge them with a depositary bank, which then issues receipts that can be traded in the US. As a result, ADRs always trade in line with the price of their underlying shares, as any significant divergence in price would instantly be arbitraged away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, a company's CDRs will not be fungible with its primary shares listed offshore. In effect they will be an entirely new class of stock, not securities created by bundling together underlying shares. That means their supply will be inflexible, not adjustable like the supply of ADRs. And because arbitrage between the mainland's markets and markets offshore is difficult at best, and often impossible, large price discrepancies are likely to open up between a company's CDRs and its primary shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's not difficult to guess which way these discrepancies will tilt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Demand for the new CDRs will be enormous. Chinese investors are just as keen on tech stocks, probably keener, than their US counterparts. But supply will be limited. For one thing, issuing companies will be anxious not to overly dilute their existing shareholders in offshore markets. And not only will brokers be prohibited from creating new units on demand, but a sizeable proportion of CDR issues will be reserved for six new “unicorn funds” backed by state institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In theory, retail investors will be able to invest in these funds. But a cap on investment and their mandatory three-year lock-up period will put many off. As a result, most ordinary investors will either have to be lucky enough to win an allocation in the initial offering, or they will be left to scramble for CDRs in the secondary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An initial allocation is highly unlikely: last month's mainland Chinese IPO for Foxconn Industral Internet was oversubscribed by almost 300 times. And competition in the secondary market will be intense. China's regulators cap the valuation of new issues. And in any case, CDR issuers will be careful to issue the new securities at the same valuation as their offshore shares, lest they be accused of gouging investors. As a result, to Chinese investors, the new securities will look like a steal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu, for example, is trading in the US on a price-earnings ratio of 35. In contrast, Chinese-listed information technology stocks are trading at a median valuation of 52. And many are trading at much, much richer valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, Shenzhen-listed satellite positioning services company </span><span class="s3">Beijing BDStar Navigation</span><span class="s1"> is currently on a price-earnings ratio of 139.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, when CDRs hit the market, we can expect the same sort of buying frenzy that pushed shares in Foxconn's subsidiary up by 44 per cent on its first day of trading. And it won't just be the first day. Such spectacular gains generate a momentum of their own as they attract still more buyers to the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The typical new listing on the mainland trades limit-up for 10 days in a row, rising 150 per cent. The most popular new issues - which will surely include CDR offerings from well-known tech giants - typically trade limit-up for almost four weeks in a row after listing, rising by more than 400 per cent in price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That might not sound like a problem. But there is a big probability that a spate of popular CDR issues coming to market in quick succession will inflate the sort of broader momentum-driven stock market bubble that in 2015 saw the entire Shenzhen market climb double in just three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If so, it is likely that the authorities will again step in to try and dampen the market with ill-advised comments, mass stock suspensions, and heavy-handed regulatory tightening. In 2015, they precipitated a 50 per cent crash that saw many investors, locked in by suspensions, wiped out entirely. So if you are tempted to try and participate in the mainland's coming CDR boom, be prepared for a wild ride. ■</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 50 companies from across the world have expressed interest in applying for virtual bank licences, with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> setting August 31 as the deadline for receiving applications for the first batch of purely online banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have set up a special team to handle the applications,” HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen Kwok-hang told a media briefing after Hong Kong's de facto central bank and regulator issued the guidelines on Wednesday. “For those who want to be among the first batch of applicants, they should submit the application before the end of August.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuen said he was not be sure if all these 50 firms would submit applications, although many of them had already given some initial information about their business plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies came from Hong Kong, the mainland and elsewhere,” Yuen said and hoped that the first licences could be issued by the end of this year or the first quarter of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA will scrutinise the IT platform of the applicants, the viability of their business plans and their financial background.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now that the guidelines have been issued the applicants can formally apply for a licence immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simon Loong, co-founder of the home-grown fintech unicorn WeLab, who had previously told the Post that his company would be among the first applicants for a virtual banking licence, welcomed the move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe the HKMA has provided clear guidance on the expectations for the operational and risk management of a virtual bank, to facilitate the application process for interested applicants such as WeLab,” Loong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now that the HKMA has set out the clear criteria for priority handling of virtual bank applications ... we will strive to be in the first batch of applicants for the virtual banking licence in Hong Kong and continue to promote financial inclusion and Fintech development in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The virtual banking regulations are not much different from the proposals set forth for consultations in February, with all 25 respondents including the Hong Kong Association of Banks, and the Consumer Council supporting the proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab joins fintech race to become Hong Kong's first licensed virtual bank[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2144899/welab-joins-fintech-race-become-hong-kongs-first-licensed]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam last September announced plans to introduce virtual banks in Hong Kong to usher in a “new era of smart banking”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Virtual banks looking to set up in Hong Kong will need to have at least HK$300 million (US$38.36 million) in capital, and cannot impose a minimum account balance or low balance fees. They cannot charge excessively high interest rates or engage in over-aggressive strategies to compete for market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although these virtual banks will only operate online, the authority requires them to have at least one physical office that can also handle complaints from customers. They would need to have an exit plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuen also said the HKMA was yet to set a cap for issuing licences and that some conventional banks had expressed interest in applying for a virtual bank licence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expects the virtual banks to offer simple services such as deposits and lending for individuals and SMEs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's best will be arrayed in force on Sunday at Sha Tin as they begin their campaigns towards the internationals in December, and John Moore says his big-race bridesmaid Irian can cause a surprise in the Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The imposing figure of the Tony Millard-trained Ambitious Dragon, two-times Horse Of the Year, stands atop a Sha Tin Trophy field that also includes the winners of last season's Champions Mile, Hong Kong Cup, Derby and Champions &amp; Chater Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ambitious Dragon is the likely favourite, and as such, will be out to turn over more than two decades of history. No outright favourite has won the race since 1990, with upset victors all the way up to Packing Winner's 160-1 shock three years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moore has sorted out jockeys for his six runners in this weekend's race and nominated Brett Prebble's mount Irian as the one who could cause the upset this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They are all well but I'd say Irian is going to run a whopper," Moore said yesterday. "Xtension might just need this run, having in mind we want him to peak on international day, and the same is true of Zaidan. Military Attack has a light weight and he could be a knockout for that reason, but he isn't trained up yet."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moore is basing his expectations of Irian on having found a cure for the gelding "speedy cutting", a term that refers to a horse's hooves making contact with his other feet or legs during his running action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We've got Irian's shoeing right again so that he doesn't speedy cut himself and he has been very impressive in his work," Moore said. "I know 2,000 metres probably is his best distance, but Irian has been effective from a mile up so I think he'll run a great race."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Group Three Premier Bowl for the sprinters has not exactly been a picnic for punters: Cheerful Fortune was the last outright favourite to win that, nine years ago, and John Size stunned horseplayers last year with Rich Unicorn's 64-1 win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moore will have four runners there, too, after switching Majestic Falcon from the Class Two event, where he would have been a reserve runner. He will join stablemate Captain Sweet, Leading City and Able Speed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab, Hong Kong's home-grown fintech unicorn, is poised to be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking license from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, according to its co-founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have been working closely with the HKMA over the consultation of the virtual banking regulation over the past few months. We would like to be among the first to file a formal application for a virtual banking license which I believe would be an important step forward for the development of smart banking in Hong Kong,” saidSimon Loong Pui-chi, the founder and chief executive of WeLab in an exclusive interview with theSouth China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the coming weeks, the HKMA [https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-monetary-authority-hkma] is due to issue guidelines for virtual banking regulation based on a consultation in February. Expectations are for the first licenses to be issued by the end of the year. The HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam last September announced plans to introduce virtual banking in Hong Kong in what he described as a “new era of smart banking”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loong, 41, a native Hongkonger, co-founded WeLab with his 34-year old Taiwanese wife Frances Kang Tzu-ping and another partner, Kelly Wong, in 2013. In five years, the company has grown to 600 staff and 30 million customers in Hong Kong and mainland China. While Loong refused to talk about the company's valuation or listing plan, Hong Kong stockbrokers speculated the companycould have a valuation of more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the company operates online money lending platform WeLend. In the mainland, it has teamed with local partners to operate the online lending platform WoLaiDai. It plans to expand into Indonesia in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Getting a virtual banking license from the HKMA would allow us to expand our services. This would allow WeLab to diversify its business to become a full services bank,” Loong said. “Developing virtual banking in Hong Kong would also allow the city to catch up with international markets as many US and European markets already have pure online banking operators.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November WeLab raised US$220 million [http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2118976/hong-kong-fintech-firm-welab-raises-us220m-funding-round] from private investors in Hong Kong.WeLab's shareholders include Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, </span><span class="s3">International Finance Corp</span><span class="s1"> and other global banks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loong, a former banker with 15 years experience at institutions that include </span><span class="s3">Citibank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">, took a mid career break to pursue studies in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was joined by his then girlfriend and fellow banker Kang, who he met at </span><span class="s3">Citibank</span><span class="s1"> where she had worked for four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two took undertook studies at </span><span class="s3">Stanford University</span><span class="s1">, with Kang completing an MBA while Loong finished a master's degree in management. Loong and Kang were married in June 2012, a week after their final examinations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The newlyweds initially explored the idea of a start-up that would provide a platform to advise men on fashion choices and help source and deliver wardrobe updates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many Silicon Valley guys relied on their mothers or girlfriends to buy clothes for them. We considered whether we could help them to prepare a set of trendy clothes, matching their style and skin tone,” Kang recalled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when they came back to Hong Kong, they found local men prefer shopping for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is true that Hong Kong needs more of a fintech revolution than a fashion revolution,” Kang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Back in 2012, we witnessed how Silicon Valley fintech companies were using technology to provide financial services at a lower cost and a more efficient manner.We considered a great opportunities in Hong Kong and the mainland by using big data and technology to offer financial services,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you go to a bank and ask for a loan for HK$500, banks are not interested because their operating cost is very high. They need to pay for rent of the branches and salaries. A banker said any loan below HK$200,000 (US$25,482) is not that profitable. This is why some individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises find it hard to get small loans,” Loong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab has lower overhead costs as it does not have any physical branches, while it also relies on technology to control risk and answer customers queries.The lender's average loans size in Hong Kong is about HK$80,000, whilemainland borrowers range between 8,000 yuan (US$1,257) to 10,000 yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Veteran securities regulator Huang Hongyuan has been appointed chairman of the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> , signalling Beijing's commitment to attracting technology companies and broadening links with international markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang, 54, will fill the vacancy left by Wu Qing who became a vice-mayor of Shanghai in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities regulator said in a statement on Sunday that Huang will carry the rank of vice-minister following the appointment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang's appointment was announced on Friday during a meeting in which </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> chairman Liu Shiyu urged exchange officials to make a priority of attracting high-quality companies to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange is actively seeking to attract technology companies with valuations of more than US$1 billion - as the central government encourages capital raising activities to help foster growth in the new economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> published a draft operating guide for the Chinese Depository Receipt (CDR) mechanism, a move intended to facilitate technology “unicorn” initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the CDR system, part of a company's shares are transferred to a custodian bank, which sells them on an exchange abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The role of the stock exchange's top boss is important now because of the task of luring technology firms,” said Zhou Ling, a fund manager with Shanghai Shiva Investment. “An official with experience in running the exchange is a proper choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, Beijing would appoint a senior </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> official to head the Shanghai exchange, rather than promoting an official from within the managerial ranks of the exchange as chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang became executive vice-president of the Shanghai exchange in 2011 before he was nominated president the following year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between 1992 and 2011, he served at the </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1">, assuming a number of roles, including director of the risk management office and deputy director of the fund supervision department.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> did not say who will take up the position vacated by Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luring unicorns is part of an effort to support transition of the Chinese economy into a sustainable growth model driven by entrepreneurship and consumer spending.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, major Chinese technology companies conducted IPOs on overseas markets such as Hong Kong and New York because their ownership structure was not in compliance with mainland requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing. Have something to say? Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Jockey Club handicappers agree, lifting Beauty Generation's local rating to an astonishing 137 after Sunday's win in the Group Two Sha Tin Vase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To put that in perspective, that is the highest domestic rating since Able Friend had 138 (which he earned after winning the Premier Bowl in 2015).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It easily eclipses the marks held by the likes of Mr Stunning, Thewizardofoz, Ivictory, D B Pin (all 128) during their reigns as the highest-rated horses in Hong Kong, while he is also clear of Good Ba Ba and Sacred Kingdom (131), Silent Witness (132), Military Attack and Designs On Rome (133), Ambitious Dragon and Fairy King Prawn (134). That is a who's who of recent Hong Kong racing history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Electronic Unicorn, the superstar from the early 2000s, was another who reached the heights of 138.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That just goes to show the exalted company Beauty Generation is in and the merit of his two victories this season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, there are some differing opinions about how strong Beauty Generation's hold on the Hong Kong Mile is.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From a weights and measures perspective, he looks unbeatable - he has given weight to all his rivals and still been far too good for them. Given only one international raider (Maurice) has upstaged the locals in the past 12 editions, it looks like he has one hand on the trophy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beauty Generation's dominance won't keep raiders away from Hong Kong International Races: John Moore[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2169559/beauty-generations-dominance-wont-keep-raiders-away-hong-kong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But others (including some trainers and ratings experts), believe Beauty Generation is only thriving because of how the races are being run - low pressure contests that suit him down to the ground. If there is an injection of pace to challenge the six-year-old early, then he could come unstuck and it would open things up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Equally, there are differing views to the amount of pressure Beauty Generation faced on Sunday, even though the overall time was just .36 of a second outside Good Ba Ba's 1,600m track record (set in 2008).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jockey Zac Purton thought he was pestered all the way, Chad Schofield said "it was a shame Beauty Generation wasn't softened up a bit more”. It is a game of opinions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In any case, Beauty Generation is a "champion”[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2169550/john-moores-beauty-generation-enters-champion-class-blistering-sha-tin] - John Moore's description - and if he can hold his form through to the December, he is going to be incredibly tough to beat.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking of ratings, Frankie Lor's star four-year-old went up 10 points (to 106) after his impressive return on Sunday and he looks the one they have to catch in the Group Three Sa Sa Ladies' Purse on November 4.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purton believes Glorious Forever still has plenty to learn, but if he can perform like that when there is still more upside, then good luck to the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time Warp's brother Glorious Forever continues to do a striking impression of his older sibling and destroys a smart field in R4 from a mark of 96 under @zpurton[https://twitter.com/zpurton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw].

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He's obviously got an engine, he's a talented horse but once again he never really relaxed either, he was on the bit all the way,” Purton said after the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been plenty of talk comparing Glorious Forever to his full-brother, two-time Group One winner Time Warp, which is only natural given their front-running styles and development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Glorious Forever eyes big brother Time Warp's Hong Kong Cup crown after blistering win[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2169538/glorious-forever-eyes-big-brother-time-warps-hong-kong-cup-crown-after]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the questions has been "who will Zac ride?” when they clash - and it looks like they will in the Ladies' Purse - but Purton might get to delay the choice as he won't be able to make the weight to partner Glorious Forever (who is likely to get 113 pounds).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Assuming the younger brother takes out the Ladies' Purse, his rating will be high enough to ensure he gets a run in the Hong Kong Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given he makes his own luck, he would certainly be in the market, but there is a lot of water to go under the bridge.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The championships have got a business as usual look about them with Douglas Whyte and John Size putting the foot down on the accelerator in recent meetings, but it was the dead-heat win for Fulfil A Wish in the Chevalier Cup that gave Size the most satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holyangelholy and promising Happy Era saw Size and Whyte notch a double together earlier in the card, but Fulfil A Wish arrived just in time to claim half of the feature with Ben So Tik-hung aboard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fulfil A Wish and the Tony Cruz-trained outsider Penglai Xianzi (Vincent Ho Chak-yiu) couldn't be separated on the wire in a blanket finish to an event that was a far cry from when Size first took it out 11 years ago with top-class miler Electronic Unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But I'm happy with a deadheat because I thought he'd got beaten - and I'm happy to win anything with Fulfil A Wish because it really has been tough for him to win at this level he's at now," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He's so honest, he doesn't lose any points, he just tries. He in there giving it his best all the time and when a race comes along where none of the others is really flying - which is what we had today - then he's able to get into the finish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Last three starts I've asked him to run a mile and he's tried hard, and 1,800m and he's tried hard and back to 1,400m and he does his best wherever you put him. Ben rode him well and he was able to get a win, but I'm not sure what the next trick will be."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The same was probably true of many of the runners, including the other dead-heater Penglai Xianzi, who had been battling since his rating went into three figures last season and only half-a-length covered the first five home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unbeaten Happy Era is a different matter altogether, with the rising four-year-old taking himself out of Class Three at his third start with another tradesmanlike performance in the seventh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He's got speed to put himself in a position, he could travel a little better through his races but that's just him, then when you ask him to pick up he does it. He's not much to look at but he's shown some quality to win three out of three and quite quickly - not many do that here," said Size, although he said the Classic Mile may come too soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There isn't much time between now and the middle of January and Happy Era would need to find some more ratings points to put himself into a race like that."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whyte said the gelding's professionalism was going to help him to punch above his weight even as Happy Era got higher in the ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He didn't have it that easy today, I had to use him a little to get around Lucky Warrior early, but when he got there he just went to sleep," Whyte said. "Those manners will take him a fair way and he feels like he'll be better at a mile and maybe further."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seven Seas Partners, a venture capital firm founded by Tencent Holdings' former chief technology officer, has led a 350 million yuan (US$53.6 million) funding round in a Chinese start-up, betting big to find the next Chinese tech giant in the robot sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funding for Roobo, a Beijing start-up that sells conversational service robots, would lift the firm's valuation close to that of a unicorn - private companies valuated at US$1 billion or more, according to the company's chief executive Liu Yingbo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from the capital injection announced on Wednesday, Jeff Xiong Minghua, who was Tencent's CTO for eight years until his departure from the social networking giant in 2013, will also serve as the chairman of the board of Roobo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I really hope that I can find and cultivate the next Tencent in China. The thing that I regretted most when leaving Tencent was that I didn't help turn the company into a truly globalised company, ” said Xiong. He said the artificial intelligence (AI) era provided China with real opportunities to produce global companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multibillion-dollar valuation are very likely to be those involved in service robotics and the Internet of Things, as Xiong estimates that there will be 10 billion smart devices in use in China, with more hardware - from home appliances to cars - being connected to the internet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment comes amid the rising interest in AI in China, where the central government has unveiled a top-down nationwide plan in July through a three-step approach to become a global AI leader by 2030.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Money is not an issue for us. What we want is to bring Jeff's experience and vision in tech industry to make us into a big player in China and abroad,” said Liu, Roobo's chief executive.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you listen to the trainers of Ambitious Dragon and Glorious Days - the leading chances for tomorrow's Longines Hong Kong Mile - the mutual admiration flows so freely you could easily get the impression they would switch horses for one race if they could.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A day after Glorious Days' handler, John Size, declared Ambitious Dragon "unbeatable" if the two-time defending Horse of the Year brings his 'A' game, his trainer Tony Millard returned serve, saying his up-and-coming rival "has the race at his mercy".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Frankly speaking, the way that horse is going, Glorious Days will be very, very difficult to beat," Millard said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He has got everything going his way. He has improved, he is young and he has drawn perfectly in gate three. As much as I am happy with my horse - you've got to have respect for him."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have fought two thrilling domestic duels already this term, finishing one-two both times. Ambitious Dragon dominated first-up, before a move to blinkers by Size coaxed a career-best performance from Glorious Days in the Jockey Club Mile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He just improved so much last start. I wish I had a set of blinkers like that," Millard joked, before adding that the fancied pair's disparate draws - Ambitious Dragon jumps from gate 11 - further swung things in Glorious Days' favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Douglas Whyte will dictate the race from that draw," Millard said. "In saying that, I'm pretty comfortable with our draw, too. We've run our best races from out there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Whenever we've been on the outside, he's been under pressure. It's tough on the inside, because you can get blocked or race too close."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Ambitious Dragon failed in his three biggest races last season - all international Group Ones, including the Hong Kong Cup as 2.1 favourite - international day 2012 has steadily shaped as a date with destiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Millard didn't buy into the suggestion his horse's performance would define his legacy, and avoid him being labelled a "backyard bully".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He is just phenomenal. It's every trainer's dream to have a horse like this, one that is so versatile," he said. "He has done enough in my eyes and is as good as I can have him. He worked nice this morning and is going super. I couldn't be more happy with him going into this race, but you've just got to respect Mr Size's horse."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size himself is looking to get a monkey off his back. The seven-time champion trainer has finished runner-up in the Mile three times; with Armada in 2006 and Electronic Unicorn in 2001 and 2002. "I'd like to put it right," he said. Even though Glorious Days' rating peaked in the Jockey Club Mile - and there is the chance of a dip in his performance this time out - Size said his horse had maintained a healthy appearance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He seems OK and he has done well since the Jockey Club Mile," he said. "It looked a tough run for him, and a good performance, but he seems the same at home."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As much as Size is a fan of Millard's horse, he feels a performance from Glorious Days equal to that of last start should be enough to break his drought in the feature race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If he can repeat it, that should be enough to win the race. I don't have too many concerns, it's an ideal draw on paper," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trainer Ricky Yiu Poon-fai was oozing confidence that Packing Dragon still had some upside and could defy a long-time curse after clinching an unlikely victory in the 2017 Happy Valley Million Challenge on Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a track where leaders proved impossible to run down - seven of the eight winners were in front turning for home - Packing Dragon (Chad Schofield) surprised with the early pace he showed to get across from a wide gate at a distance short of his ideal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After getting a breather mid-race, the half-brother to former champion Ambitious Dragon stuck on stoutly to hold off the finish of Circuit Land by a head and the Million Challenge was his.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was an unlikely victory mainly because past winners of the series, which runs at Happy Valley from September to February each season for Class Three and above, have more often been sprinters or milers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is the first time he has won under 1,800m but we had to run at 1,650m because there were no longer races available. He appreciated having a light weight in the higher class, probably having the outside barrier wasn't bad for him because he got a clear run across and it was good to have a jockey who knows him well,” said Yiu, who bought the gelding as a yearling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This mare Golden Gamble has been very good - obviously, Ambitious Dragon was a champion but she also had Triumphant Dragon who won a few races here. I fell in love with this horse as a yearling. He was so well balanced and he wasn't expensive - NZ$170,000.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Million Challenge winners have a gloomy history and few ever win again after taking the Challenge, although last year's victor, Speedy Longwah, did manage a success this season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Well, I think this horse could be an exception,” said Yiu. “He's a slow-maturing sort, he's only five and I think there is some more to come. Even being able to win at the shorter distance tonight shows he is still improving.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Packing Dragon's 15 points last night for winning took him to 53 points and the HK$650,000 first prize, heading off overnight Million Challenge leader Happy Spirit, who was unable to improve on his 46 points in the same race. Victory Marvel, who didn't race on the night, held on to third with 44 points for Caspar Fownes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Fownes, the hard luck story of a type was Blocker Dee, a dead-heater for first in the sixth race after looking to have won, and a clear win would have given him second in the Million Challenge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The judge can't split Sea Jade and Blocker Dee in the Class 1 Happy Valley Trophy (1200m) #HKRacing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKRacing?src=hash] pic.twitter.com/bB71w0vyYV[https://t.co/bB71w0vyYV]— HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) February 15, 2017[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/831867920070217736]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a shame but at least he got half a win - he's very honest, he's run his race and the inside draw helped him but the leaders pulling up in the middle of the race definitely didn't,” Fownes said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joao Moreira landed his usual three wins, while Alexis Badel produced what is quickly becoming his trademark mid-race move around the field to score a long-odds double on Unicorn and Rickfield.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Badel has now ridden seven winners during his stint, due to end on February 26, four of them coming with the looping run around field before the home turn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Silvestre de Sousa's stint was due to end that same day but he will finish up this Sunday instead after incurring the wrath of stewards for an incident early in race three and getting a two-day ban and HK$75,000 fine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nash Rawiller also managed to find his way on to the suspended list again, an incident late in the final race earning him a three-meeting suspension, starting March 1, and a HK$100,000 fine.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - or so the saying goes. Some people prefer tall and slender while others prefer short and cuddly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever your preference, in today's image-conscious social media world people generally want to look the best they can, and that's why SenseTime, the world's most highly-valued artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is offering a filter for smartphone cameras and live-streaming apps that can automatically touch you up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Powered by AI-backed technology, the filter identifies different parts of a user's body and face, and touches them up automatically to enhance their look - without distorting the background. The feature marks a major step up from existing products in the market that allow users to mainly “beautify” still pictures of faces and selfies, according to SenseTime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a convenience feature - for example, imagine you feel like live streaming at 10pm but want to skip putting on make-up just for that,” said Li Xingye, SenseTime vice-president of internet and adverts business, at a product launch event held in Beijing on Wednesday. Li said the company will seek to embed the touch-up function into the live-streaming apps of major players via fee-paying partnerships.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">World's most valuable AI start-up SenseTime raises US$620 million[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2148563/worlds-most-valuable-ai-start-sensetime-raises-us620-million]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded at the Hong Kong Science Park in 2014, SenseTime specialises in facial recognition and computer vision, and has positioned itself as a “platform company” for AI technologies. Known for providing AI-powered surveillance software for China's police, SenseTime said it achieved profitability last year on the back of selling AI-powered applications for smart cities, surveillance, smartphones, internet entertainment, finance, retail and other industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company assumed the mantle of the world's most valuable AI start-up in May, with a US$620 million round of financing that valued it at US$4.5 billion. The financing came hot on the heels of an earlier round in April led by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, the parent company of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The live-streaming market has enjoyed explosive growth in China in recent years, and is estimated to be worth US$4.4 billion in 2018 with viewer numbers topping 456 million, according to a Deloitte report. In June, the percentage of time spent on messaging apps among mobile users declined from 36 to 30.2 per cent compared to the same time last year, while time spent on short video apps rose from 2 to 8.8 per cent, according to figures provided by internet data services provider QuestMobile.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To stand out from the crowd, live streamers in China do everything from zany stunts to eating mountains of food, and many go under the surgeon's knife to improve their looks and boost popularity. In the business of live-streaming, getting more attention means earning more money from the “tips” given by fans, as well as from advertising and sponsorship revenue. At peak times each day, more than 100 platforms are live-streaming across China, creating new “internet stars” along the way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the top live-streaming platforms in China include Meitu-owned Meipai, a fashion and beauty-inspired app that has also attracted brands such as </span><span class="s3">L'Oreal</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Maybelline</span><span class="s1"> as users. Meitu markets a range of phones and apps that enable users to beautify their selfies. Meanwhile Huajiao Live, initially part of an incubator run by </span><span class="s3">Qihoo 360</span><span class="s1">, features hundreds of home-made live shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What it takes to be an Internet live-streaming star in China[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2124190/eating-yogurt-deadly-stunts-what-it-takes-be-live-streaming-star]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worldwide, Meitu's apps generate about 6 billion photos a month, and it has been estimated that more than half the selfies uploaded on Chinese social media have been edited using Meitu's products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, SenseTime's “beautifying” function includes settings to adjust the slimness of a user's face, arms, legs, and stomach. There is also an option to broaden or trim down shoulder width or heighten hips to look curvier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Users should beware though - this magic can only work via the auto-beautifying function - face-to-face meetings still require the usual effort to look good.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After wobbling for a few weeks, tech stocks are dropping[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2159986/reversal-fortune-tencent-and-chinese-tech-stocks-are-crashing] like in 2000. This is likely to be the beginning of the end for the biggest tech bubble in history. The US-China trade war[https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war], rising interest rates, and falling exchange rates appear to have finally staunched the liquidity inflow into the bubble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And as in 2000, while the stock bloodbath could be over quickly, the economy would take years to recover from the economic fallout and financial damage inflicted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike in 2000, this tech bubble is bigger in China than in the United States[https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states]. The current tech wave in the US is dominated by companies that have good cash flows. They are not gobbling up cash. Hence, the US tech burst will lead to reasonable valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expectation that these companies could keep growing rapidly is a pipe dream. Because they take business away from existing companies, rather than create new business, there is a cap on how big they can be.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Things will be different in China. China's tech bubble is very similar to the US dotcom bubble in 2000. There are many companies being financed because they are doing something linked to technology. And, if they get revenue going, the market extrapolates it into infinity and gives them enormous valuations. Hence, they are encouraged to “buy” revenue through subsidies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means the bubble needs more and more cash to stay afloat. When there are lots of stupid people with lots of money, the game keeps going. But that kind of situation doesn't last very long. As monetary tightening happens around the world, credulous people tend to lose access to money quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 2000 bubble was marked by many con jobs, just not on the scale of the WorldCom and </span><span class="s3">Enron</span><span class="s1"> scandals. These tech companies misled investors with false expectations, even if they didn't cook the books.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China today is in a very similar situation. The obvious example is the P2P (peer-to-peer) boom. It has been a blatant con job from the start. But there were so many credulous savers to be robbed. There was enough money sloshing around to entice both the government and media to join in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cryptocurrencies[https://www.scmp.com/topics/digital-currencies] are another blatant example. There is enough evidence to show that they are a scam, and the market has plummeted lately[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2156165/after-six-months-record-losses-can-cryptocurrencies-look-forward-hack-proof]. Yet the media is still hyping it, and not many governments are banning it outright.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This coin issuer is all cashed up amid China's ban, but is it all hype?[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2157587/tron-cashed-us70-m-coin-sale-chinas-ico-ban-where-it-going]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's tech scene is full of semi con jobs. The main reason is government subsidies. In the past few years, local governments have been given the green light to pour money into tech. Suddenly, China has as many unicorns as the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local governments are competing on how many unicorns they have. As in other areas, numbers can be massaged easily. A few guys sit around to decide the valuation of a start-up. When they say it's a unicorn, it pleases their investors and the government.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government support has greatly contributed to the bubble. There are dozens of automobile start-ups. China hasn't got one competitive auto company at present. Why should the market believe that there could be dozens in the future? There are over 2,000 drone companies. Virtually every city is starting a tech park. In one park I visited, some 5,000 start-ups registered last year, mostly with their parents' money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China's A-share market[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2153074/shanghai-index-rebounds-first-time-after-entering-bear] has been collapsing, many are turning to Hong Kong to raise money[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144880/huge-number-chinese-tech-unicorns-likely-ipo-hong-kong-2018-says] or cash out. It is virtually the only hope. As US sentiment turns sour towards China, the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> isn't likely to be friendly to Chinese “concept companies” - that is, companies that promise an innovative product or service but which look set for big losses as far as the eye can see. As Hong Kong is exposed to international turbulence, the recent developments seem to have weighed heavily.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is possible that the Chinese government is directing funds to support the tech IPOs in Hong Kong. But, I doubt that it could mobilise enough money to do it alone. Beijing spends money to entice retail investors. Even in the politically sensitive A-share market, it hasn't managed to keep the market stable. Even if government-directed funds help to launch a few initial public offerings, they will collapse afterwards, making them useless as funding vehicles over time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's tech scene will resemble the US' in the aftermath of the 2000 crash. Most dotcom companies folded, causing massive lay-offs and the loss of trillions of dollars in paper wealth. The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> inflated a property bubble to rescue the economy, which led to the 2008 collapse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China's case, the property market is already a massive bubble. It may burst soon. There are few obvious options for China to bring back economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Retaliating against US tariffs is not in China's interest. Reform is[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2156046/escalating-us-trade-war-not-chinas-interest]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has been obsessed with tech. The current bubble features companies that use the internet to take business away from existing companies; so-called “disruption”. Airlines use commercial jets, probably the most hi-tech equipment in the consumer market, to carry people from A to B. But we don't call airline companies hi-tech. Using hi-tech equipment doesn't make a company hi-tech. It is puzzling why the government has manoeuvred so many resources into a bubble that won't have a meaningful legacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only structural reforms can bring back good growth in China. Instead of wasting so much on pointless bubbles, China should go back to the fundamentals: cutting wasteful investment and returning the money to the people, while encouraging companies to be the best in what they do, instead of playing financial games.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">California Whip is yet to live up to the expectations that followed his impressive arrival in Hong Kong 18 months ago but the five-year-old's victory in the Class One Hong Kong Macau Trophy (1,400m) suggests he might be heading in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Neil Callan aboard, the gelding dug deep in the straight to reel in leader Calculation and trainer Tony Cruz has his sights set on the Group Three Sha Tin Vase on May 27, potentially followed by the Group Three Premier Cup on June 24.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I won on him on the dirt over 1,200m and he broke the track record in Class Three carrying top weight,” Callan said about California Whip's first victory in Hong Kong in January last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the four-year-old series [last season] he had actually been mixing form quite well - he ran well in the Classic Cup and I just thought with a season under his belt he would come out and improve quite a bit. I thought he'd at least be a Group horse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In his early races this season he'd been racing quite well but was bumping into horses like Fifty Fifty and the four-year-olds coming up and I thought maybe he was just limited.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's not where I thought he'd be. I rode him last time and I just had to chase him too hard on the dirt over 1,200m and it just wasn't his go.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With California Whip now likely to get his chance at Group level, Callan is confident there is room for further improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is always a strong pace in the Hong Kong Macau Trophy and I knew going up to the 1,400m it was going to give me the chance to ride a race on him. It is what he's been needing and he did that,” Callan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hopefully that will give him a bit of confidence now and he can maybe try and sneak a Group race in the near future.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It might have been the Hong Kong Macau Trophy but it was a dismal showing from only the two Taipa raiders, with Krystrump and Kelowna Star filling the last two places.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Everything worked out perfectly for him today,” Cruz said, adding that he was always sceptical about the chances of Romantic Touch sweeping the interport series.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I said he should be in the first three, but I expected The Golden Age to do something but for Romantic Touch, he had no chance in this kind of ground. Only in Macau do you get a soft track.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The plan was to either lead or sit outside the leader and he jumped well but he had no speed and I couldn't push him around the field in a Class Five because if I used him up like that he wasn't going to finish,” Callan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So I left him alone and the pace kept coming back in my lap and when I got to the 1,200m I just thought ‘let him roll'.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think it was a race-winning move because he is quite a one-paced horse anyway. It was the right time to let him go and I just kept the momentum going and he just kept the gallop going.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market regulator and operator have signalled their reluctance to give their green light to an initial public offering (IPO) by the world's largest assembler of cryptocurrency mining equipment, while a regulatory framework is still being drafted to ring-fence the disruptive technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is premature for any cryptocurrency trading platform - or business associated with the industry - to raise funds through an IPO in Hong Kong before the proper regulatory framework is in place, according to two sources familiar with the matter, speaking to the South China Morning Post on condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reluctance by the regulator and market operator, which provide policy advice to the Listing Committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKEX), could be an insurmountable hurdle in the US$3 billion IPO application by </span><span class="s3">Bitmain Technologies</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest maker of cryptocurrency mining computers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It takes 556 days of computing and a hefty electricity bill to mine a single bitcoin. Is it worth it?[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/investment-products/article/2128518/it-takes-556-days-computing-and-hefty-electricity]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules provide for a closed-door hearing before the Listing Committee, which gives the final approval or rejection within six months of an application, after all questions are answered. If the applicant fails to hear from the Listing Committee after the six-month period, the listing lapses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokeswoman at the HKEX said the market operator could not speak about individual cases. </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (CICC), the sponsor of Bitmain's IPO, declined to comment. Bitmain's spokesman declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A rejection for Bitman's fundraising would be another blow to the nascent industry that now finds itself hemmed in by an increasing number of regulatory hurdles, as central banks and other financial regulators worldwide seek to exert control over the disruptive technological phenomenon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2013, Bitmain is the largest assembler of the data-hungry computers used for mining cryptocurrencies, and operator of mining collectives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its explosive growth from start-up to unicorn - a company exceeding US$1 billion in value - traced the 15-fold surge in bitcoin's value in 2017, which created a demand boom for Bitmain's Antminer computers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The size of conventional servers, Antminers are filled with dozens or hundreds of high-powered computer chips known as ASICs that crunch the data needed to verify cryptocurrency transactions. Their cheapest configuration starts from US$200 in Hong Kong[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2176180/bitcoin-mining-rigs-sale-steep-discounts-cryptocurrencies-crash], going up to several thousand dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/12/19/844d3938-0351-11e9-b0d2-cf4a0f50367e_image_hires_190315.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bitmain's first-half net income rose almost ninefold to US$742.7 million from a year earlier, while its revenue jumped almost 10-fold to US$2.8 billion during the same period, according to the company's IPO filing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More of a concern[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2160831/worlds-top-cryptocurrency-miner-may-be-losing-its-edge-analysts-say] to regulators and investors, the company held US$886.9 million worth of cryptocurrency assets at the end of June, or 28 per cent of total assets. That required the company to make “significant provisions” on inventories and cryptocurrency holdings because of the volatile prices, Bitmain said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bitmain's application came in the midst of new rules that are being drafted in Hong Kong for cryptocurrency trading platforms to work. Last year, the regulator and market operator pushed through the biggest reforms to Hong Kong's listing rules in three decades to allow technology companies and pre-revenue biotech research teams to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To keep pace with developments in financial technology, the SFC has created a so-called sandbox to test new rules that can allow these platforms to operate as licensed entities, and get new businesses in Hong Kong. It would therefore be premature for any company to sell stock in an IPO before the sandbox ends, as the regulatory framework may change in future, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/12/19/976d18a6-0362-11e9-b0d2-cf4a0f50367e_image_hires_190315.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Bitmain gets 94 per cent of its revenue from selling computer hardware, and does not operate as a cryptocurrency platform, the hurdle put up by the Hong Kong regulators underscores how any business related to virtual currencies could be swept under a broad category of alternative assets that are now subject to additional scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One idea under consideration is for only professional investors to be eligible to invest in these cryptocurrency assets, the SFC's chief executive Ashley Alder had said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, Bitmain isn't the first to have the door shut in its face.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trainer Caspar Fownes still regards Rainbow Chic's Hong Kong Derby defeat with chagrin but he was preferring to look ahead last night as the four-year-old showed how far he has come with victory in the Happy Valley Vase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mental game was holding back Rainbow Chic in his earliest days in Hong Kong and field shyness blamed for his close fourth in the Derby, but last night it mattered nothing to the gelding as he shrugged off a heavy bump forcing out of a pocket at the 200m to finish off powerfully. He's only just getting the hang of it all and we're going to see a lot more from him CASPAR FOWNES</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the Derby, you see him with other horses around him and he's looking at them and not concentrating on racing - I still think with clear room he'd have won it but he just wouldn't race when it got tight," Fownes said last night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"And what he did tonight, there's no way he'd have done that and have that sort of contact with another horse and then go through with it. He's a good horse, he's only just getting the hang of it all and we're going to see a lot more from him next season as he matures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rainbow Chic had been targeted towards last night's 1,800m Class One for some time, but was backing up from a solid Class Two second with 133 pounds on Sunday. "This was the race I wanted with him, he'd run well at Happy Valley the only other night he came here and I think the cushion in the track here suits him," Fownes explained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But when Pure Champion was put in this race, he compressed the weights and it changed the equation a bit for me. So I thought I'd run him on the weekend and back him up - if he won on Sunday, he'd have gone up in weight and Brett Prebble could ride him, if not I had Vincent to ride him on the light weight and he's given him a great ride."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Obviously the stewards panel thought so too, Ho escaping with only a reprimand for the incident in the straight, and the win gave the young rider a double for the card after scoring earlier for Tony Millard on True Courage, also part of a double for the trainer, who provided Zac Purton's only victory of the card.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Flying Unicorn just had his night tonight," Purton said after chipping Douglas Whyte's championship lead to only two wins. "He's been racing well and he's often there around them but he needs it all to go right and tonight he sneaked one - it was a plus to be up on the speed which is his natural style."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Matthew Chadwick had been dumped on the track on the weekend by California Dude on the way to the gates for a race and missed his final rides, but bounced back straight away with a win for Derek Cruz on new Class Five acquisition Starlit Warrior and later added Beauty Sparkle for Tony Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he was not as fortunate as others in the stewards' room, getting a three-day ban and $80,000 fine for careless riding on Tres Magnifique in the third race. It was Chadwick's seventh suspension this season but at least he had the winners to take away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beauty Sparkle felt good going to the start and he had gate one, a big plus tonight, and won well but he isn't very robust," Chadwick said. "Maybe he can still improve next season if he can strengthen up a bit."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starlit Warrior had been 18 starts without a placing under Andy Leung Ting-wah, but was able to win at the first time of asking for Cruz and Chadwick said there was still room for advancement off his 14 rating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He was on and off the bridle, very green and awkward," he said. "He's limited but if he can learn to run straight, he'd have to win another race off such a low rating."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia is becoming one of the focal points for global investors and Chinese technology conglomerates looking to expand outside their home market. The region's diversity and population have made it both an attractive and difficult target to crack.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Typically defined as the region east of India, west of New Guinea, north of Australia and south of China, Southeast Asia is home to some 655 million people in 11 countries that range from a city-state like Singapore to archipelagic nations like Indonesia and the Philippines, to landlocked Laos, speaking different languages and practising different religions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's largest hi-tech companies have made forays into the region, with </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> buying the Southeast Asian e-commerce firm </span><span class="s3">Lazada Group</span><span class="s1"> and signing cooperation deals with Malaysia and Thailand. </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, the gaming-and-social media giant, has invested in Singapore-based Sea, which operates the Shopee e-commerce site and Garena gaming and esports platform. </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> led an investment round into Thai online fashion brand Pomelo last year, while the region's two biggest internet platform start-ups, Singapore's Grab and Indonesia's Go-Jek, count Chinese tech unicorns </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Meituan Dianping as investors, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia “is becoming a proxy war for large Chinese internet companies like Tencent, Alibaba and we think going forward this will increase”, said Hian Goh, who founded Openspace Ventures in 2014 and has invested in start-ups such as Go-Jek, Halodoc, Redmart and Chope. “Already, we see Go-Jek, our portfolio company, receive investments from </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> as well as </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">, and JD has done a joint venture with </span><span class="s3">Central Group</span><span class="s1"> in Thailand. We think a lot of the capital funding could come from these strategic sources as well as venture capital.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the increasing interest in Southeast Asia has boosted valuations, they are still more “reasonable” compared with Silicon Valley or China, according to several venture capitalists interviewed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There's a joke that start-ups in Silicon Valley would add a zero behind their asking price if they knew Chinese investors were interested because of their reputation for being willing to bet large sums of money,” said Grace Yun Xia, Singapore-based principal at Jungle Ventures, which is looking to raise US$200 million for a third fund targeted at Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Jungle Ventures</span><span class="s1">' strategy is to invest in start-ups that can solve problems endemic to the region, according to Xia, who was formerly the senior director of corporate strategy and investment at Tencent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consumer lending, fintech and payments should continue to be hot areas for investment because they are “pain points”, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financing for Southeast Asia's technology sector totalled US$6.3 billion across 422 deals last year, up from about US$300,000 for 100 deals in 2012, according to data from venture capital research service CB Insights. It recently reported that Hong Kong-listed Tencent, which runs China's largest video games and social media businesses, had been most active investing in North America from 2013 to March this year. In the same period, e-commerce giant Alibaba, along with affiliate Ant Financial Services, has focused on investing in the rest of Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the souring ties between the US and China, more investment interest may be redirected from Silicon Valley to other regions. US President Donald Trump hinted this week that he would restrict Chinese investments in the US[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2152645/donald-trump-says-he-favours-steven-mnuchins-path] through a government agency that has already derailed several proposed acquisitions over the past year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at a lunch with lawmakers in Washington, Trump said the </span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) </span><span class="s1">would help counter the acquisition of US companies that develop advanced technologies. </span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1"> is an inter-agency body that assesses the national security implications of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers that could result in foreign control of any US business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I just got off a call last night with yet another top unicorn in China,” said Khailee Ng, a managing partner at 500 Startups overseeing its Southeast Asia fund. “They redirected interest to Southeast Asia but also India. I haven't spoken to my contacts at other firms yet, but I would not be surprised.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A redirection of investor money into Southeast Asia would benefit start-ups looking to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the most prominent start-ups out of the region, by far, is Grab, which was established as a taxi-booking app in Singapore and Malaysia (its earliest names were </span><span class="s3">GrabTaxi</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">MyTeksi</span><span class="s1">, respectively), and is now in eight markets. Grab has telegraphed its ambitions to become a platform company and started a venture capital arm to back promising start-ups that it can integrate into its business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its rival, Go-Jek, is currently in fewer countries, but has more services than Grab on its booking app in Indonesia, from massages to home cleaning to filling pharmacy prescriptions. It, too, has announced plans to expand regionally, with Thailand and Vietnam as the first stops in its foray outside its home market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Historically what has been the biggest opportunities are copycat models - what has worked elsewhere … like the US and China - transplanted over here,” said Ng, who has invested in Grab. “There are still pockets of business models that can be replicated and are not done very well in Southeast Asia, specifically within fintech.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On the horizon of trends for start-ups that we're betting on is deep tech,” he said. “We see Southeast Asia as a market ready to accept solutions that come from life sciences, energy, big data, artificial intelligence and even from space.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Southeast Asia remains relatively under-represented in terms of start-ups with the potential to scale up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Thailand, the entire start-up scene began taking off only three years ago in 2015, according to Robert Lomnitz, director of Bangkok Venture Club, a network of investors, entrepreneurs and executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And because many of the Southeast Asian countries are mobile-first markets, they have skipped the progression seen in more mature markets, Lomnitz said. This has also meant that the mobile network operators in Thailand have been incubating the start-ups to look for content and mobile apps that they can use, whereas in other more developed markets, the incumbents typically are the ones being disrupted and challenged by start-ups, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Literally it went from writing things on a piece of paper to a 4G network in almost no time,” Lomnitz said. “That makes the market very different from historical early-stage markets, so I think it will be quicker, the growth of all of this … Business models are different and the approach needs to be a little different as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All the investors and entrepreneurs that the South China Morning Post spoke with over the past month from around the region said the diversity in this large market was both a competitive advantage for local players and a defensive moat against external players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Tan Yinglan, founding managing partner of Insignia Venture Partners, Southeast Asia has just started the second half of a metaphorical football match.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the first half, the platform companies in e-commerce, ride-hailing and game publishing have been established,” said Tan, who has invested in start-ups such as used-car marketplace Carro and co-working space EVHive. “In the second half, where the models involve local operations and are transactional, it would be challenging for these players to build their own operations in Southeast Asia, and we believe that they are more likely to make strategic investments or acquisitions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opportunities are in industry segments such as automobiles, property, logistics, health care, education, Tan said. He is steering clear of areas like live-streaming, news-reader apps and other asset-light businesses where Chinese players as well as the likes of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are competing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increasing interest in Southeast Asia means that valuations inevitably are heading up. While that is good news for entrepreneurs, it also means the risks and expectations for start-ups among investors are higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Valuations in Southeast Asia are “much more reasonable at the lower levels, at the higher level, when you're raising half a billion dollars, you're playing on the global stage, it's the same globally,” said Ong Peng Tsin, managing partner of technology fund Monk's Hill Ventures and co-founder of Match.com. “My personal opinion is that there's too much money floating around.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For some investors [they think] ‘If I invest money and I lose money, I don't make money. If I don't invest money, I don't make money. So the only way I make money is if I invest it.' So usually investors don't care what the risk is, they'll invest,” Ong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So you're seeing all these billion of dollars pumped into the global PE tech market. If the companies can keep up, that's OK, but not all of them can keep up.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen Zhang, founder and chief executive of Beibei.com, China's largest online shop specialising in mother and baby products, expects businesses to more than double in 2017, buoyed by the company's expanded supply chain and enriched product offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou-based Beibei plans to achieve gross merchandise volume (GMV) sales of 10 billion yuan in 2017, up from this year's 4 billion yuan after it became profitable in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gross merchandise volume (GMV) is a standard often used by e-commerce companies to measure sales growth. The metric tallies the value of transactions processed on the online platforms, which counts in the orders cancelled by buyers later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We'll see difficulties in taking each step ahead from now on," Zhang said. "We want to make our supply chain stronger, give customers better experience and fine-tune product offerings to support fast business growth."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beibei, established in 2014, is a "unicorn" - unlisted technology firms valued at more than US$1 billion that receives investment from a clutch of renowned venture capital funds including IDG and Capital Today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang, 30, is among the mainland's rising business stars. He has a Master's of Engineering Degree and had a brief work stint with e-commerce juggernaut </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> between 2009 and 2011, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After Beibei eked out a profit, I felt entirely relieved since we can do many things at our own will," said Zhang. "We are in the second half of a game in which we will chase a larger scale of the businesses based on profitable model."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's market for mother and baby products is estimated to hit 2 trillion yuan this year, according to consultancy iResearch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online transactions of mother and baby products are valued at about 300 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Beijing ended the decades-long one-child policy last year to encourage adults to have a second child, the market has been increasingly viewed as attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beibei's ultimate goal is to become a world-class e-tailer driven by the best technologies," Zhang said. "We will focus on the ‘mum economy', which is a mammoth market to tap."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists forecast that the second-child policy would lead to an additional 3 million newborn babies in China every year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said mainland startups are grappling with a "nuclear winter" this year after venture capitalists refrained from splashing out millions of dollars worth of backing to own a share of those technology firms perceived as future stars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mid-2016, Beibei completed the latest round of financing, raising US$100 million from a consortium of investors including New Horizon Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was among the few "unicorns" that received fresh capital from venture capital funds this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Zhigang, founder of online media group New Top 100 and a well-known writer about China's technology sector, said that efficient management of the supply chain held the key to online shopping success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The new economy is obviously an enhanced integration of online and offline operations," he said. "The scale of the supply chain in your hand decides the business volume that you can handle."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beibei sells both domestic and imported products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has overseas facilities in Hong Kong, Japan and the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is categorised as trailing giants such as Alibaba and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beibei wants to go it alone, and we don't want to be acquired by any bigger players," Zhang said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Venture capital (VC) investment in China's thriving new economy - based on the expanding use of smartphones - is becoming riskier, warns veteran investor Helen Wong, whose company joined the most recent financing round for one of China's highest-profile unicorns, the bike-sharing service Mobike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is not like before when growth was relatively easy for start-ups, when user numbers and activities were exploding in the mobile internet world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Nowadays with every one having more than 20 apps on their smartphone, it becomes harder to tempt new installations," said Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She was speaking at an alumni event held in Hong Kong by </span><span class="s3">INSEAD</span><span class="s1">, one of the world's leading and largest graduate business schools.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong's argument is backed up by a latest study from data provider QuestMobile, which</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">showed the number of active smartphone used in China grew from 1.03 billion to 1.06 billion in the first nine months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the month-on-month growth rate decreasing from 13.1 per cent in January to 7 per cent in September, which shows "demographic dividend depletion, while user growth in the mobile internet industry faces huge challenges".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global venture capitalists splashed out US$39 billion worth of investment in the third quarter, according to KPMG's Venture Pulse report for the period, with more than a quarter of that (US$10.2 billion) heading into China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's bike-sharing giants could merge to stop the cash burning[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2113100/chinas-bike-sharing-giants-could-merge-stop-cash-burning]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With online traffic still largely monopolised by a few industry giants such as Tencent, however, looking for new avenues of investment is becoming more challenging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors say they have been seeing much faster shifts in investor target areas, leading to several "mini cycles" taking place, Wong said, citing two typical examples: shared power banks, and mini KTV systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On October 11, Hangzhou-based power bank rental start-up LeDian announced it had shut down its business altogether and retrieved all its devices, while at the same time telling some existing users they might face difficulties withdrawing deposits due to an overload on its server.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's only six months ago that the shared power bank business triggered a rush in investment into similar ideas. In 10 days since late March, five start-ups in the sector pocketed a combined 300 million yuan (US$45.2 million) financing from 20 institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors have got to stay nimble and sober," Wong said, adding she believes there will be good opportunities in sectors in future such as the further integration of online and offline shopping, and the online entertainment market dominated by those born after 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's small power bank rental firms to be ousted in battle for market share[http://www.scmp.com/tech/social-gadgets/article/2099049/chinas-small-power-bank-rental-firms-be-ousted-battle-market]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since last year, Wong has led three rounds of investment by her firm Qiming into Mobike, which now values China's high-profile bike sharing firm at US$3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since late September there has been talk of a merger between the country's two leading bike sharers, Mobike and Ofo - itself another unicorn - but Wong believes both can successfully continue independently, but only by expanding their service offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In China, the tradition seems to be when you have two top players in an area, they merge. But it is not necessarily the case for Mobike and Ofo," Wong said.The ambitions of a company are always an interesting question - we definitely do not want to exit early if an entrepreneur is capable of growing their business bigger, even though he or she might not make any profit for yearsHelen Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's bike-sharing platforms, which enable users to pick up and dump bikes anywhere, any time, by scanning a code with their smartphone, has attracted a staggering US$2 billion in funding over the last 18 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the top of the tree are Mobike and Ofo. However, fierce prices wars have already forced out smaller competitors, leaving the realistic profitability of the two top players in question.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week saw the sector's biggest casualty yet, with the third biggest player Bluegogo - the Tianjin-based start-up that boasted 20 million registered users at its peak - going bust due to a shortage of cash and the strain of growing cutthroat competition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong's optimism for the two market leaders is based on their strong business expansion plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobike is now moving into car sharing, partnering with electric car-maker Xinte Electric, it said earlier this month, to launch a fleet of shared cars, dubbing "Mocars".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The ambitions of a company are always an interesting question - we definitely do not want to exit early if an entrepreneur is capable of growing their business bigger, even though he or she might not make any profit for years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"On the other hand, I have watched too many entrepreneurs insist on expanding their companies too quickly, which can often lead them to miss what many see as their ultimate goal: an IPO (initial public offering)," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said the US, Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets are all looking for different types of companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US investors like room for growth and are willing to invest for the future. The mainland market stresses earnings and profitability, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong is somewhere in between, with smaller internet companies with strong consumer bases and brand awareness having the best chance of success.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bar to compete in China's highly competitive premium car-hailing market, currently dominated by </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, was just raised after internet giant Baidu entered the fray by agreeing to provide a chauffeur service provider with funding and access to its artificial intelligence technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur, a Chinese car-hailing company backed by state-owned transport service group Beijing Shouqi Group, said on Monday it has raised an additional 1.3 billion yuan (US$196 million) from investors including Baidu and Chinese smart electric vehicle maker NIO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The amount includes 600 million yuan from a series B round led by China Minsheng Trust and 700 million yuan from a B+ round led by Baidu and NIO. Shouqi said the latest funding has propelled the two-year-old start-up to "unicorn" status - a private company with a valuation of more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi Chuxing plans to use this one advantage to crush its rivals in race for self-driving cars[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2083875/didi-chuxing-plans-use-one-advantage-crush-its-rivals-race-self]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The alliance is expected to intensify competition in China's premium chauffeur-driven car market, currently dominated by ride-hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> with an estimated 70 per cent share of rides.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wei Dong, chief executive of Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur, said the new investment was more than just a financial deal because Baidu and NIO are expected to help it build a new transport ecosystem that "combines capital, smart cars, artificial intelligence and quality service."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shang Guobin, deputy director of Baidu's autonomous driving division, said the company invested in Shouqi because it wanted a strong partner to commercialise its autonomous driving technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is still too early to say who will be the winner of China's ride-hailing market, especially with more and more consumers preferring quality chauffeur services," said Shang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following a strategic partnership inked between Baidu and Shouqi in late October, Wei said the two firms have been working to bring autonomous driving to China's roadways by 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These pilot projects will still have drivers to monitor the car but the idea is to give passengers a taste of what the future of transport would be like," he told the South China Morning Post in an interview last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi Chuxing, China's Uber, is building countrywide charging network to drive into EV future[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2118141/didi-chuxing-chinas-uber-building-countrywide-charging-network-drive]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, which ranks as the world's second largest start-up with a valuation of US$50 billion, has also been ramping up research into AI and environmentally-friendly mobility technology as it sees autonomous driving and green energy cars as the future of the ride-sharing business. In March the company opened a research lab in Silicon Valley, where it has been hiring local talent to work on technologies such as autonomous driving.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to consultancy Roland Berger, the size of the premium chauffeur car market in China is expected to grow to 500 billion yuan (US$75 billion) by 2020 from 7.7 billion yuan in 2015 as the service expands to smaller cities and as more consumers are willing to pay extra for better service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shouqi said its number of monthly active users has reached 2.4 million, still tiny compared with to more than 25 million per day for </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vietnam enjoys a complicated relationship with Chinese tourists, who make up a significant proportion of its international arrivals - in 2017, 4 million of the 12.9 million visitors hailed from its northern neighbour. Just last month, anti-China sentiment peaked in protests and calls for a code of conduct[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/travel/article/2151473/do-chinese-tourists-need-code-conduct-while] specific to visitors from the Middle Kingdom, although tensions appear to have cooled, with authorities such as Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Tourism hoping to triple the number of Chinese tourists it welcomes in just two years, according to a July 13 report in online newspaper VietnamNet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under fire now are not the tourists themselves, but rather the way that some of them travel - namely, on “zero-dong” tours. Run by Chinese-owned proxy companies, these are low-priced package deals aimed at budget travellers, renowned for injecting little into the local economy and recognisable by their busloads of tourists, who are often pressured into buying expensive gifts and services once on holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Vietnam, they are popular in the coastal province of Khanh Hoa, where Nha Trang is located; around Da Nang and Hoi An; and in Quang Ninh province, which is home to Halong Bay and border town Mong Cai, the entry point for many Chinese. Online newspaper Hanoitimes reported in March that authorities were closely observing tourism activities in Quang Ninh following the closure of a zero-dong company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent years, authorities in Thailand have attempted to put a stop to similar “zero-dollar[https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/2130551/chinese-zero-dollar-tour-companies-dodge-thai-crackdown-and]” or “forced shopping” tours, asserting that they tarnish the image of the country. The initial crackdown in October 2016 affected arrivals to the country. An article on Channel NewsAsia's online platform noted that Chinese visitor numbers dropped 12 per cent in the last quarter of 2016, compared to the same period the previous year. However, China remains the main source of international arrivals for Thailand by a significant margin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking to VietnamNet, Tu Quy Thanh, director of Ho Chi Minh City-based travel company Lien Bang Travelink, which specialises in the Chinese-speaking market, said that most Vietnamese travel agents in Ho Chi Minh City refuse to run zero-dong tours. Instead, they are targeting more affluent Chinese travellers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, the independent Chinese tourist is the unicorn of the travel industry, a near-mythical beast with unlimited spending power who is driven by a desire to experience something new and unique. However, recent trends suggest these travellers are not as rare as once imagined. China's increasingly well-travelled millennials are far less interested in package tours than previous generations, preferring to make their own way overseas, and everyone is trying to court them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 2016 report put together by </span><span class="s3">Skyscanner</span><span class="s1"> and UnionPay Smart on Chinese “free, independent travellers” showed that the majority were aged from 15 to 33, hailed from China's top-tier cities, enjoyed shopping while overseas and preferred destinations such as Thailand and Japan. Vietnam's tourism sector hopes that by clamping down on zero-dong tour operators it can make it onto that list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vietnam travel agency behind ‘nine-dash line' T-shirts closes down</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking of travel agencies that have fallen foul of Vietnamese authorities, Vietnam Aladin Travel and Trading, the company behind the tour attended by the controversial “nine-dash line” T-shirt-wearing Chinese tourists[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2146258/anger-vietnam-after-chinese-tourists-arrive-airport-wearing], was fined 42 million Vietnamese dong (US$1,817) and forced to suspend activities for nine months, according to a July 7 report on digital news portal VnExpress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Nha Trang-based company said it had paid the fine and that it would be ceasing activities owing to the long suspension period and “other issues”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lonely Planet's Best in Asia list features some surprises</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Travel guide company Lonely Planet recently published its Best in Asia list. Compiled by its “travel experts”, who, “combed the charming beach towns, scoured the cloud-snagging skylines and poked around the prehistoric temple complexes of the ever-changing Asian continent to bring you their recommendations”, the line-up is led by South Korea's second city, Busan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coming in at No 2 is Uzbekistan, once a prominent player on the Silk Road, which is now opening up to tourism, although Lonely Planet does note that it lags behind its neighbours in terms of human rights. The third spot is given to Vietnam's biggest and busiest metropolis, Ho Chi Minh City.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fifa World Cup in Russia saw the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) used for the first time in a final to award France a 38th-minute penalty. But this is not the only innovation to emerge from the worldwide event, as Shenzhen-based ultra-thin flexible display maker Royole also proved that watching soccer games on goods such as hats and clothes is now a reality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese company arranged for several spectators at the 2018 final between France and Croatia on Sunday to wear top hats equipped with its flexible display broadcasting the soccer final live. The flexible sensor technology incorporates a high-definition 2K resolution bended display which streams content from a user's mobile phone or tablet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole has also developed T-shirts embedded with its flexible displays, which means you can now watch TV on peoples' clothes or use them as walking advertising billboards. Washing the clothes is not a problem as the displays and related circuitry can be easily removed from the T-shirts and top hats before cleaning, said the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Flexible displays are seen by many as one of the key future trends for mobile electronics, with a number of top smartphone makers including South Korea's </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1"> believed to be readying the launch of flexible displays that will allow for the commercial production of “foldable” phones in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Future phones: foldable like a napkin, with up to nine cameras and able to charge over thin air[https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2153937/future-phones-foldable-napkin-nine-cameras-and-able-charge-over-thin-air]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tricked-out T-shirts and top hats are not cheap though, costing 5,888 yuan (US$882) each or 8,888 yuan for a combo deal, according to Royole's website. The items are also on limited offer only and won't be shipped until November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flexible displays are attached to a small external power supply than can be recharged multiple times, with a usage time of about 10 hours supported by a 10,000 mAh (milliampere hour) power bank, said Jason Fan, a vice-president of Royole.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The display embedded on hats and clothes is light, thin, soft and rich in colour, making it good for daily wear,” said Fan, adding that it can be applied to a wider range of uses, such as intelligent transport, smart homes and robotic products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole, a Chinese unicorn valued at more than US$3 billion after raising US$800 million in its fourth and biggest round of funding from a group of heavyweight investors, was founded in August 2012 in Silicon Valley, Hong Kong and Shenzhen. In 2014, it released the world's thinnest 0.01mm full-colour bendable and rollable screen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, founded by CEO Bill Liu Zihong, began operations at its 1.1-million-square-foot production campus in Shenzhen in early June this year. The plant will mass produce its fully flexible displays, which can be bent, folded or curled, for commercial use.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies chairman, Francis Leung Pak-to, also known as “father of red chips” said on Monday that the chamber supported the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed separate board to list dual class share companies here, but not new start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has just ended a consultation last Friday for the third board's establishment, whose listing requirements differ from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, essentially aimed at providing a listing venue for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two platforms: a premium market that is open to all investors and will host companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but have a dual-class share structure which the exchange currently disallows. The second is for start-ups where only professional investors can invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung was opposed to the start-up board for the high risks that entailed. “Many start-ups lack track records and have a high risk of failure. They are not suitable to be traded on the stock exchange,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He supported however, the launch of a separate board only for the dual class shares with a market capitalisation of HK$8 billion, which is similar to a so-called unicorn new economy firm valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list here,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are plenty of mainland “unicorns” which would be interested to list in Hong Kong, but our market needs to prepare itself for these companies. This is why we would need this new board that accept dual class share companies to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many big technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are dual class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than the others. Hong Kong bans such types of companies to list but US allows it, which has led mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to go for a listing in New York in 2014, instead of Hong Kong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list hereFrancis Leung Pak-to, Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Three years after losing Alibaba and our market still has done nothing to address the issue. We need to make sure our market can capture these companies to list. This is why we need to introduce the third board soon,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I introduced the red chips in Hong Kong in the 1990s, there were many criticisms that these companies are different from other H-shares. But then, we have many successful listings - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Citic, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> - and they are still heavily traded by investors,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A red chip is a company incorporated in Hong Kong but has a mainland parent, which is different from an H-share company which is established in the mainland but listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also against the HKEX's proposal to let US-listed mainland companies seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This rule will turn Hong Kong into a second-tier market as most big players will go list in the US and then seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. We oppose to this proposal,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> has opposed to dual class share listings as they reduce the ability for fund managers to exercise their voting rights to decide on the remuneration, director appointments and other important corporate affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund body said the development of dual class shares were “negative” to investor protection and urged the exchange to stick to “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly getting flattened at the start and being stopped in his tracks may have been the best thing that happened to Holyangelholy last start, as it forced the four-year-old into a more relaxed racing pattern and left him in a perfect position to sprint home in a suitably fast-run event.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holyangelholy had been disappointing from a purely on-paper performance stand-point - starting short in the market in each of his six previous starts. But after that confidence-building last-start win, it seems the gelding is now ready to do what John Size-trained horses regularly do: progress through the grades - starting with the opening leg of Sunday's Triple Trio at Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six points for a three-quarter length win keeps Holyangelholy in Class Four. He has drawn barrier one and Douglas Whyte returns to the saddle, but what appeals most is the promise of another genuinely run race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My Memory (Ben So Tik-hung) is back up in grade and, while he may struggle with that, he will still get out and run. Regency Champion (Matthew Chadwick) is a chance to come over and create pressure from barrier 10, and possibly first-starter Gratified (Olivier Doleuze), who travelled keen in his last trial, could get in the on-pace mix.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sitting back at the tail is another backmarker waiting for the right race, the Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained Why Not (Howard Cheng Yue-tin). He progressed through distances up to a mile in his first season, but there was nothing wrong with his first run over 1,200m on debut. After Alvin Ng Ka-chun fell off Why Not when he was resuming over 1,400m in September, that might also have been a blessing, as he now steps back in trip.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One to watch is John Moore's first-starter Hit A Home Run (Tim Clark). He has had limited exposure with just two trials, but he looks a real natural and has drawn ideally in four. It wouldn't surprise for him to run in the first three. Throw in Regency Champion from the on-pace brigade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the middle leg, bank on How Speedy (Richard Fourie) getting better luck from a wide gate this time round after he was stuck on a limb facing the breeze last start.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How Speedy was three-and-four deep with no cover but managed to stick on to finish second to subsequent Class Three winner Little Cow, and breeding suggests the step up to 1,400m suits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elegant Frames (Weichong Marwing) may have got the soft-as-butter run last time out, but there is no reason why he won't get something similar again from gate three, and he, too, will be suited by the extra ground third-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One Of A Kind (Whyte) has drawn one and must be included, while consideration should be given to last-start Class Five winner Able Magic (Derek Leung Ka-chun) and Winning Bear (Brett Prebble).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the final leg, go without a banker and play narrow - but the Richard Gibson-trained Always Something (Olivier Doleuze) is an option as stand-out. He should win a race soon after finally finding his way back into Class Four.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">King Haradasun (Whyte) looked disappointing on face value last start, but the progression to 1,600m at his third run in is what he needs and barrier six is not too bad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Others to include are David Hall-trained Surrounded (Prebble), who continues to surprise but has again drawn wide, and Caspar Fownes' Blossom Daily, who was heavily backed when winning last start and drops into gate one.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> Dianping, one of China's most valuable private tech firms, is gearing up to challenge the monopoly of ride hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, a move almost certain to trigger a new price war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">, known as the Chinese </span><span class="s3">Yelp</span><span class="s1"> for its online-to-offline business model offering services from restaurant reviews, food delivery, movie ticketing and travel bookings, is expected to launch a national expansion of its ride-hailing business after debuting the service in Nanjing city in December, according to a </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> employee familiar with the plans who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The employee confirmed that the company will soon launch ride-hailing services in at least five cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen in south China's Fujian province.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A warrior's oath has been sworn at internal meetings,” said the source, referring to a motivational technique to spur employees to battle it out for the ride hailing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Services （in several cities）are slated to kick off by the end of this month,” said the source.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> declined to comment on its ride hailing expansion plans, which were reported earlier by Tencent News.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi, which counts tech giants Apple, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings among its biggest shareholders, has been the dominant player in China's ride-hailing market after pushing </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> out of the country in 2016. Didi and Uber engaged in a destructive price war for dominance in China, with billions of yuan invested to buy loyalty from riders and drivers, effectively giving consumers free rides to win market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Didi and Uber splurged money to cultivate user habits, and by coming to the market late we can save this cost,” the </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> source said. “As Didi begins to profit by charging a higher commission from drivers, we stand to gain public favour.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ride-hailing king channels Genghis Khan in preparation for a new price war [http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2126196/chinas-ride-hailing-king-channels-genghis-khan-preparation-new]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> raised US$4.1 billion in its latest funding round in October, providing a war chest for future investment in existing businesses and new business development. The company's private valuation of US$30 billion puts it behind Uber, </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Xiaomi, and ahead of </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, as the world's fourth most valuable unicorn, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a strong player such as </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> joining the nationwide ride-hailing market, a new price war is inevitable, said Zhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As a late mover in the market </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will need to invest money to make its name in the ride-hailing business, especially given Didi's well-established position in China,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> is reportedly offering drivers low commission fees and high bonuses to entice them over to its app, and incentives to lure consumers are set to follow, according to Zhao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The app for </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> drivers is ranked number 89 under the category of “tools”, according to iTunes China store, with user comments including posts such as “hoping </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will come to Xi'an city soon”, and “hoping </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will end the embarrassment of Didi being the sole player”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For its part, Didi is not afraid of the competition, according to its chief executive Cheng Wei. “Didi has withstood the fiercest competition in history, from Kuaidi to Uber. We have PK'ed countless rivals,” said Cheng, using local slang for beating an opponent in games. “</span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> may not be the weakest, but it may not be the strongest either,” he said in an interview with Chinese media outlet Caijing in January, the transcript of which was verified by Didi.</span></p>
