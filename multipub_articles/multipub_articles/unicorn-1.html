<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whether you are a child or an adult, you will probably agree that unicorns are a universally loved mythical creature. With unicorn make-up brushes, unicorn phone cases and unicorn accessories being all the rage, we went to try our hand at making some adorable unicorn cupcakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We headed over to Bakebe - a baking studio in Wan Chai that is fully stocked with all the ingredients anyone could ever need to create any kind of bakery masterpiece. It also has iPads with its own proprietary video tutorial app which provides amateur bakers with a step-by-step guide on how to make certain baked goodies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We started off by preheating the oven. The we headed over to their ingredients station to grab the materials we needed for the first part of this unicorn cupcake adventure - the cake batter ingredients. Once we had enough flour, butter, separated egg yolks, sugar, vanilla essence and milk, we were ready to begin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/13/97abc62e-9c46-11e8-9a20-262028f49e8a_image_hires_122042.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first step was to sift the flour to ensure that your cake will not be lumpy. Then we added the ingredients into a mixer in a specific order to create the creamiest cake batter possible. Once the batter was ready, we put it into a piping bag, to be squeezed into cupcake holders. The cupcakes were baked in the oven for 22 minutes, and then left on the cooling rack with fans for seven minutes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While waiting for the cupcakes to bake, we started on the rainbow icing that would later become the unicorn's head. First, we took three bowls of heavy cream and whipped it in a mixer. Then each bowl was mixed with a different food colouring - we picked pink, blue and yellow. The cream was laid out horizontally in three long lines on saran wrap, which was then folded together and put into a piping bag, ready to be squeezed onto the baked cupcakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/13/818c7bd6-9c46-11e8-9a20-262028f49e8a_image_hires_122042.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once the cupcakes were sufficiently cooled, we got right to work decorating them. This is where the video tutorial really helped, because you have to spiral the piping in a very specific way to get the icing to stand up perfectly, like the example from Bakebe.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After piping the tri-coloured icing onto all the cupcakes, we gathered ready made horns and ears and gently inserted them into the beautiful iced cupcakes.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They used to be the billion dollar start-ups. Now we call them unicorns, a term coined five years ago by Aileen Lee of Silicon Valley-based Cowboy Ventures. In mythology, unicorns are rare, beautiful creatures. It was the perfect name - until recently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now unicorn is taking on new meaning: start-ups that perpetuate the myth that they are worth a billion US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These days, it does not take much money to claim a US$1 billion valuation - under US$200 million in some cases. Nor do you have to be a leading edge or disruptive tech company. Many unicorns, especially those in China, are simply smartphone apps applied to businesses that have been around for decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 2017 China Unicorn Enterprise Development Report[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139684/heart-chinas-techno-nationalism-hit-list-200-unicorns] lists 164 Chinese unicorns worth a combined US$628 billion, compared to 132 in the US valued at more than US$700 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Who determines the value of a unicorn? Turns out it is the investors themselves. Online Chinese brokerage Tiger Brokers, backed by Wall Street guru Jim Rogers, said investors putting in US$80 million of C series funding last month determined a valuation of US$1.06 billion. That is despite a global equities slowdown, with Hong Kong stocks hitting a 10 month low last week and mainland Chinese market turnover at a four-year low. A Tiger spokesman did not immediately reply to a question on this matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's stock exchanges cede Asia crown to Japan as investors flee Chinese equities amid trade war[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2158093/china-loses-its-crown-worlds-no-2-stock-market-japan]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study of 135 US unicorns last year found that on average they were 48 per cent above fair value. Nearly half should have been valued at less than US$1 billion, and 13 were more than 100 per cent above, according to researchers at Stanford and the </span><span class="s3">University of British Columbia</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the reasons cited for the over valuations were the strings that investors attach to their money. IPO return guarantees were offered to investors by 15 per cent of the US unicorns and seniority over all other investors were given to one third of them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There does not appear to be much, if any, research on “fair” valuations of Chinese unicorns, but venture capitalists generally agree that valuations in China are a lot higher than their US counterparts. This is usually justified by China's faster growth rates and a population of 1.4 billion people - although only 55 per cent have internet access. With data touted as the “new oil”, Chinese unicorns also pitch themselves as valuable sources of consumer spending patterns, though in the long term people may be less willing to trade their personal data for free or subsidised products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The “huge market” advantage argument does not hold up in some cases. Luckin Coffee, a Chinese cafe chain that promises door-to-door deliveries within 20 minutes, claimed unicorn status after a US$200 million investment round this month, yet on average mainland Chinese only drink 4.5 cups of coffee per annum[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2157391/starbucks-said-deliver-coffee-tie-alibabas-eleme] versus 269 for US consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin Coffee said its valuation was mutually agreed to by the company and its investors. “We can prove its soundness with future performance,” a Luckin spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One group of unicorns that leveraged the billion-plus population to gain funding were the dockless bike sharing companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dozens sprang up two years ago, but after burning through billions of dollars, what's left is the wreckage (literally) of hundreds of thousands of bikes thrown into rivers and abandoned on streets - and three players that account for more than 90 per cent the market. [To see where a large part of that money ended up, check out these aerial photographs of the “bicycle graveyards”[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2156975/chinas-bike-sharing-bubble-has-burst-drone] in China, published in SCMP Post Magazine].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the billions invested, none of the Chinese bike sharing companies have made a profit. Consolidation was only a matter of time, with Mobike being bought by internet conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Meituan-Dianping</span><span class="s1"> in April for US$2.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Artificial intelligence, a much hyped technology more accurately described as machine learning in its current stage, has given some start-ups the opportunity to boost valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At CES 2017, UBTech Robotics described itself as an intelligent humanoid robot company. A year later, the Chinese company was “a robotics and AI company”. Four months later UBTech was touting “the single largest funding round ever for an artificial intelligence company” after raising US$820 million with a market valuation of US$5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Emailed inquiries sent to UBTech's marketing department and public relations firm were not immediately answered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, a unicorn's true value is only determined when it is sold - either through an IPO or to a third party buyer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which briefly held the title of world's most valuable unicorn a few years ago, launched an IPO in Hong Kong last month with a valuation of US$47 billion, well below the US$100 billion it initially expected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEO and founder Lei Jun pitched Xiaomi as an “internet” company, even showing a slide during an IPO briefing where smartphone sales were lumped under “internet sales”. Investors, as well as Chinese securities authorities, did not buy it. They saw a “hardware” company which derived 90 per cent of its revenue from hardware. Lei tried to justify his stance by calling Xiaomi a “new species”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spin is often used by entrepreneurs to hype the value of their start-up but the practice has reached epic proportions with the high stakes race to reach the magical billion dollar valuation. A similar thing happened in Silicon Valley in the late 1990s when businesses from pets to grocery deliveries slapped a dot.com on the end of their name and saw their valuations soar. One key difference: the dot-coms were publicly listed, so nervous investors dumping shares contributed to the inevitable market crash, whereas unicorns are backed by private money seeking an IPO as their exit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With artificial intelligence overhyped and the sharing economy old hat now, what's a budding unicorn to do? Thankfully, there's a new buzz word to help. The number of Chinese companies with “blockchain” in their name soared in the first seven months of the year, with 4,000 registered to July 16 - six times as many compared to the entire year before. In comparison, the US has only 817 “blockchain” companies - about a fifth of the number in China. In the first quarter, 41 per cent of all Chinese start-ups that received funding were blockchain related.[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2142962/chinas-local-governments-ramp-blockchain-projects-amid]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2142962/chinas-local-governments-ramp-blockchain-projects-amid]Entrepreneurs and investors better hurry though. When the curtain is pulled back on the unicorn myth, it may reveal they were just ponies with fake horns.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 6.5 percent of issued shares are open to the public offering. Markets expect that the minimum investment to buy one board lot will be HK$6,000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local media reported that Good Doctor, which enjoys a valuation of up to HK$80.3 billion, is to set its initial public offering price range at between HK$60 to HK$70. However, the unicorn could record loss until 2021.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors are ready to welcome this hot stock, and seven brokers say they have prepared HK$61.2 million margin financing for customers. In particular, Bright Smart Securities (1428) says frequent visitors have booked over HK$10 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Chinese conglomerate-backed company, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, is expected to list both in Hong Kong and mainland China, although the specific timeline has still not yet been decided. The Alibaba-backed technology company is expected to become the world's biggest super unicorn firm, after being valued by enthusiastic investors at around US$150 billion (HK$1.17 trillion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ant's biggest and best-known business is Alipay, which records 450 million active users. Ant also provides wealth management products and offers small loans and credit scores, among other ventures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A creature that has recently been recognized as part of local cultural heritage is now being exhibited at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Plaza.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese unicorn, or qilin, is one of the four benevolent animals in Chinese culture, along with the dragon, tortoise and phoenix.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with lion dancing, qilin dancing is rather low key. But a few New Territories' villagers keep this tradition alive during festivals, celebrations or weddings. Qilin dancing was recently recognized as being part of Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To raise its profile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Heritage Museum</span><span class="s1"> commissioned local paper-crafting master Kenneth Mo to create three qilin figure sets and a three- meter-high lantern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All these are now on display at the Lantern Carnival until next Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mo grew up in Kwu Tung Village in Sheung Shui, where he was introduced to qilin at an early age. He grew fond of the tradition, and followed a master to learn qilin dancing at the age of 19.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He later studied paper-crafting techniques under another master to learn to create the qilin dancing sets.</span></p>

ALOG also helps T-mall Global's cross-border logistics operations. In 2016, ALOG's revenue amounted to 1.49 billion yuan (HK$1.86 billion). Alibaba is its second largest shareholder.

They will be the first batch of internet and technology companies that will have dual listings.Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings (0700) may not figure in this first batch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Because of the stock connect schemes between Hong Kong and China, Tencent sees no immediate need to seek an A-shares market listing, according to reports.The A-shares market is the best listing venue for the mainland's unicorn companies, according to mainland media Securities Times, which cited Yang Shengjun, executive director of Shenzhen-based private equity firm Co-Stone Capital.Some of these companies are engaged in specialized sectors, including national security, Yang said.Start-ups with a valuation of US$1 billion or more are regarded as "unicorns."Hurun Greater China Unicorn Index said 33 new "unicorns" including 13 "super unicorns" emerged in the Greater China region in the first quarter of this year, taking the total of such start-ups to 151.During the period though, no "unicorns" were created in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Among the 33 newly-created "unicorns," Tencent Music has the highest valuation of 150 billion yuan, followed by JD Logistics, valued at 70 billion yuan.The report also revealed that 10 new "unicorns" are in the internet industry and the 13 so-called "super unicorns" have a valuation exceeding US$10 billion.In other IPO action, Singapore-based contractor HKE Holdings saw its retail tranche oversubscribed 788 times.The company priced its shares at 55 HK cents, the upper limit of its price range of between 45 HK cents and 55 HK cents. It plans to raise HK$84 million. Trading of its shares will start today.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are more than 10 such new-economy companies and he has already met with officials of some of the firms, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined however to identify them, but said a number have large-scale operations.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After years in the trenches doing research in artificial intelligence, Xu Li says his aha moment came in 2014 when he saw a strong case to create a business with a group of long-standing academic colleagues from the </span><span class="s3">Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They formed SenseTime Group at the Hong Kong Science Park that same year, quickly turning it into the world's hottest AI company[http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2116194/hong-kongs-sensetime-teams-qualcomm-extend-ai-more-devices] and the city's first hi-tech "unicorn" — a start-up valued at U$1 billion or more — a month ahead of GoGoVan[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2108658/gogovan-become-hong-kongs-first-us1-billion-start-after-merger-58].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As academics, we knew the powerful tool that we had developed," company chief executive Xu told the South China Morning Post. "When combined with huge volumes of data, our deep learning algorithm helps us establish applications which can surpass human performance, such as in facial recognition."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deep learning, a subset of a broader family of so-called machine learning technologies, is concerned with algorithms that teach computers to learn by example and perform tasks based on classifying various data, including images, sound and text.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu, 35, says he was taken back by the pace of the company's growth since launch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We expected to have an impact in the industry, but we never imagined how fast we would take off," said Xu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SenseTime now has more than 400 customers and strategic partners, including China Mobile[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=941&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, Meitu[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1357&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], graphics processor maker </span><span class="s3">Nvidia</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1">, JD Finance, </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1">, and mainland smartphone giants </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Selfie apps provider Meitu, microblog operator Weibo and Xiaomi use advanced facial recognition systems enabled by SenseTime's deep learning algorithm. Huawei also uses image recognition technology supported by SenseTime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1"> contracted SenseTime to develop its facial, image and text recognition applications. SenseTime also works with the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute to develop the mainland's citizen network identity infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We first explored mainland China because of the explosive demand in the market, where there is a huge population and big amounts of data being collected," said Xu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A graduate of </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</span><span class="s1"> who later obtained his PhD from CUHK in 2010, Xu said SenseTime's expertise in facial recognition technology led venture capitalists to invest in the company. It now has about 20 different investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SenseTime's first major funding round was in December last year, when its raised US$120 million from investors that included Beijing-based CDH Investments, conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">IDG Capital Partners</span><span class="s1"> and Star VC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July this year, the company completed its US$410 million Series B round of funding from investors led by CDH and Sailing Capital. The deal vaulted it to unicorn status with a US$1.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While many reports have identified SenseTime as a mainland company, Xu said the research done in Hong Kong and the opportunities on the mainland helped it "grow rapidly and become the first tech unicorn" in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corp chief executive Albert Wong Hak-keung said SenseTime has inspired other local tech start-ups to aim high, just like what the company's 11 co-founders did.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of China's largest online crowdsourcing platforms, created a decade ago by a veteran journalist and backed by its local government, is seeking another round of funding a year after its last, with the aim of becoming a “unicorn” company and floating next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhubajie.com, which claims more than 16 million users, announced just 12 months ago it had secured 1.6 billion yuan in C-round financing from Cybernaut (China) Investment, a Beijing-based venture capital firm that focuses on technology, and another 1 billion yuan in backing from the government of the Liangjiang New Zone in Chongqing, where the company is based.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now valued at 11 billion yuan, Zhubajie is looking for another round this year with plans to go public on the mainland by 2017, according to the zone's Bureau of Science and Technology Innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yang Chunlin, the director of the bureau, said its efforts to help Zhubajie become a unicorn company - defined as a start-up valued more than US$1 billion - were aimed at building a successful model to attract high-growth tech companies across the country to locate in the city to boost the region's tech industry and economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the new investment of 2.6 billion yuan, the company hopes to transform from a so-called “witkey website” into a “super incubator” to stimulate entrepreneurship and encourage business start-ups in 35 mainland cities this year, expanding to 100 cities in over 10 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Witkeys provide an online service where customers can use their intelligence, knowledge, abilities, and experience to earn income by solving problems for other people or companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Established in 2006, Zhubajie has been the country's leading witkey for years and its business model is unmatched by any domestic or overseas counterparts, and is impossible to imitate,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">according to Zhu, because of what he describes as its specially designed business modes to attract customers.I always believed the platform would be unique and valuable one day because it has helped more than one million SMEsZhubajie founder and CEO Zhu Mingyue</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhubajie was created by Zhu Mingyue, a former reporter for state-run newspaper Chongqing Evening Post, as an intermediary to connect mainly small and medium sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs to a wide range of service providers, including software developers, graphic designers, web designers, translators, and interior decorators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Zhubajie was far from successful in its first nine years between 2006 and 2014,” said Zhu, now its CEO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was very time-consuming to forge a valid platform and attract active users, and we had been relying on commission fees from transactions to survive</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But I always believed the platform would be unique and valuable one day because it has helped more than one million SMEs to design their logos and websites in the past decade, as well as offering thousands of individual designers full-time jobs through transactions on the platform each year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu added millions of designers and creators across the country have registered on Zhubajie, and many have started their own workshops and even companies based on trades via the platform.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It means Zhubajie is not only a trading platform but also an incubator for startup companies that grow on the rising deals from the platform,” said Zhu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The revenue of one of its startup clients, generated through trades on Zhubajie, is expected this year to reach 100 million yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That's very impressive. Could you find another incubator park to hatch up to 10,000 startups each year?” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, China's State Council pledged to provide a more supportive environment for innovation and entrepreneurship in order to power more sustainable growth and generate jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration for Industry and Commerce</span><span class="s1"> said in January 2015, that 10,600 new companies were being set up each day, since March of 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The number of individual startups in various sectors has been soaring across the country since early 2015. We spotted the great opportunities from these newly built SMEs, as every startup needs services like brand design, trademark registration, accounting taxes and profits, recruitment, and so on,” said Zhu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He decided to stop charging a one-off commission fee from each transaction, but turn to generating profits from expanding his service catalogue for new startups into trademark registration, financial advice, office design, recruitment, administrative support and printing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, we set up an 800-strong team to help domestic startups process their trademark registration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now we are the biggest trademark registration agent in the country, with 2,000 orders every day” Zhu said, “which means we could have up to 800 million yuan in revenue from the service.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The platform's annual volume of transactions reached about 3.5 billion yuan in 2014 and 7.5 billion yuan in 2015, and is expected to reach 20 billion this year, according to Zhu.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The business continues to benefit from local authority innovation incentives and funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yang Chunlin said the Liangjiang New Zone introduced four other local Internet companies to Cybernaut (China) Investment, before it finally chose to invest in Zhubajie last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We also invested 1 billion yuan in the platform, under our project to invest in and then incubate several startups towards becoming unicorn companies in various emerging industries in Chongqing,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Zone has earmarked funds of up to 25 billion yuan to boost local technology innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides Zhubajie, our district government has also invested in other startups involved in big data, e-commerce and telecommunication.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now many of them are worth between a hundred million yuan and US$ one billion, and some have the potential to be another unicorn,” Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are very happy with Zhubajie's achievements and hope its success could become a model for high-growth tech and internet companies across the world.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu said the company has signed strategic partnership with a total of 35 local governments across China to help them boost startups and entrepreneurship, such as Changsha in Hunan province, Kunming in Yunnan province, Tianjin and Guangzhou in Guangdong, and the investment cash will help it potentially create more links.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In cooperation with local governments, we plan to build and operate incubator parks for local SMEs and establish a VC fund to support local startups,” Zhu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This venture capital funding will allow Zhubajie to become China's biggest servicing platform for startups and SMEs, with a national network of online platforms and offline incubators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“2015 is just a beginning.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cash flow? Revenue? Gross merchandise volume? Forget about them, the thing most valued by China's tech entrepreneurs, and their bankers, is how much the company resembles a “unicorn”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The term “unicorn” - referring to start-ups worth at least US$1 billion - is becoming the hottest buzzword in China's business sector after Beijing used the term in context of young companies with superior technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the authority gave the term a clearer definition on Friday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said two types of firms have been selected as “pilot firms” that will enjoy preferred listing policies, according to a set of new rules regarding prioritising certain company stock offerings, issued by the State Council, citing rules made by the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are, innovative firms with revenue of no less than 3 billion yuan (US$477.7 million) in the most recent year and a valuation of no less than 20 billion yuan, or companies with rapid growth in income, empowered by world-leading tech and research ability and those enjoying an advanced position in peer competition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers are being urged to submit initial public offering (IPO) materials for unicorn companies under a special fast track, said sources close to the CSRC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you engage in traditional manufacturing, sorry you have to join the queue of more than 600 candidates,” said a source.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But if you are engaged in strategic tech sectors, big congrats! Jump the queue and you can be on the bourse and trading in a month.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tianjin's new party chief, known for seizing reporter's recorder, among front runners in Politburo race[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2021920/tianjins-new-communist-party-chief-among-first-front]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the Lunar New Year, several major banks in China have set up specialised departments to handle the work flow, as well as research companies of interest in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Hangzhou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tianjin, a city neighbouring Beijing governed by Party chief Li Hongzhong, who is vocal in extolling the virtues of President Xi Jinping's policies, has backed the development of a campus-style “Unicorn Building”, designed to bring together firms engaged in the sharing economy, big data and deep learning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some critics worry, however, that the push to get companies listed on the stock market will not necessarily lead to sustained innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One concern is whether China's currency controls, designed to restrict outflows from the country to maintain stability of its exchange rate, would constrict how funds from capital raising activities can be put to use.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the set of new rules issued on Friday night, the authority stipulates that for overseas listed firms, proceeds raised by A-share offerings can be remitted to overseas markets in yuan or in foreign exchange through currency swaps on the mainland market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But based on China's track record on capital control, whether the capital remittance could be smooth and timely remains a question.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is a core issue that has been discussed by regulators and the founders at tech firms for a long time,” said Ding Lei, chairman of online gaming operator NetEase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ding is among a group of mainland Chinese entrepreneurs, including Robin Li from Baidu, and Richard Liu from </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, who have declared their willingness to list their companies on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, some analysts warn that a flurry of share offerings by unicorns, as well as those from Chinese firms listed in the US, will bring headwinds to the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gao Ting, head of China Strategy at </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1">, warned in a research note in March that an excess of fundraising activities could swamp the market and pressure sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, if the top four internet giants in China issued an additional 5 per cent of existing shares as Chinese Depositary Receipts, we estimate 373 billion yuan (US$59 billion) could be diverted from the A-share secondary market,” the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, the mainland recorded IPO and secondary offering proceeds of 1.7 trillion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Enabling onshore investors to access high-quality growth names more easily could also result in a potential increase in the market's risk appetite and potentially cause a sell-off in overvalued ChiNext stocks,” Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ChiNext, the Chinese version of </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, was introduced in Shenzhen in 2009 to help support the financing and development of start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A large number of China's leading tech companies have opted to list in either the US or Hong Kong, which have different listing requirements in key areas of shareholding structure and profitability requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the Chinese government continues to gear up for what's increasingly looking like its “techno-nationalism” push, officials are believed to have created a hit list of some 200 top firms, that it hopes to see listed on mainland bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with a set of new rules issued by the State Council, China's cabinet, on Friday evening that focused on regulating Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs) offering by overseas listed tech giants like Alibaba, a campaign by Beijing is in full swing to get its most innovative companies listed on the home market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the country's Party leaders, regulators, and bankers, alike, are actively now knocking on their doors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts have reservations on whether such a frenzied push will result in the desired sustained levels of innovation, or prove to be just a short-lived gold rush, led by opportunists.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firms themselves, they add, could also face what for many is becoming a moral dilemma: a tough choice between political duty, and the sound economic reasoning needed before taking the big step to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing fast tracks foreign-listed Chinese tech firms' A-share flotation with CDR system launch[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139703/beijing-fast-tracks-foreign-listed-chinese-tech-firms-share]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In its attempt to establish the next generation of tech ‘unicorns' [start-ups worth more than US$1 billion], China has ironically injected nationalism into its development process,” says Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But America's innovation advantage actually results from the freedom it offers, via its capital markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guan Qingyou, head of the Rushi Institute of Finance, a respected research body based in Beijing, adds the temptation to court favour with Beijing may be very alluring, but he also questions its value.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When certain companies become favoured by the government, all the best resources tend to flock to them. But it directly turns smart money into dumb money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Follow the government line rather than business sense is not encouraging innovation - in fact it actually harms it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council on Friday issued a new set of rules on CDR offerings in the mainland market, specially designed for “innovative firms”, in a bid to boost a “strategic industry upgrading”, it said in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar to an ADR (American Depositary Receipt), CDRs are traded on the A-share market and represent securities in a company incorporated outside mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities regulator has created them with the sole purpose of allowing overseas-listed Chinese companies and unicorns to list at home, while allowing them to bypass existing restrictions, such as putting a prohibition on variable interest entity (VIE) structures and multiple share classes, and the requirement to have an unblemished track record of profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A week ago, a joint study issued by a Ministry of Science and Technology affiliate and a Beijing-based consultancy issued the2017 China Unicorn Enterprise Development Report,showing China now has 164 unicorns, worth a combined US$628.4 billion, which has galloped well ahead of the US by number.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most recent US figures suggest there were 132 unicorns based there at the end of 2017, valued at more than US$700 billion, from just US$35 billion in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's top 10 all claim individual valuations of more than US$10 billion - companies that are now being dubbed “decacorns”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's a list that reads like a veritable who's who of the country's premier e-commerce giants: </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s finance arm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, taxi hailer </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, smartphone heavyweight Xiaomi, Alibaba Cloud, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> Dianping, a group buying website for locally found consumer products and retail services, CATL Battery, Toutiao.com, Cainiao, Lufax and Jiedaibao, an online platform only launched in 2014 to link lenders with borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba owns theSouth China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> took the crown with a valuation of US$75 billion, while Didi and Xiaomi were placed second and third with US$56 billion and US$46 billion valuations, respectively. Most of those top ten have seen big jumps in valuation in the past two years especially.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chart of the day: Start-ups leading the unicorn league in China[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2137933/chart-day-leading-chinas-unicorn-league-china]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The study says Alibaba invested in the most unicorns incubated in 2017 among Chinese tech giants, with a total of 29 start-ups it backed making the list, followed by Tencent (26), Xiaomi (12), Baidu (8) and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> (4).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five sectors dominate the roll-call - e-commerce, internet finance, health, cultural and entertainment and logistics - accounting for 92 of them, well over half, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is home to 70 unicorns, 43 per cent of the total, followed Shanghai (36), Alibaba's home patch Hangzhou (17), Shenzhen (13) and Hong Kong (4).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That latest list might not be a fully accurate picture that recognises all China's unicorns, as valuations do fluctuate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But what is at least clear, is that rapidly expanding tech start-ups do represent the nation's creme of the crop in terms of innovation, and that they will play a crucial part in fuelling high-growth within the economy, with the government remaining eager to have them listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To achieve that, the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">has set up a fast-track vetting process, and has urged the country's top bankers to submit initial public offerings (IPOs) proposals pronto.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A prime example is Foxconn Industrial Internet, the mainland unit of Taiwan's Foxconn, which had its planned Chinese IPO waved through after just 36 days, compared with the usual waiting time of one to two years, or longer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/31/183a25fe-33df-11e8-9019-a420e6317de0_image_hires_132521.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the country's leading domestic smartphone maker, is now considering offering part of its shares on the domestic market, after it was approached personally recently by CSRC chairman Liu Shiyu, sources close the regulator say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company had previously planned an IPO in Hong Kong in early January, which could have given it a thumping valuation of around US$100 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Beijing seriously stepped up its lobbying in the hope of holding up Xiaomi as its model tech flotation, putting other previous large-scale headline foreign listings - includingAlibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] andTencent[https://www.scmp.com/topics/tencent] - into the shade, sources close to the regulator say.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the other top targets, Chinese news aggregator Toutiao.com stands out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Translated into “Today's Headlines”, it has already attracted hefty investment from US dollar funds, and is reported to have been approached by China's regulators, too, dangling carrots to list at home, and is poising for a mainland IPO next year, banking sources add.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Toutiao raised more than US$2 billion in its latest funding round in August 2017, boosting its valuation to more than US$20 billion, according to Reuters. Ranked fifth overall in China by total time spent online by users, the app prides itself on its machine learning algorithms to create personalised news feeds, which pulled in US$869 million in advertising revenue in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's vast and still growing population of internet users has helped foster a unique environment whereby tech start-ups can enjoy huge success in an unusually short period of time, according to a joint report released by US-based </span><span class="s3">Boston Consulting Group</span><span class="s1">, Alibaba, Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> in September last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The term “unicorn” was first coined in 2013 by US-based seed investor Aileen Lee, who chose the mythical horse-like beast with a twisted single horn to highlight how billion-dollar technology start-up were once the stuff of myth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the irony is that Chinese unicorns are now being created at a much faster rate than their US counterparts, added the report, which examined the development cycles of 175 from both markets over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2010, almost every new-billion-dollar start-up that broke into the unicorn arena, called the US or Europe home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It now takes just four years on average in China, however, from gestation to unicorn status, compared with a seven year-maturity in the US, says Boston Consulting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's progress is even more impressive when you consider that 46 per cent of these Chinese firms - fed well by a bull market and a new generation of disruptive technology - broke through the all-important US$1 billion valuation in just two years from launch, against nine per cent of US unicorns achieving the goal within the same time frame.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As one technology news website put it recently, with the number of Chinese unicorns growing so fast, we might have to change the term into ‘dragons' in the very near future.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will need to step up development of a sustainable ecosystem for a growing hi-tech start-up community to help foster the city's next US$1 billion “unicorn”, according to industry experts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would mean plugging the city's big gaping hole in funding resources to support these entrepreneurs, said Gary Chan Shueng-han, director of the Entrepreneurship Centre at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The ecosystem in Hong Kong will remain incomplete without a large pool of funding being established and made widely available to the start-up community,” said Chan on the sidelines of a forum on innovation and entrepreneurship on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New ventures remain hard-pressed to raise cash, particularly for expansion and development after the initial start-up period, despite government incentives and early support from the city's small band of angel investors, according to participants in a panel discussion under the “One Step Ahead Series” organised by the Asia Society of Hong Kong and sponsored by J P Morgan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brandon Ng, co-founder and chief executive at local start-up Ampd Energy, said his company is an example of one that tapped investors from overseas to push forward its business, which aims to make diesel generators obsolete with its advanced battery-powered energy storage system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Ng and Chan said they are hopeful that Hong Kong logistics company GoGoVan's recent success in joining the ranks of unicorns - start-ups valued in excess of US$1 billion - would encourage the city's banking sector to increase its support of local technology entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We're not going to see the effects of that in the next few weeks, but we'll certainly start to see that over the next few months,” Ng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan last month agreed to a merger with 58 Suyun, the freight business of mainland Chinese online classifieds giant 58 Home, to create the city's first unicorn.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Ng and Chan said hardware-based start-ups, including those in the electronics sector, have the potential to follow the path of GoGoVan because these companies' business models would potentially cover a broader, global market than just Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nicolas Aguzin, the chairman and chief executive for the Asia-Pacific at J P Morgan, said Hong Kong start-ups should look at scaling up to create an international business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors are more interested in the business model and potential of a start-up than where it is based,” said Aguzin. “That means Hong Kong's start-ups compete with their peers from all over the world, particularly mainland China, to secure funding. To become a viable investment proposition ... Hong Kong start-ups need to look beyond domestic opportunities. Investors are attracted to start-ups that can grow and be scaled.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan pointed out that travel technology start-up Tink Labs has the potential to be the next Hong Kong unicorn based on its international business model.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong gears up for an IPO bonanza, including the offering from smartphone maker Xiaomi next month that could raise up to US$10 billion, which could temporarily freeze record amount of funds in the city, bankers and brokers believe the city's financial system will be tested if more than one company tries to raise funds at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, said one unicorn listing will not be a problem for the city, but two or more to coming together could.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is a free market so no regulator will restrict when the issuers want to list their companies, so it is possible two to three unicorns could launch their IPOs simultaneously,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The investment banks which act as sponsors will usually prevent two blockbuster IPOs from overlapping. But if they do choose to list at the same time, brokers and bankers may need to choose between them as they have a ceiling as to how much IPO financing they can offer,” he said, adding that they may only give margin loans to one IPO which they believe has the best potential to rise and not for the weaker ones.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More unicorns are expected to list here after </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> carried out the largest listing reform in more than two decades in April to accept giant tech firms with dual-class shareholding structure and biotech firms without revenue to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors generally borrow money from brokers and banks to subscribe to the new shares, causing huge sums of money to be locked up for a few days from the closure of the IPO until investors receive their refunds after the listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor's US$1.12b IPO set to reignite Hong Kong listings market[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142841/ping-good-doctors-us112b-ipo-set-reignite-hong-kong-listings]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HK$8.77 billion (US$1.2 billion) IPO of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, also known as Ping An Good Doctor, led to a 17 per cent year on year increase in Hong Kong's loans growth in April to HK$9.96 trillion, while money supply M2 was up 13.6 per cent annually to HK$14.34 trillion, according to data from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in terms of funds temporarily frozen by an IPO, Good Doctor ranked 11th as it locked up only HK$376.8 billion. The record is held by </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction</span><span class="s1">, which had frozen HK$540.9 billion during its IPO in March 2008.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Good Doctor was oversubscribed 653 times compared to </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction</span><span class="s1">'s 291 times, it raised only a quarter of the railway company's US$5.4 billion IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Xiaomi IPO is expected to break the record for the amount of money frozen in the city as its IPO may reach US$10 billion, which is double that of </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction</span><span class="s1">.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi and other upcoming unicorn IPOs are set to lock up much more money than in the past,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities. “We have never faced such challenges before as not many tech giants listed here in the past,” adding that </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> only became big much after its listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong also believed that Hong Kong could cope with multiple listings simultaneously because as a free market there is no limit to capital flowing into the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/18/d7bf9590-72bd-11e8-aa4d-d2a0e82fc143_image_hires_163646.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“International investors could freely bring in money to buy Xiaomi's or any other unicorn's IPO. Banks and brokers could also extend margin to customers, money supply could increase any time during the IPO period and banks have already started to prepare for that by increasing the deposit rates for large sums,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such signs are already visible. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> on Friday increased the six-month time deposit rates for amounts over HK$10,000 to 1.8 per cent from 1.6 per cent. Other banks are offering even more aggressive interest rates ranging from 2 to 2.3 per cent for one-year time deposits of more than HK$100,000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, local banks have started accumulating liquidity ahead of the Xiaomi's roadshow on June 23. The one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor) rose to 1.60 per cent last week, the highest in 10 years while three-month Hibor climbed to 2.01 per cent, which shows that banks are fighting for money in the interbank market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's more than a month now since logistics company GoGoVan became the first Hong Kong start-up to be valued at more than US$1 billion, and now rival Lalamove has staked its claim as the city's next "unicorn" after raising US$100 million from a new round of funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A unicorn is a start-up valued at over US$1 billion. Here are five things everyone should know about these two:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FOUNDERS:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Young entrepreneurs Steven Lam Hoi-yuen, Nick Tang Kuen-wai and Reeve Kwan Chun-man established GoGoVan in 2013, following their initial work on a small lunchbox delivery service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A graduate of </span><span class="s3">Stanford University</span><span class="s1">, Chow Shing-yuk founded Lalamove in 2013 after working in a management consulting job at </span><span class="s3">Bain &amp; Company</span><span class="s1"> and spending a stint as a professional poker player. Lalamove was previously known as EasyVan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">THE BUSINESSES:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both GoGoVan and Lalamove compete in the on-demand, small goods logistics market, creating separate ordering platforms to match delivery van drivers with millions of users in Hong Kong and other markets across Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PATHS TO "UNICORN" STATUS:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan merged with 58 Suyun, the freight business of mainland Chinese online classified giant 58 Home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lalamove raised US$100 million in a new funding round led by ShunWei Capital, a venture capital firm co-founded by Xiaomi chief executive Lei Jun, to lift its valuation at close to US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">STRATEGIES:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan and Lalamove are both moving aggressively to expand their operations into regional on-demand logistics powerhouses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lalamove currently operates in 100 cities on the mainland and claims to be the market leader in terms of transaction volumes. Its other markets include Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before its merger with 58 Suyun, GoGoVan already set up a sprawling online logistics and freight operation in 14 cities across Asia. The merger allows it to quickly establish operations in 300 mainland cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">EARLY INVESTORS:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan counted Centurion Private Equity, </span><span class="s3">Renren</span><span class="s1">, former 91 Wireless chief executive Hu Zemin, Singapore Press Holdings and the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lalamove had Crystal Stream Capital, Mindworks Ventures, AppWorks, Blackhole Capital and Xianghe Capital.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, operator of the world's largest online shopping platforms, wants to help foster more start-ups in Hong Kong with billion-dollar valuations, following the successful bet last year that put logistics start-up GoGoVan on the path to "unicorn" status.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six start-ups in the city have received a combined US$10 million from the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, the company's not-for-profit initiative. That has brought the total amount invested by the fund to around US$20 million since its November 2015 launch, financing a total of 12 start-ups out of 1,400 business proposals reviewed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our portfolio companies have also developed vast synergies with the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> ecosystem," said Cindy Chow Lok Mei-ki, the fund's executive director. "We select companies with business models that will be able to scale up and be successful."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said she was hopeful "that there will be more unicorns [to emerge] from our portfolio and serve as role models to the younger generation" after Hong Kong logistics company GoGoVan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan, one of the fund's first investees last year, agreed last month to a merger with 58 Suyun, the freight business of 58 Home, one of China's largest online classifieds company , that valued the combined company at more than US$1 billion, making it the city's first unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That merger also created Asia's largest online platform in the intra-city logistics and freight business, according to China Renaissance Group, the deal's financial adviser.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our goal at Qupital is also to become a unicorn," company founder and director Andy Chan said in an interview. "More unicorns means more people will have confidence in the Hong Kong market, and entrepreneurs can become angel investors afterwards."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qupital runs an online exchange that helps small businesses in Hong Kong raise cash against unpaid invoices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many businesses here that had cash locked up in unpaid invoices, while being underserved by traditional lenders with slow and cumbersome processes," said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He estimated that more than 25 per cent of Hong Kong's 300,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises have reported the lack of access to working capital served as a major barrier to their growth prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Alibaba fund's other new investees include Origami Labs, which uses so-called bone conduction technology to produce a voice-activated ring; local bike-sharing operator Gobee.bike; Prenetics, a genetic testing and digital health company; CompareAsiaGroup, operator of a personal finance management platform; and Aqumon, which runs a robo-advisory engine developed by Magnum Research, a company incubated by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the fund has cast a wider net to help more entrepreneurs in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April, the fund teamed up with Cyberport and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corp on a US$3 million start-up contest called "Jumpstarter".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital from Chinese technology firms is deciding the winners in India's tech start-up market, according to venture capitalists.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indian companies chosen by tech giants such as Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding have received vast amounts of capital, enabling them to put rivals out of business by building their own ecosystem and developing new products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investors have been using this “winner-takes-all” strategy in India for the past few years, having seen it pay off for late stage start-ups in China and the US, said Karthik Reddy, co-founder and managing director of Mumbai-based Blume Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example Ola, India's equivalent of Uber, with the backing by Tencent and SoftBank was able to shut down its rival TaxiForSure - part of Blume Ventures' portfolio - in 2016, a year after it bought the competitor for US$200 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Nobody can contend with that capital,” said Reddy, at the Asia Private Equity Forum on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the last 18 months, Chinese companies have poured around US$2.37 billion into Indian start-ups, according to data research firm Tracxn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">South Africa-based </span><span class="s3">Naspers</span><span class="s1">, an early-stage investor in Tencent, and Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1">, an early investor in Alibaba, have been actively ploughing money into India and are seen as close partners of the two Chinese companies in which they are still major shareholders. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1">, along with Alibaba, took a seat as a major shareholder on the board of Paytm, India's largest digital payments start-up, after the Japanese investor poured in US$1.4 billion - the largest single transaction for funding in the country's technology sector - last May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The money is set to help Paytm expand its user base and start to offer financial services products, mirroring the growth strategy of </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, Alibaba's payment affiliate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, </span><span class="s3">Naspers</span><span class="s1"> invested US$80 million in Indian food delivery platform Swiggy, and US$71 million in </span><span class="s3">Flipkart</span><span class="s1">, India's largest e-commerce start-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The winner-takes-all tactic will pay off in the long run, said Richard Ji, managing partner of All-Stars Investment, a major shareholder of Chinese phone maker Xiaomi, at Wednesday's forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund was the biggest investor in Xiaomi's latest round of fundraising, valuing the unicorn at US$45 billion in late 2014. Xiaomi was reportedly considering an initial public offering this year, with a valuation of US$100 billion, making it the most expensive unicorn in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Capital can make a significant difference in China's late stage [start-up] market,” Ji said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2014, there has been a lot of consolidation in the fiercely competitive sector. Examples include the mergers between taxi-hailing app Didi and Uber China, and online classifieds sites </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1"> and Ganji.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For late stage start-ups, how much capital they can get determines whether or not they will survive. Investors with deep pockets can also provide start-ups with strategic resources and help them grow, Ji said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smaller investors in India, such as Blume Ventures, tend to put money into early stage start-ups to avoid competition, according to Hu Jianlong, founder of a Beijing-based tech news outlet with a focus on China and India.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital from Chinese tech companies is good for Indian start-ups, Hu said, as it brings the resources needed to build a sustainable supply chain or find business partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eventually that decides who the winners are,” said Reddy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's sprawling network of start-ups worth at least US$1 billion expanded to 181 in the third quarter, overtaking the United States as home to greatest number of successful new ventures, according to Shanghai-based Hurun Report said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's second-largest economy has added 34 “unicorns”, or start-ups worth at least US$1 billion, in the third quarter, the publisher said in a release on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-ups are worth a combined 4.8 trillion yuan (US$696 billion), and the valuation of its biggest unicorn, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, has exceeded its counterparts in the US - Uber and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China has already surpassed the US to become the country with the most unicorns,” said chairman and chief researcher of the Hurun report, Rupert Hoogewer, in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These unicorns, mostly in the new economy, are the fastest-growing companies with the most potential to grow big against a slowing economy.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the report does not provide an up-to-date figure of the amount of US-based unicorns, August data by CB Insights and PitchBook shows the tally could be somewhere between 133 and 138.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's vast number of start-ups in industries spanning from e-commerce to fintech and artificial intelligence has transformed the way Chinese people eat, shop and entertain over the past decade, riding on a flood of enthusiastic early investment capital from within China and abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A total of 20 Chinese unicorns went public during the first three quarters of this year, while another three merged with other companies, according to the report. Once listed, companies can no longer be considered a unicorn.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, the fintech firm operating China's largest online payment platform, topped the start-up ranking with a 1 trillion yuan valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In comparison, Uber's latest valuation stood at US$76 billion in August, while </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> closed the latest round of funding last year valued at US$31 billion.</span></p>

The youngest among them is Luckin Coffee, a Beijing-based coffee chain founded just last year to take on </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1">. It has since expanded to over 1,000 stores across 13 Chinese cities, boosting it valuation to 7 billion yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is approaching lunchtime on a crisp and clear Thursday in December and the first of the start-up founders have arrived at the glass-roofed teahouse in Beijing's Rock Sparrow hutong. Inside the toasty members-only club, a long narrow table has been set up, blinds are drawn and about seven or eight small-business owners will try to interest investors looking for the Next Big Thing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Welcome to start-up pitching, China-style.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Things, however, are noticeably slower this afternoon, according to Zheng Linghui, owner of the teahouse and organiser of the weekly meetings by Jianyihui, a community for private equity and angel investors. It is two weeks to the year-end and many investors have closed their books and in holiday mode.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the seven companies that took part in the meeting, one pitched a high-quality tampon with a “silky feel”, another presented its roller-skating lessons, and yet another was engaged in wilderness survival training for companies looking to build team camaraderie among their employees. This session's theme was consumption. Other weeks, it could be technology or some other sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Questions from the investors, mainly from smaller venture capital firms, centred on operating numbers and how the start-ups differentiate themselves from what is in the market. Each session takes around 30 minutes and the event ended at about 5pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weekly session is one of hundreds of similar meetings that take place each day in China as start-ups seek funding and investors try to predict the next unicorn, or privately held company with a valuation north of US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More start-ups in China succeed in getting funding, but investors are becoming choosy[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2112026/more-start-ups-china-succeed-getting-funding-investors-are]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting one's own business - and investing in them - has reached fever pitch in China in recent years as the tech boom mints a new generation of billionaires who are involved in online shopping, mobile gaming or artificial intelligence rather than real-estate development or financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has encouraged the entrepreneurial vein as it seeks to ensure enough jobs for the world's most populous nation, while steering the economy away from the old, foreign investment-led manufacturing model to one that is grounded in internet-related technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dubbed by some as the fourth industrial revolution, this trend supports advanced automation through hi-tech developments such as the internet of things, big data analytics, cloud computing and machine learning. Artificial intelligence, for example, was given prominent attention at the latest Communist Party leadership congress[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2115935/chinas-xi-jinping-highlights-ai-big-data-and-shared-economy].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors have responded by pouring billions into ideas from ride-hailing to bicycle-sharing to self-driving cars. Some start-ups, such as ride-hailing company </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, bike-sharing service operator Mobike and internet media firm ByteDance, carry valuations exceeding that of bricks-and-mortar companies, while internet giant Tencent Holdings[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=700&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] recently grabbed headlines when it crossed US$500 billion in market value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December alone, bike-sharing start-up Hellobike raised a combined 3.3 billion yuan (US$504 million) from investors including Fosun Capital, GGV Capital and Ant Financial Services Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gold rush, however, is tapering, according to Zheng. It is getting tougher for start-ups to raise money as the era of silly money pouring into half-baked ideas comes to an end, he said. A former private equity investor, Zheng founded Jianyihui, a community for private equity firms and angel investors, in 2011 to help match start-ups with financiers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China takes gold in race to develop billion dollar start-up ‘unicorns'[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111049/china-takes-gold-race-develop-billion-dollar-start-unicorns]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Previously, making a profit could wait. But start-up founders are getting more realistic as it's harder to locate new capital,” said Zheng. “Investors are now asking for sound figures, and a clear and healthy business model.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Wang Cen, a partner at </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> China, the keen interest in starting up companies is giving him of lots of prospects - both good and bad - to sieve through.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Founding a business is a marathon and it's important to invest in those fit for running 42km,” Wang said before attending a separate event for start-ups in Beijing. “But the truth is that in China, start-up founders change track too easily. The majority can only do 3km.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It takes an average of four years for a start-up to achieve unicorn status in China, compared with seven years in the US, according to a report by </span><span class="s3">Boston Consulting Group</span><span class="s1"> in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China had more than 64,600 private equity funds as of the end of November, managing a combined 10.09 trillion yuan, compared to 1.49 trillion yuan just three years ago, according to statistics from the Asset Management Association of China, an organisation that represents the country's mutual fund industry.The truth is that in China, start-up founders change track too easily.Wang Cen, a partner at </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The road is also littered with casualties. At its peak, China had almost 5,000 group-buying companies, 3,500 peer-to-peer lenders and over 300 live-streaming platforms, according to the BCG report. At present, there are a few dozen at most with enough scale to survive the competition in each of those sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the Beijing teahouse that December afternoon, Liu Ying, the investment director of tampon start-up Alffany, was encouraged by the response from several investors, who asked for the company's business proposal after her presentation. One, in particular, asked for more statistics and the company's market assessment. Alffany introduced its first product, a high-end sanitary towel made from silk, a month earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I will likely visit Beijing again and follow up with the investor,” said Liu, who is based in Shanghai. “In the meantime, we'll gather our three-month financial figures and pitch for an angel round of financing.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's favourite temple for seeking the granting of wishes - Wong Tai Sin - is one of four items of the city's intangible cultural heritage to be added to the latest national list, the government announced yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The others are the Hang Hau Hakka unicorn dance, Quanzhen temples' Taoist ritual music and the arts of the guqin, a traditional stringed instrument.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beliefs and customs surrounding Wong Tai Sin date back to 1915, although the folk religion originated in Jinhua , Zhejiang province centuries ago and was introduced into the Lingnan region at the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 1921, the Sik Sik Yuen group assumed management of the Wong Tai Sin Temple, and today the folk religion plays an important charitable role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sik Sik Yuen has established various social services for the local community, in keeping with Wong Tai Sin's spirit of granting every wish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Hau Hakka unicorn dance has been practised for more than 200 years. The Hakka people believe the Chinese unicorn, the qilin, is an auspicious animal that can ward off evil.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Quanzhen, meaning "complete perfection", forms one of two schools of ritual music for Taoism. It has been developed in Hong Kong for years. The Taoist music inherited by Fung Ying Seen Koon is considered one of the most typical representatives of the Quanzhen temples tradition in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The arts of the guqin include the techniques for making and playing the seven-stringed plucked instrument.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A huge number of Chinese technology unicorns are likely to launch initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the next 12 to 24 months, which could significantly boost liquidity in its capital market, according to Nicolas Aguzin, chairman and chief executive for Asia-Pacific at JPMorgan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“2018 will be a blockbuster year for Chinese unicorns to come to the capital market,” Aguzin said in an interview with the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. “Investors here [in Hong Kong] have strong appetite for these high-growth, new economy companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Hall, co-head of the company's investment banking unit in Asia-Pacific and global head of technology services, said a wave of Chinese technology IPOs in the next 12 to 24 months is likely to set a record for Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmond Hui, chief executive at Bright Smart Securities, said the listings of Good Doctor and Xiaomi might be the catalyst for a potential wave of new economy IPOs, such as that of Ping An unit Lufax, an online wealth management platform, and Inke, a video streaming mobile app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These companies are representative of China's new economy and their flotations could ignite Hong Kong's IPO market in the second quarter, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, Alibaba went public in a record-setting US$25 billion IPO, which valued it at US$168 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four years on, a lot of Chinese technology companies have matured and scaled up, and are now reaching a point where their shareholders want to monetise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi applies to raise funds in Hong Kong, giving city the pole position in 2018 global IPO race[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144422/xiaomi-applies-raise-funds-hong-kong-giving-city-pole-position]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think this [the number and scale of unicorns seeking to tap the IPO market] is an unprecedented phenomenon in global capital markets. It is a historical event,” said Hall. These IPOs will bring “fundamental changes” to Hong Kong's capital market, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has the world's most dynamic technology start-up scene, thanks to the rapid rise of an internet economy supported by a high mobile penetration rate and mobile-first consumer habits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hurun Research Institute recently released a list of start-ups in China, with 151 companies reaching unicorn status by the end of the first quarter. Their combined valuations exceeded 4 trillion yuan (US$630 billion). Half of these unicorns were incubated or backed by industry titans such as Alibaba and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings.2018</span><span class="s1"> will be a blockbuster year for Chinese unicorns to come to the capital marketNicolas Aguzin, chairman and chief executive for Asia-Pacific, JPMorgan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think China is leading the global unicorn race ahead of the US,” said Aguzin. Some big Chinese companies have created an ecosystem for innovation, and are incubating some of the best technologies in the e-commerce, financial, health care, mobility and entertainment sectors, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are in a world where the winner takes most. Being early is important, and being sizeable is critical.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For companies in the technology and innovative sectors, if they can build a critical mass or user base fast enough, they will be able to generate a “network effect”, which is hard for others to replicate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, the chief executive at Partners Capital, said as a group of Chinese internet and technology companies have expanded and are now near the stage of going public, the competition to win over big Chinese “unicorn IPOs” has also intensified among global markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is probably why stock exchanges in Hong Kong, China, the United States and Singapore have made or considered rule changes to entice such companies, whose debuts are expected to bring significant changes to their capital markets, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How to manage a conglomerate with business across the globe that's scattered across different industry sectors? The answer from </span><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> is to implement a global programme to fill its partner ranks and find more senior managers from local markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Liang Xinjun said that to optimise the age structure of Fosun's management team, integrate overseas teams, and enhance localisation, the company had increased the number of partners to 21 from the original four.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It had also flattened its organisational structure by creating bigger teams and simplifying reporting procedures, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fosun started from scratch in the early 1990s in the pharmaceutical market and later developed into a conglomerate. It has been one of China's most aggressive outbound dealmakers in recent years and has snapped up everything from insurance companies to circus performers.We have made communication much more efficient and accurateLiang Xinjun, Fosun</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> now oversees six insurance companies based in Europe, the United States, Hong Kong and mainland China. It also controls global resort operator </span><span class="s3">Club Mediterranee</span><span class="s1">, from France, and Canada's </span><span class="s3">Cirque du Soleil</span><span class="s1"> circus troupe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company also owns major stakes in many other foreign companies including US media company Studio 8, and British travel agency </span><span class="s3">Thomas Cook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liang said Fosun now had 196 managing directors. Amost half - 89 - were based offshore, with 80 recruited as local talent. All the managing directors report directly to the board and chief executive, with endorsement from the partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's reporting procedures previously involved more layers and took longer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In this way we have made communication much more efficient and accurate," Liang said. "The expanded partner team shares the responsibilities and risks."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fosun ‘back to normal' after company chairman Guo's brief disappearance last year, says chief executive[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1933484/fosun-back-normal-after-company-chairman-guos-brief-disappearance]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By shifting more responsibilities to senior overseas managers, Fosun's management had become more project-oriented, and quicker in responding to market changes. Also, the intermediate and backstage teams had been merged into business operations to provide strong, systemic support, Liang added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a letter to staff in January, Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang said the global partner scheme had been introduced because Fosun had gradually evolved into a multinational enterprise, rooted in China but with global competencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fosun withdraws plan to acquire Israeli insurer Phoenix Holdings[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1913613/fosun-withdraws-plan-acquire-israeli-insurer-phoenix-holdings]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The founding partners of Fosun made it clear from the beginning of our entrepreneurial journey that our shareholding ratio would be more dynamic than static," he wrote. "We have always been expecting more enthusiastic people to join, making Fosun continuously bigger and stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Fosun's partners do not have lifetime tenures and are not arranged according to years of service. We hope to attract younger, stronger people who meet our standards to join this organisation, and decommission those who cannot meet these standards."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seeking to emulate legendary US investor Warren Buffett in using insurance capital for value investing, Fosun has been sticking to an "Insurance + Investment" twin-driver business model. However, some investors have raised questions about Fosun's long-term profitability, fearing it has fingers in too many widely dispersed pies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1">'s revenue rose 27.6 per cent to 78.80 billion yuan (HK$94.28 billion) last year, generating a net profit of 8.04 billion yuan, up 17.3 per cent year on year. In 2014 its profit had grown by 24.2 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the spate of investments pushed the company's outstanding debt from 54 billion yuan in 2011 to 115 billion yuan last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liang said in addition to introducing the global partner scheme, Fosun had a new "unicorn" strategy for future development, and planed to focus in future on discovering and investing in profitable unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said a unicorn was a project that could generate a US$1 billion profit for Fosun in two years, or one where the valuation of its investment could increase by US$1 billion in two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Typically, a unicorn is created by utilising idle and cheap resources through mature products and business models, or promoting traditional industries with mobile internet and artificial intelligence," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Fosun had already invested in a few unicorns in the health, wealth and happiness sectors, three core themes of the company's business.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New energy vehicle and automotive ancillary service projects have attracted heavy venture capital (VC) investment into China over the past six months, bolstering valuations of some automotive start-ups into unicorn status, or a private company valued at over US$1 billion, according to a new </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> report.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Autotech continues to attract venture capital interest in China,” Philip Ng, head of technology of </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China wrote in the report, adding investors were also interested in battery power and charging infrastructure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China was also a key driver of VC investments into the region, with the stand-out deal worth US$1 billion by cryptocurrency mining gear maker Bitmain, although its business is unrelated with electric vehicle technology, a sector which received strong support from central government.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese co-working space unicorn URWork, backed by Alibaba-affiliate Ant Financial and Sequoia Capital, said it has closed a 1.2 billion yuan (US$179 million) pre-C fundraising from a group of Chinese investors, to push forward its global expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based shared-workspace startup, a rival of WeWork, announced it received the pre-C round financing from state-owned property developer </span><span class="s3">Beijing Capital Land</span><span class="s1">, conglomerate Beijing Xingpai Group and Beijing Love &amp; Health Group (also known as Beijing Aikang), as well as investment firm Jingrong Holdings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company declined to disclose its valuation after the new funding deal, but said in June this year that it was worth US$1.3 billion when it landed its first shared workspace deal outside of China, in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">URWork's latest announcement comes as China has seen increasingly fierce competition between large domestic operators of co-working centres, which offer similar chic working environments, open spaces and the free use of smart services.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adding to its planned first facility in the US in New York, URWork will soon open its second US facility in Los Angeles and expand into Hong Kong and Taiwan within the year, URWork founder and chief executive Mao Daqing told Chinese newspaper 21st Century Business Herald in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is also looking at launches in San Francisco, London, Paris and Berlin, as well as Southeast Asian countries a bid to challenge WeWork.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our overseas footprint will partly overlap with WeWork, but our vision is more on helping small Chinese companies go global,” Mao said at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overall, the start-up is targeting 100,000 seats at 160 facilities in 32 cities worldwide over the next three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, on July 19 Shanghai-based rival Naked Hub agreed to merge with Singapore-based peer JustCo with the goal of creating the largest premium co-working space operator in Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its statement on Monday, URWork said the introduction of Jingrong Holdings in the latest round would facilitate the start-up's expansion in the US and other overseas markets through its overseas capital markets experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In January this year URWork became the first company in China's co-working space to achieve unicorn status - reaching a valuation of more than a US$1 billion. Of about 60 sites it has opened since then, more than half are in Beijing and Shanghai.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wuxi AppTec, China's biggest contract medical researcher that floated in May, has made the unusual move of issuing a statement warning its share price is rising too fast and its valuation is excessive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company closed at 107.36 yuan on Friday in Shanghai, rising by the allowed daily maximum of 10 per cent for the 13th straight session. Its share price has now surged almost five-fold from its initial public offering price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The company's price-to-earnings ratio is relatively high compared with comparable companies in the industry,” said Wuxi AppTec in the statement filed to the stock exchange. “We particularly remind investors of investment risks, rational decision making and prudential investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But shareholders seemed to be ignoring the warning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The buying binge had made Wuxi AppTec almost a third more expensive than the industry average valuation, the company said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Wuxi frenzy is now seen by some brokers as highlighting a growing challenge facing China's regulators, who have been gearing up to lure larger overseas-listed Chinese companies and unicorns in the technology industry to list domestically.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market has pretty high expectations for the performance of the stock as it's actually the first unicorn company to hit the domestic market,” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock may rise by the 10 per cent daily cap for another two or three days. It's a bit speculative.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While individual investors almost dominate 80 per cent of the nation's stock trading, it is now feared their participation in trading in these companies may well lead to runaway movements in other share prices.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scorching hot IPO of Ping An Good Doctor, the first unicorn to hit Hong Kong in 2018, has sparked such massive retail fervour that brokers have so far extended more than HK$160 billion (US$20.3 billion) in margin loans to retail clients keen on getting their hands on the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The margin loans extended to retail investors has far surpassed the HK$12.5 billion extended to investors for China Literature's IPO last November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor's US$1.12b IPO set to reignite Hong Kong listings market[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142841/ping-good-doctors-us112b-ipo-set-reignite-hong-kong-listings]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor, formally known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, aims to raise as much as HK$8.77 billion (US$1.12 billion) from the sale of just over 160 million shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO, Hong Kong's most valuable so far this year, is set to become the biggest flotation by an internet-based business since </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s HK$11.9 billion last September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By Thursday morning, 17 brokerage firms had extended about HK$168 billion to their margin clients, more than 290 times the value of shares offered to the public, reflecting the huge gap between investor demand and supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/26/d01b4818-491c-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_145230.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokerages and banks in the city make margin loans to retail investors for selected IPOs, which can be up to 90 per cent of the value of shares subscribed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Literature was the most chased IPO in Hong Kong in a decade, attracting total retail investor capital of more than HK$520 billion, only second to </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction</span><span class="s1">'s HK$535 billion in 2008. Retail investors had submitted bids to buy 625 times more than what China Literature had on offer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Literature raised HK$8.3 billion from its IPO in November.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's possible Good Doctor can attract more investor capital [than China Literature], as there were several hot IPOs at the end of last year which had diluted retail interest,” said Edmond Hui, chief executive at Hong Kong-based Bright Smart Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities, said the timing had worked in Good Doctor's favour drawing interest from investors. “It has a new economy concept and comes just as Hong Kong launches its listing rule reform making it easier for new economy companies to list here,” said Yip.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Alvin Cheung, associate director for Prudential Brokerage, was more cautious on whether Good Doctor could surpass China Literature to become the hottest IPO in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Hong Kong stock market is faced with more uncertainties this year, including how the trade dispute between the US and China could evolve and risk of rising interest rates in Hong Kong as the Fed appears to have turned more hawkish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Tao, the medical service app's chairman and chief executive, said during the company's IPO launch on Sunday in Hong Kong that the IPO proceeds would be used to expand “our business, and fund future domestic and overseas acquisitions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the prospectus, around 40 per cent of the net proceeds will be used for business expansion, such as its e-commerce business, hiring sales and medical professionals, acquiring new users and funding marketing activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spin-off of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, Good Doctor is currently China's largest online health care and medical platform in terms of users, with some 193 million registered users at the end of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company posted a 2017 loss of 1 billion yuan (US$158.86 million), its third annual loss, but Lee Yuansiong, deputy chief executive at </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, said that it was normal for a tech unicorn in its early phase.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies says Hong Kong should not allow companies with a "center of gravity" in Greater China to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong as it would send a wrong message that the SAR is willing to settle for being a secondary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chairman Francis Leung Pak-to said mainland technology companies should not be allowed to have a secondary listing, or the Hong Kong market will become second-tier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies should have a market capitalization of at least HK$8 billion for an initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This benchmarks against the unicorn enterprises which are early stage companies that enjoy a valuation of US$1 billion or higher,'' the chamber added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> said "dual share class" is against the interests of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The principle of "one-share-one- vote'' accords equal treatment to all shareholders by ensuring that the control of a company is in direct proportion to the economic interest, it added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After smartphone giant Xiaomi (1810) got listed on the stock exchange of Hong Kong with a weighted voting structure, </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">, another unicorn, has caught the public's eye.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The food delivery giant just passed its listing hearing yesterday, and if all goes to plan, a road show will follow shortly with the company expected to get listed on September 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has never had any food delivery platform listed before so investors should find this stock a very "fresh" option. However, more research is needed to see if it is truly "delicious" bet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> shares the on-demand food delivery market with Alibaba's Ele.me in the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its growth has been rapid in the past few years, with revenues surging seven-fold from 4 billion yuan (HK$4.57 billion) in 2015 to 33.9 billion yuan in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, like other new-economy companies, </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> has recorded significant losses as well and in 2017, it posted a loss of 19 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has also undertaken six rounds of fundraising. In the latest round, it raised US$4 billion (HK$31.2 billion), which gave it a valuation of US$30 billion at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of now, we don't have an accurate valuation for </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">, though market sources put it at between US$35 billion and US$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If that's the case, US$35 billion should be the bottom end of the valuation, as investors can only make a profit if the valuation shows a premium.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also reported that </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> is looking to raise at least US$4 billion in the IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a worry however that the company could meet same fate as Xiaomi, whose valuation kept declining during its roadshow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On-demand food delivery has taken off like wildfire among mainlanders who regularly use these services, and this has led to fierce competition among rival online platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, a lunch set, which includes a delivery fee may initially cost around 20 yuan but after various discounts and coupons offered it could be bought for just a few yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There have also been some unbelievable promotions in which Hainanese chicken rice or a bottle of bubble tea has been offered for just 1 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the battle between </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> and Ele.me, is also a contest between China's two tech giants - Tencent (0700) and Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent became a significant investor in the company after Meituan and Dianping merged in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I have read an interesting report that says instant noodle manufacturers in the mainland have become the biggest losers amid the booming food delivery market as consumers are turning their backs on this ubiquitous pre-cooked fast food fix in preference of fresh food delivered right to their doorstep, which is cheap and of reasonable quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Little wonder then, that share prices of these manufacturers have not stopped falling lately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the first food delivery platform to get listed in Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> will definitely put a lot of effort into promoting its new retail, artificial intelligence and big data prowess.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With lessons having been learned from Xiaomi's listing, I believe the public relations team of Meituan will do a better job this time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland has described high-speed rail, Alipay, dockless shared bicycles and online shopping as "four great new inventions" which have made life easier for the common man. Among these, the high-speed rail is the only state-owned business, while the bike-sharing market seems to be going downhill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will be interesting to see if Alipay and online shopping enterprises including </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> can keep the flame alive.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, an online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform, is bringing its sizable initial public offering to Hong Kong, where it aims to raise over US$4 billion (HK$31.2 billion), people with knowledge of the deal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm filed plans late on Friday for the city's second multi-billion-dollar tech float this year after smartphone maker </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">'s blockbuster IPO of up to US$6.1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping is, after Xiaomi, the latest company with a dual-class share structure to file for a Hong Kong listing, under the city's new rules designed to attract new economy and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based firm, backed by gaming and social media company </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700), was valued at around US$30 billion in a fundraising round last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is aiming for a US$60-billion valuation with the IPO, though industry insiders said it may have difficulty reaching that target as it is still money-losing and relies on a cash-burning business model to boost growth. The firm is likely to list in October, said the people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping's other backers include venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and DST Global, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and state-owned investment company </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1">, as well as the </span><span class="s3">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, chief executive Wang Xing owns 11.4 percent of the company, while Tencent owns 20.1 percent and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> 11.4 percent. Wang will remain controlling shareholder after the listing, the prospectus showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its draft prospectus, which gave investors the first detailed look at its financial health ahead of the IPO, the company disclosed a 19 billion yuan (HK$22.79 billion) loss for 2017, steeper than in the previous two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its adjusted net loss - which excludes the impact of fair value changes of convertible redeemable preferred shares and other items - was 2.85 billion yuan, smaller than losses of 5.35 billion yuan in 2016 and 5.91 billion yuan in 2015, the prospectus showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Bank of Jiujiang starts its book building today, issuing 360 million H shares. Entry fee is HK$2,214 one broad lot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The management expects the IPO to support the bank's capital adequacy by pushing it up several percentage points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There will be 98 new companies listed in Hong Kong's stock exchange in the first half this year, up 44 percent year on year, according to an estimate by </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">. For the second half of 2018, E&amp;Y believed that IPOs in the city will be dominated by retail, technology and financial sectors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Yip did not reveal his target price for HKEx, the local exchange operator is facing special concern this year as markets expect a new listing rule as well as H-share convertibility will drive share prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Yip expected the Hong Kong stock market to perform better in the first half than the second and added that the Hang Seng Index will fluctuate between 28,000 and 33,000 points during the first six months this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yip said the initial public offering market in the SAR this year will benefit from the launch of the new listing rule that allows dual-class-share companies to debut in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new measure will attract more unicorn startup companies to go public. In the second half of this year, the US dollar will withdraw from Asian and European countries due to </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> interest rate increases and tax reform in the United States, said Yip.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though we eventually realized that such weird animals do not exist, it did nothing to stop our imagination from running wild, especially at night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From the dawn of civilization and throughout the world, people rightly or wrongly have had their own pantheon of phantoms and other beastly creatures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some of these have religious significance, others form the basis of myths and legends, which strangely still find currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some creatures are considered to have positive traits and to be benevolent to humans, while others are regarded as downright dangerous, even evil.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Museum of Art in Tsim Sha Tsui is exhibiting Fantastic Creatures from the British Museum _ an amazing collection of such bizarre life forms under one roof from now until April 11.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exhibition comprises 170 items from the Stone Age up to modern times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statues, carvings, pictures and other exhibits include the ancient Greek Gorgon, a two-headed dog from Africa, an ancient bird-woman, mermaids and, of course, the unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Needless to say, among the artifacts on display is the Chinese dragon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Inc</span><span class="s1"> has filed an application to list on the local bourse and will become the first new-economy firm that will go public in Hong Kong under the city's new listing rules for a dual share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700) is the only truly mega new-economy company listed in the SAR today after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> halted its listing plan in 2014. Because of this, local investors are expected to show keen interest in Xiaomi, tipped to launch its IPO as early as June of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even before Xiaomi submitted its application, its planned IPO was already a major market focus. Some investors, though, are wondering if its potential market valuation of US$100 billion (HK$780 billion) is justified.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's planned IPO is expected to be the biggest in the SAR since 2010 and may be the fourth largest in terms of funds raised. With the scale of its listing, it is the type of new-economy firms that the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) strives to attract. HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said approval of Xiaomi's listing application will not be fast-tracked and it is up to the company to decide on the date of its IPO launch. After its listing, Xiaomi is tipped to be in the top five of the 50 blue-chip companies in the benchmark Hang Seng index in terms of market valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's revenue surged from 66.8 billion yuan (HK$82.44 billion) in 2015 to 114.6 billion yuan last year. It lost 7.63 billion yuan in 2015, but made a net profit of 492 million yuan in 2016. It lost 43.9 billion yuan in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A key Xiaomi issue is whether it is to be deemed more as a smartphone maker or an internet services provider. If it is the former, it should have a relatively lower valuation, just like other smartphone makers. But its valuation can be much higher if it is regarded more as an ISP. Founder Lei Jun said Xiaomi is more than a smartphone maker, although hardware accounts for about 70 percent of total revenue, while internet services only contribute about 8.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Xiaomi has yet to fix a date for its debut, the short-term prospects are challenging. Several new-economy firms which listed previously, such as </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (6060), China Literature (0772), </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (2858) and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co</span><span class="s1"> (1833), have seen pressures in their share prices. Investors need to wait and see if Xiaomi will start an IPO craze.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is lagging behind foreign countries in the "cage-free eggs" movement as at least 70 percent of eggs sold in local supermarkets come from caged hens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Katherine Ma Tsz-kei, program manager of the Lever Foundation, an animal welfare group focused on farm animals, said there is little discussion on promoting cage-free or free ranch eggs in the SAR, unlike Europe, the United States, or South America, where companies are committed to ending the use of eggs from caged hens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To better understand the types of eggs Hongkongers eat, Lever examined the brands of eggs sold in 21 stores under eight supermarket chains - AEON, Unicorn Stores, U Select, Sogo, Wellcome, </span><span class="s3">China Resources Vanguard</span><span class="s1">, Yata and ParknShop - between September and November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It found out of 128 varieties of eggs being sold, only 10 percent of the fresh eggs were stated as cage-free. After checking with egg suppliers, 70 percent were found to be from caged hens, while the production method of 20 percent was unknown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"On battery cage egg farms, mother hens are crammed into cages so small each hen has less space than the size of a single sheet of A4 paper to live her entire life in," Ma said. "Battery cages represent one of the cruelest factory farming practices. They are so cruel they have been banned throughout the entire </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">, and in numerous parts of the United States."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pastime of running is growing rapidly in China as a burgeoning middle class with higher disposable incomes takes up exercise as part of a healthier lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Athletics Association</span><span class="s1"> (CAA), about five million runners took part in more than 1,000 competitive events in the mainland last year, roughly double the number in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the numbers are still small when compared to many western countries, leaving plenty of room for growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That creates a golden opportunity for the makers and vendors of running gear, according to Zhang Zhiyong, CEO of China Dongxiang, which owns the Italian sportswear brand Kappa in mainland China. He said a domestic unicorn - a company valued at more than US$1 billion - is likely to emerge in the sector before too long.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Running as a segment in the whole sportswear industry is far from being fully developed in China,” said Zhang, an industry veteran of more than 20 years who has previously served as CEO of Lining, China's best known domestic sports brand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China now has hundreds of marathons being held every year, so the base of customers is enormous. If someone could dig deeply into the running category and do things properly, it's very likely we will see the emergence of a domestic firm with a scale of more than US$1 billion in this segment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China only hosted 22 road running races nationwide seven years ago, a mere fraction of the 1,102 events recorded by the CAA in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The five million participants compares to an estimated 64 million people in the US who went jogging or running in 2016, suggesting the boom has a long way to go.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sport's increasing popularity is down to rising disposable incomes, better road conditions and the influence of a more health-conscious “western lifestyle” which advocates a greater work-life balance and taking better care of oneself, say analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Each Chinese runner spends at least 3,000 yuan a year on running gear, according to estimates by Alisports, the sports arm of e-commerce giant Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International brands still dominate the running sector. </span><span class="s3">Nike</span><span class="s1">, for example, tends to attract a lot of new runners or those who are slightly more advanced, while Japan's Asics generally appeals to more affluent veteran runners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said Kappa, which peaked in 2010 when it reported 4.26 billion yuan (US$670.9 million) in sales and 1.46 billion yuan in net profit but has since seen sales declines, would focus on niche sports areas including running and yoga. it will seek out better locations for new and existing shops and make the label more “distinctive” by going back to its roots.。</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to tell the old stories of Kappa, reviving the brand's legacy and we hope to reap double-digit growth in revenue this year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company plans to open 150 new shops this year, 100 of them under the Kappa Kids banner. Childrenswear has been one of the company's fastest growing segments this year, according to Zhang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the competitive edges Kappa has is its trendiness. However, that could in turn become a weak point for the label as the fashion tastes of customers change so fast these days,” said Hong Xueyu, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The brand's positioning in the China market should still be sports fashion as this is where its strength lies, but also to focus more on enhancing the functionality of its product offerings.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong-listed company reported net profit of 805 million yuan in 2017, down from 870 million a year earlier. Sales fell to 1.35 billion yuan from 1.5 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gamily Cheung, 15, was among dozens of fans who braved the rain yesterday to wait outside the </span><span class="s3">Ritz-Carlton</span><span class="s1"> hotel in Kowloon in the hope of getting a glimpse of Lady Gaga.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gamily - whose English name stands for "Gaga and monster I love you" - was waiting outside the hotel from 7am. She dressed up as a unicorn with a pointed pink horn to impress the US singer, saying the unicorn is her idol's favourite animal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I want to thank her for changing my life. I'm impressed by her perseverance in making her dream come true and how much she treasures freedom," Gamily said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before knowing her, I sometimes didn't like my own character. But she tells us to be ourselves, as we are all born this way and there is nothing wrong about being unique or different from others. She's made me become a more confident person and want to strive for my personal goal - which is to become a teacher and inspire others."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday night for her sell-out Born This Way Ball concerts. She signed autographs and posed for photos with her "little monsters", as she calls her fans, outside her hotel that night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the pop diva did not show up to meet the 40 or so fans who waited at the hotel yesterday. Instead she left a message on Twitter, saying: "I'm so happy to be in Hong Kong! We have four shows here! Thanks for buying tickets my amazing little monsters. I can't wait to rock this city."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kyle Cheung Long-him, 16, who waited outside the hotel yesterday, said he wanted to hug the superstar and get her autograph. "If I will meet her, I will cry and tell her I love her," Kyle said. "She's very nice to fans. She even asked the hotel staff to give us bottles of water. I will never open that bottle but keep it forever."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the crowd was Chloe Chan Tse-yau, 12, who had planned to go to Seoul with her mother last Friday to watch Lady Gaga's kick-off concert, before the local government labelled the show for adults only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chloe will have to settle for seeing the singer's concert in Hong Kong, the second stop of her 33-city world tour, this week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Lazada Group</span><span class="s1">, the Southeast Asian e-commerce titan, is extending its campaign to introduce a select range of Taobao merchandise in the region to Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, months after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> increased its stake in the “unicorn” start-up with another US$1 billion investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expansion intensifies Alibaba's bid to engage the fast-growing retail markets across Southeast Asia, which would accelerate its push towards achieving two billion global consumers by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is a true testament to the way the Lazada and Alibaba teams have come together to build the business in a fast and efficient way, combining consumer insights, technology know-how and local expertise,” said Lazada chief marketplace officer Aimone Ripa di Meana in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2012, Lazada forms part of Alibaba's international e-commerce business along with China outbound platform AliExpress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York-listed Alibaba, the world's largest e-commerce services provider, last month reported revenue from its international e-commerce business grew 136 per cent year on year to 2.6 billion yuan (US$394 million) in the quarter ended June 30.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Taobao Collection campaign, which covers a curated range of goods sourced from main Alibaba retail platforms Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com, was first launched by Lazada in its home market of Singapore six months ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The campaign was rolled out in Indonesia on Monday, which will be followed by launches in the Philippines on October 11 and Thailand on November 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lazada said it currently offers around 175 million products from international and local market brands and merchants across Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company estimates the Taobao Collection will contribute an average of about eight million new goods on offer for each of its five markets in the region, which includes Malaysia and Vietnam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said the most-popular product categories in the Taobao Collection included home decoration, kitchenware and furnishings, and an assortment of ladies, men's and kids' apparel and accessories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taobao Collection is expected to “take off in the region as it becomes available in more countries”, Lazada's Ripa di Meana said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia's total e-commerce revenue is forecast to exceed US$25 billion by 2020, according to business consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan. It said the region's largest online retail markets are currently Malaysia and Thailand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect more than 50 per cent of annual average revenue growth from Alibaba's international retail commerce efforts over the next five years,” said RJ Hottovy, a consumer strategist at </span><span class="s3">Morningstar</span><span class="s1">, in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post, announced in June a further US$1 billion investment in Lazada, which increased its stake to 83 per cent from the previous 51 per cent and raised the valuation of Southeast Asia's biggest e-commerce company to US$3.1 billion, according to venture capital database service CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hangzhou-based conglomerate made its initial US$1 billion investment in Lazada on April 2016, turning the company into a unicorn - a start-up valued at more than US$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Momentum appears to be gathering for Hong Kong entrepreneurs and start-ups, as the city's technology incubators are begging to make their impact felt, while three early-stage companies raised enough money to increase their valuations to US$1 billion, to reach the so-called unicorn status.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before the successful fundraising by SenseTime, GoGoVan or Lalamove vaulted into, or close to, the unicorn club, Hong Kong was criticised for being late in embracing the city's start-ups, compared with mainland China or even other Asian cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore had five times as many tech venture capital deals last year than in Hong Kong, according to </span><span class="s3">Pitchbook Data</span><span class="s1">. Hong Kong attracted just over US$1 billion in tech venture capital deals, compared to US$2.2 billion in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/22/fda812ba-b25a-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_image_hires_212435.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While a business friendly environment bas been a catalyst for entrepreneurs - it also led to entrenched monopolies, start-up entrepreneurs say, which limit competition and make it difficult for them to make headway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's government is trying to change that. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor outlined major cuts to tax rates amid efforts to expand the innovation and technology sector in her maiden policy speech.“We must develop a high value-added and diversified economy,” she said, adding that Hong Kong had the potential to become the Silicon Valley of Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ICO Investment Club, a cryptocurrency start-up that recently received US$500,000 seed funding from a local venture capital outfit, said GoGoVan and Lalamove's high profile successes may help change that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will let everybody know that investing into a start-up can actually be a very profitable business,” said ICO's co-founder David Tang Chun-yat. “This will unlock a lot of invest opportunities for start-ups.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has tried, with varying success, to encourage a start-up culture in Hong Kong including the massive Cyberport development - which counts GoGoVan among its successful alumni of its Cyberport Incubation Programme - now has close to 1,000 companies as part of its community. “This shows that the whole start-up ecosystem has been growing bigger and better over the recent years,” said Lee George Lam, chairman of Cyberport.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But entrepreneurs say the government still falls short compared to regional neighbours. Casey Lau, an investor who founded StartupsHK, a community for Hong Kong's entrepreneurs, said he too has witnessed a growing acceptance of start-ups - but said government policy had little to do with that. “I'd say we were doing pretty well in a small market with zero help from the government in terms of funding,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tang from ICO agrees. “We think that Hong Kong government is doing a lot better than a few years ago in terms of incentive and policy,” Tang said. “But if we compare it to Singapore and mainland China, we cannot say the Hong Kong government is very supportive [of] start-ups.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Circle, a US cryptocurrency unicorn backed by Chinese investors such as Bitmain, IDG and CreditEase, said its US dollar “stable coin” will start trading on a number of exchanges this week. Circle said it aims to challenge tether, the predominant stable coin that is popular among traders in Asia and elsewhere.We can rebuild the global economic and financial system on top of the blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructureJeremy Allaire, founder and CEO, Circle</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jeremy Allaire, founder and chief executive of Circle, valued at US$3 billion following a US$110 million financing round in May led by cryptocurrency mining chip making giant Bitmain, said its stable coin would be audited by accounting firm Grant Thornton on a monthly basis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of a stable coin is pegged one-to-one to another stable asset, such as the US dollar, and is, hence, less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Used for settlement of cryptocurrency trades, stable coins enable faster settlement times than fiat currency or legal tender.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Circle said its stable coin, USDC, or US Dollar Coin, was fully backed by a US dollar reserve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Bitmain, which is planning a flotation in Hong Kong of up to US$3 billion, has partnered with Circle with the aim of introducing stable coins backed by other fiat currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In becoming our partner for USDC, Bitmain shares a common vision with Circle, in that we can rebuild the global economic and financial system on top of the blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure. A fiat stable coin is a critical part of this infrastructure,” said Allaire.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, many initiatives are aiming to create another stable coin that can challenge tether, the controversial stable coin with a US$2.8 billion market capitalisation. The cryptocurrency with the world's largest market cap is bitcoin, at US$111.87 billion. Tether has not backed up its claim of having a US dollar reserve through an audit by an accounting firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Circle will launch USDC with four reserve bank partners, one of which Allaire said was </span><span class="s3">US Bancorp Asset Management</span><span class="s1">, a subsidiary of </span><span class="s3">US Bank National Association</span><span class="s1">. These partners will receive US dollar deposits from individuals or institutions that want to convert them into USDC, and will hold the dollars in a pool of reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Circle's stable coin will be traded on exchanges such as Huobi, OKEx, DigiFinex and CoinEx, which are popular among traders in China and Hong Kong, and Circle's own exchange, Poloniex.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Circle, founded in 2013 with early backers such as </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese internet giant Baidu, started offering cryptocurrency trading services in Hong Kong in March 2018, targeting institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allaire said other stable coins pegged to other currencies would be announced soon, with Circle being just the first to develop a US dollar version ahead of other financial institutions keen on developing stable coins backed by other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Circle had a bigger ambition - it wants USDC to be a stable coin that can be used to transact and settle conventional financial assets, such as debt, equity, real estate or financing contracts. These securitised assets, implemented on blockchain smart contracts, are today classified by regulators as security tokens. In many jurisdictions, dealings in security tokens are subject to security laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dave Chapman, the chairman of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency broker OSL, said his team had observed a growing demand for stable coins from clients.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Stable coins can provide safety during periods of volatility, as traders can liquidate their positions in a stable coin quickly with the assurance of price stability,” he said. Currently, Octagon supports trading in tether and TrueUSD, another stable coin.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese coffee start-up Luckin has become the latest member of the unicorn club with a reported US$200 million to US$300 million Series A funding round that values the company at over US$1 billion, according to mainland tech news site 36kr.com, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesperson for Lukin said the company had no comment on the report, but last month its top executive indicated that early stage funding was in the works.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our initial [funding] investment will likely exceed one billion yuan (US$156 million),” Jenny Qian Zhiya, chief executive of Luckin Coffee, said in a press briefing in Beijing last month. “We have plenty of cash,” she added, declining to specify exactly how much.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Luckin Coffee, seen as an up-and-coming challenger to </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> in China, is banking on the “new retail” model to achieve success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> is currently China's dominant coffee provider with a market share of about 58.6 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Euromonitor International</span><span class="s1">. It also estimated the coffee shop market in China was worth over US$4.5 billion last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With five million cups sold in the four months since its founding, Lukin Coffee has adopted an on-demand service model and heavy subsidies for its roll-out in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coffee upstart Luckin looks to take on Starbucks in China with ‘new retail' model[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2149516/coffee-upstart-luckin-looks-take-starbucks-china-new-retail-model]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian, the former chief operating officer of China's car rental giant CAR Inc and its ride-hailing affiliate UCAR, founded Luckin with a “soft launch” in Beijing and Shanghai at the start of the year, offering American-style coffee and a range of bakery items.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 525 stores opened so far, 231 or 44 per cent operate like “takeaway kitchens”, according to the company, where coffee is delivered mainly by courier - with a free drink if the order doesn't arrive within half an hour. Luckin has stores in 13 cities serving 1.3 million customers, says the company. It outsources deliveries to SF Express, one of China's largest logistics service providers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian is adamant the company will not just be a “coffee delivery brand”. “We hope to achieve full coverage of targeted areas with delivery kitchens in the first instance, so customers can order our coffee,” she said, adding that the takeaway kitchens will only comprise 15 per cent of its network, with sit-down cafes making up the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian said an attractive new retail model should “combine online with offline” where customers have the choice of enjoying their coffee at a cafe, purchasing via an app for later pickup, or placing direct delivery orders. “New retail” was a term coined by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> founder Jack Ma. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion local trainer John Size doesn't have the best of memories from past Longines Hong Kong International Race meetings, although he produced one of the great training performances to win the Mile with Glorious Days at his first start for six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size has saddled up a number of favourites in the Mile in particular and come away with a string of seconds, some unlucky and none more so than his star Electronic Unicorn in 2002.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most go the barrier draw hoping for gate one but that year Size declared he'd be happy with almost anything except one for Electronic Unicorn - out it came, and cost him the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So, with the trainer heading to Sunday's big events with what he sees as a handful of underdogs, Thursday's kind draws were a masterpiece of poor timing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mixed fortunes at HKIR barrier draw: Lucky Bubbles firms into favouritism, but Able Friend cops outside gate[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2053020/mixed-fortunes-hkir-barrier-draw-lucky-bubbles-firms-favouritism-able]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That usually doesn't happen - they mustn't have much hope!” the laconic handler grimaced after Amazing Kids (barrier seven in the Sprint), Eastern Express (two in the Vase) and Mile runners Sun Jewellery (three) and Contentment (six), all pulled low gates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size's race over the years has tended to be the Mile and he has a pair of very honest and worthwhile chances on Sunday.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Contentment is very straightforward, makes his own luck on the speed and he never does much wrong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I know his jockey, Brett Prebble, feels he hasn't been running to his best but I can't find anything wrong with him at home so we keep taking him to the races and he wasn't beaten far in the lead-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Sun Jewellery is a Group One winner against his own age and it's tougher against open ages but he has some more rating improvement left in him. He was very fresh first-up then improved a lot to run very competitively in the main lead-up for third and he's fitter now.”?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Staying-bred Eastern Express gets his baptism of fire over 2,400m against highly accomplished stayers in the Vase and there is the danger it is all happening too quickly, but Size shrugs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eastern Express was a very late foal so everything comes too soon. The Derby was too soon, this race is too soon but we get few opportunities to run at 2,400m so we have to try him, even if he's eligible for much easier races domestically,” Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And you have to remember that, although he has been behind, there will come a time where he is catching up to the more mature horses and they will have peaked and then he will come into his own.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he reserves his greatest (underdog) confidence for Amazing Kids, a rising star last season who should have been much closer in his last crack at this kind of company when severe interference prevented him finishing closer than fifth to Chautauqua in May.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He looked fairly ordinary last start but had a pretty demanding race the previous run and I think that might have taken a bit out of him,” Size explained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That's the idea I'm working with anyway. This looks a fast race, which will suit him, and hopefully he can get back to his better form and be getting into it late as the leaders are tiring.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I'm not expecting to win one but I do think I can get some prizemoney and the Hong Kong horses usually get their best chance in the Sprint so it's probably my best chance too.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The race to develop Hong Kong's next "unicorn" may be heating up, with the launch on Monday of a start-up accelerator with a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike the city's numerous existing incubators, the two-year Sprinter programme will focus on both start-ups and the angel investors who typically provide their capital between the seed and venture-capital funding stages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With an overall aim of fostering a sustainable ecosystem of innovation and astute early-stage investors, Sprinter offers an "entrepreneur track" for at least 120 technology start-ups and a parallel "business angel track" for mentoring 40 individuals on how to evaluate deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a three-way initiative between </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, the Hong Kong and Science Technology Parks Corp (HKSTP) and the Hong Kong Business Angel Network, and will be open for applications at the end of November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How a high-school dropout with big ideas founded GoGoVan, Hong Kong's first US$1bn start-up[http://www.scmp.com/tech/leaders-founders/article/2109032/how-high-school-dropout-big-ideas-founded-gogovan-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology companies need knowledge and resources in various fields to develop strong business acumen, as they turn their innovative ideas into marketable products," said Albert Wong Hak-keung, the chief executive of the HKSTP, at the launch of Sprinter on Monday at the sprawling Hong Kong Science Park in Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The investor community also requires an extensive network and domain expertise for generating quality deals."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Business Angel Network, a non-profit organisation, was formed in 2010 by the HKSTP, the Hong Kong Venture Capital Association and four of the city's largest universities to serve as a platform to match investors with entrepreneurs. There are about 100 active angel investors working with the network.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While HSBC[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=5&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] has been one of the most active banks in supporting accelerator programmes[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2088931/hsbc-and-17-other-financial-firms-heat-race-fintech-talent-hong-kong] in Hong Kong, Sprinter is its first to involve an investor-education component.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe the Sprinter programme can attract talented and ambitious people, helping enhance the city's competitiveness," said Terence Chiu, the head of commercial banking at </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKSTP chief technology officer George Tee said the number of start-ups in the programme will be pared down to 10 after five months, and receive intensive training on business expansion and fundraising strategies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are open to all disciplines, not just fintech or electronics," said Tee. "We're hoping to have more unicorns develop in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2114962/all-you-need-know-about-high-flying-unicorns-gogovan-and-lalamove], but more importantly, see the city established as a regional innovation and technology hub."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of China's Greater Bay Area plan[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2076221/beijing-throws-weight-behind-ambitious-greater-bay-area], Hong Kong's economy is to be closely integrated with those of the mainland's rich coastal provinces, while finding more opportunities to boost research and development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Haswell, a partner at international law firm </span><span class="s3">Pinsent Masons</span><span class="s1">, said Sprinter's goal of nurturing both investors and start-ups was "a solid step to prove Hong Kong was serious about becoming a tech hub".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I've seen a lot of angel investor programmes, but never one that combined start-up training," Haswell said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total deal activity in venture capital-backed companies in Asia reached US$16.5 billion across 747 transactions in the third quarter, according to data from PwC and CB Insights' recent MoneyTree report.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing champion jockey Zac Purton kept his cool and kept his faint hopes of another century of wins alive with a winning Sha Tin double.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It might almost have been a reprise of his winning Derby ride on Luger as the Australian guided home Spicy Sure for Manfred Man Ka-leung in the seventh race, when Purton was caught wide all the way but stayed focused on the basics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was a pretty good effort to win like that - the pace wasn't slow enough for me to keep going forward and it wasn't fast enough that I could go back, so there wasn't a lot I could do," he said. "But I just kept the horse in his rhythm and balanced and when I asked him to go he got to the front quite comfortably, and then he was strong at the finish. He beat a couple of nice horses today, he gives the impression he'll run further than 1,400m and he looks like he might have a nice future."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thirty minutes before, Purton had an easier ride to victory as Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained Unicorn broke his maiden in style when the three-year-old finally struck a well-run race. Third-placed Born To Win scooted clear midrace with a big break in the 1,600m Class Four but his apprentice rider might have just gone a touch too quick.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The one time he was forward in a race, he flopped. He's a backmarker, that's his style, and I didn't want to be closer so when the pace was on that really helped," said Purton. "I quite like Unicorn as a horse with some upside. He's very honest, beautiful to do anything with and he's got a great attitude. I think later on he'll stay so he should be able to progress next season."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purton was only the second jockey to join Douglas Whyte in the century club winning the championship last season, Joao Moreira has joined them in securing the title this term, and it's still mathematically possible Purton could get 100 wins but he will need a boom run of form in the final eight meetings for the 15 he needs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Young Hongkongers who feel trapped by their circumstances need only look to entrepreneur Steven Lam Hoi-yuen for inspiration. His company, GoGoVan, will become Hong Kong's first "unicorn", or start-up valued at more than US$1 billion, after it merges with the mainland firm 58 Suyun. The goal is to create the world's biggest short-distance logistics platform, a conceivable objective given how far the business has come in so short a time. It is a story we are familiar with from California's hi-tech hub Silicon Valley, but not from our own city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam, 31, is no different to those who put Silicon Valley on the tech map; he has vision, a strong work ethic and the ability to make timely decisions and act on them. But he is also from a humble background, having come from a low-income family and grown up on a Kowloon public housing estate. He had a patchy education record until paying his way to community college in the United States and eventually graduating from the respected business school at </span><span class="s3">University of California, Berkeley</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How a high-school dropout with big ideas founded GoGoVan, Hong Kong's first US$1bn start-up[https://www.scmp.com/tech/leaders-founders/article/2109032/how-high-school-dropout-big-ideas-founded-gogovan-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To fund his schooling, he worked as a delivery boy for a Chinese restaurant, sold items on </span><span class="s3">eBay</span><span class="s1"> and repaired computers. Unable to find a suitable job on his return to Hong Kong, his entrepreneurial spirit kicked in and GoGoVan was his third start-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan is an old idea given a technological makeover. Through a smartphone application, customers and drivers are connected so goods may be delivered quickly. Lam, now chief executive, was among five co-founders who pooled HK$20,000 in 2013 and later raised US$16.5 million to create a firm that now operates in more than a dozen Chinese cities and three other Asian countries. It has tens of thousands of vehicles and drivers on call.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Way to go, GoGoVan! Unicorn reveals global goals after merger with 58 Suyun[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2108854/way-go-gogovan-unicorn-reveals-global-goals-after-merger-58]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A home-grown success story is inspirational, but Lam also believes youngsters should be putting their savings into something more than property. "If your dream is to buy a house, then at the end of the day, all you have is a house," he says. It is sage advice for those who do not work hard, ignore opportunities and shun adventure in favour of expecting authorities to meet their every demand.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu, China's answer to </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, announced on Wednesday it had raised US$120 million in a funding round, officially making the five-year-old start-up a "unicorn" - a private company with a valuation of US$1 billion or more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funding round was led by Jack Ma-backed Yunfeng Capital and included existing investors, such as Morningside Venture Capital and Capital Today. The investment is expected to offer Beijing-based Xiaozhu not only a war chest but also the strategic resources needed to consolidate its leading position in China's rapidly growing home-sharing market amid the rise of San Francisco-based giant </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the scale-effect of our home-sharing network, we are able to bring in profit ourselves. What we care more about are the strategic resources brought by our investors," Kelvin Chen, the chief executive of Xiaozhu, told the Post in an exclusive interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the potential opportunities for cooperation with </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, that will help Xiaozhu in its battle with the traditional hotel industry and in offering better experiences to Chinese travellers, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital injection comes amid reinforced efforts by </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> to crack the China market. This year, the world's largest home-sharing company, with a valuation of about US$30 billion, pledged to invest as much as it needed to expand in China, where it has 120,000 listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu is on track for 300,000 listings by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How China's Airbnb copycats beat the Silicon Valley titan at its own game[http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/business/article/2074802/how-chinas-airbnb-copycats-beat-silicon-valley-titan-its-own-game]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu is often called China's </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, but Chen said the company does not benchmark its growth against any rivals in the home-sharing business. "What matters for us is how to provide our customers with better services than hotels. We have no reason to worry about the development of a US company in China. It will be a positive force, pushing the development of the industry forward, but it will never be the market leader in China," said Chen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the latest round of funding, Xiaozhu has now raised a total of US$270 million in five rounds of financing, and the next step for the company is an initial public offering overseas. Chen confirmed that Xiaozhu had put an IPO plan on its agenda but no detailed timetable had been set up. The uncertainty over the timing of the IPO was because of regulatory concerns, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has given its blessing to the development of the sharing economy, but the operation of home-sharing is still a grey area with no regulatory details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu is expected to use </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s smart technologies to improve its customer experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have already established a service chain with a network of professional photographers and cleaners to make it easy for the Chinese to rent out their flats online, and to make it easy for travellers to enjoy standard services in homestyle flats. We are going to keep investing to make these services available in more cities in China," said Chen.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the help of facial recognition technology, China's biggest home-sharing start-up believes it has the solution to the regulatory uncertainty holding back full development of the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu, China's answer to </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, will use the peak travel season of Chinese New Year to begin testing smart locks that can be opened by scanning tenants' faces, which would satisfy laws requiring identify verification.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As regulation remains unclear, Xiaozhu hopes to use the power of technology to find common ground with authorities. Regulators can wait, but with the pace of technology we can't,” the company's chief executive Kelvin Chen said in an interview on the sidelines of the Wuzhen World Internet Conference on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Facial recognition is seeing rapid development in China as part of the nation's wider push to become a leader in artificial intelligence, with the technology used in applications ranging from suspect identification in law enforcement to payment authorisation for fast food purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How Chinese firms went from copycat to copy that[http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/business/article/2110992/e-commerce-bike-shares-how-chinese-firms-went-copycat-copy]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the Chinese government has given its blessing to development of the sharing economy, home sharing remains a grey area. Hotels are required by law to register the identity of their lodgers but providers of home-rentals using a password lock can only verify who makes the booking, not who actually stays in the room.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu will start installing the lock system, which was co-developed with </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, in March or April after initial tests are carried out, said Chen. The move comes a month after the company announced its latest funding round led by Jack Ma-backed Yunfeng Capital, which vaulted Xiaozhu into the ranks of China's unicorns - private firms valued at US$1 billion or more. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is backed by Ma's </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smart locks strategy is expected to give the home sharing unicorn a leg up against US-based </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> when it comes to the mainland China market, amid the latter's pledge to invest as much as it needs to expand in a market it considers of “fundamental importance”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While crediting his US rival as having first-mover advantage in China, Chen is confident the mainland Chinese home-sharing market will be bigger and grow faster than the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China has less cultural, customs or legal barriers when it comes to a sharing economy. Although the market may start off slow, Chinese companies move quickly when it comes to upgrading [travel] infrastructure and combining online technology with the offline environment,” Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen also expects Xiaozhu to adopt </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">'s credit investigation analysis tools as a step towards scrapping down payment or deposit requirements for certain renters, as well as work with Alibaba's travel service provider Fliggy in opening up new channels for the promotion of rental listings.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are discussing an extensive partnership with Alibaba and its affiliates,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaozhu has over 200,000 listings in China and a presence in 80 overseas cities. </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, with a valuation of about US$30 billion, is the world's biggest home-sharing platform, with about 120,000 listings in China after expanding its operation over the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen, who worked as a doctor before founding Xiaozhu in 2012, confirmed that there are plans for a public listing but he was “in no rush”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As regulation globally is still unclear, we might as well let sharing companies like Uber or </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> get listed first and see how it works for them,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen said Xiaozhu is profitable and the timetable for an IPO can be determined by how aggressively the company wants to push its brand campaign. “The market is driven by demand instead of operations or promotion. And there is just more demand to fill.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is many an entrepreneur's dream to raise the first million dollars, then move beyond Hong Kong to conquer other markets. But to do that, a good concept is not enough, because even the best idea requires large amounts of blood and sweat as well as a never-say-die attitude, as one start-up founder put it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It doesn't matter if a hundred people reject you, what matters is that [at least] one person believes in your vision," said Shing Chow, co-founder and CEO of Lalamove, an online vehicle delivery sharing service with a mobile app previously dubbed the "Uber for logistics"[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/1856230/uber-logistics-lalamove-raises-another-us10-million-hong-kong-start].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2013, the firm started with a three-person team in an incubation programme at the Science Park. It has raised US$60 million from investors such as venture capital firm MindWorks, and has operations in 81 cities including Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and Taipei. It also operates in mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Surge in Hong Kong start-ups as more young people shun safe career paths[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2059332/surge-hong-kong-start-ups-more-young-people-shun-safe-career]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow, 39, said he was contemplating listing the company in Hong Kong or overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Finding an investor is not like being a boyfriend who must keep to one partner. You should see as many people as possible," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Because Hong Kong has never had a very successful start-up, venture capitalists are reluctant to invest. They want to catch a unicorn - a firm with a valuation of US$1 billion. We want to be the first unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/12/82815c7a-4d0d-11e7-a842-aa003dd7e62a_image_hires_083347.png]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Transportation is a very old business. But there was a huge opportunity to revolutionise the delivery van service through the internet. The ordering and matching of vans used to be made by voice through a call centre. We digitised it," Chow said, adding that the location of moving vans can be tracked in real time, allowing an efficient match of logistics supply and delivery demand.Finding an investor is not like being a boyfriend who must keep to one partner. You should see as many people as possibleShing Chow, Lalamove CEO</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other companies such as GoGoVan are also in the delivery van-sharing business. But Chow claimed that unlike ride-sharing company Uber, which is facing regulatory hurdles[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2062917/legalise-and-regulate-ride-hailing-apps-hong-kong-uber-chief] throughout the world, regulation of the delivery business for goods was "not so strict".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow graduated with an economics degree from </span><span class="s3">Stanford University</span><span class="s1"> and scored 10 distinctions in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination in 1995.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has quite a colourful past, having spent several years in Macau as a "professional gambler", where he said he won his "first bucket of gold".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2013, he teamed up with co-founder Gary Hui, who now spends most of his time opening up new markets for their business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/12/173609f6-4d0e-11e7-a842-aa003dd7e62a_image_hires_083347.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Each market is so different. We used to be called Easyvan. But when we went to Bangkok to expand our business, we realised all the deliveries were done by motorbike, so we changed our name to Lalamove," Hui said, adding that the firm now also used motorcycles in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We needed US$100 million to do what we wanted to do," Chow said. That is a long way from the HK$300,000 in seed funding Lalamove received from the Science Park's "incu-app programme" that kick-started its development.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow has since returned to Science Park events to share his experience, especially with consultation on a new trading board starting this month. The platform will provide new funding opportunities for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no shortage of talent and investors in Hong Kong. The key is to match them efficiently," Science Park CEO Albert Wong Hak-keung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The city's culture towards start-ups needs to change. The Science Park has been trying hard to build an ecosystem for start-ups which involves investors, because we believe technology is the future of Hong Kong's economy."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UrWork, China's largest office-space sharing start-up, is still firmly focused on the home market even as it pushes into Europe in an effort to extend its battle lines with US rival WeWork.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based company, backed by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial and Sequoia Capital, is targeting 10 cities globally, with Europe's first batch of sites to open in London, Paris and Berlin in the second half of next year, Mao Daqing, UrWork's founder and chairman, told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The primary goal is to serve "Chinese businesses venturing overseas" in "young and dynamic cities" worldwide, said the property veteran, who was vice-president of the country's third-largest developer Vanke for half a decade before founding UrWork in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are confident of achieving a 60 per cent occupancy rate within the first three months of opening, and reaching 80 per cent within six to nine months," he said, adding that specific locations are not yet known as deals are being finalised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Office-space sharing, a concept that originated in North America as a result of start-up culture, provides entrepreneurs with work and meeting space room at a fraction of the cost of maintaining a traditional office.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The multibillion-dollar business has become a focal point for venture capitalists, with SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> both betting big on the sector. UrWork was valued at more than 8 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) in its latest fundraising round, making it China's first unicorn - a start-up worth over US$1 billion - in the shared work space sector, while its US rival WeWork saw its valuation hit US$20 billion in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The concept of co-working has taken hold in China over the past three years, thanks to the country's proliferation of start-ups and an increasing number of customers embracing the sharing lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Mao noted that the market was still in its infancy and that it will take another five years for the concept of co-working to gain mainstream acceptance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are still in the customer education phase, but China has greatest potential in the years to come," Mao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With 88 co-working sites in 25 Chinese cities, UrWork is the country's largest player in the field. Its tenants range from bike-sharing start-up Ofo and video-streaming platform Bilibili to bigger tech conglomerates like Amazon China and NetEase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company plans to expand globally into 32 cities with 160 sites over the next three years, which would see its total floor area under management reach 700,000 square metres.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SenseTime Group, a high-flying start-up based in the Hong Kong Science Park, has formed a strategic collaboration with mobile chip giant </span><span class="s3">Qualcomm Technologies</span><span class="s1"> that will expand its expertise in artificial intelligence technologies into a broad range of devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Together we'll push the envelope and extend AI to places that are currently beyond reach," Xu Li, co-founder and chief executive of SenseTime, said in a statement on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our strategic collaboration will become a turning point for the whole AI ecosystem."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Qualcomm</span><span class="s1"> and SenseTime expect to drive the popularity and development of on-device AI in areas such as innovative vision and camera-based image processing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said the first public demonstration of their collaboration will be held in Shenzhen during the China Public Security Expo, which will run from October 29 to November 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The alliance with </span><span class="s3">Qualcomm</span><span class="s1"> marks a new milestone for SenseTime, which completed in July its US$410 million Series B round of funding round from a group of nearly 20 investors that vaulted the company to "unicorn" status with a valuation of around US$1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That transaction was the single largest financing round in AI history to date. A unicorn is a start-up that is valued at US$1 billion or more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SenseTime has made a name for itself in so-called deep learning, a subset of machine learning technology in AI. It now has offices located in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Tokyo and Kyoto.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2014, SenseTime now has more than 400 customers and strategic partners, according to Shang Hailong, SenseTime's managing director based in Hong Kong.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Qualcomm</span><span class="s1"> has been conducting fundamental research in AI over a decade," said Kressin. "In fact, many devices shipping today using our Snapdragon mobile platforms already utilise on-device AI."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said </span><span class="s3">Qualcomm</span><span class="s1"> expected its collaboration with SenseTime "to further accelerate new and exciting capabilities of on-device AI for millions of consumers using mobile devices".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting is the new "King of Class Five” - taking over the mantle held by Frankie Lor Fu-chuen last season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rookie trainer is off to a flying start - he is second on the championship table behind Tony Cruz, yet has had fewer runners (88) than all but Paul O'Sullivan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting has made do with retreads and his formula of getting his horses "fit and happy” is working wonders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holy Unicorn was 0-27 before the start of this season but is now 3-4 since joining Jimmy Ting. The five-year-old makes virtually all under Dylan Mo in R1 at Sha Tin to give Ting his 18th win at a strike rate of better than one in five. #HKracing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKracing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/0VGs9dBOjC[https://t.co/0VGs9dBOjC]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) December 2, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1069099135041626112]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Class Five alone, he has had 10 winners (plus another five placegetters) from 25 starters - good for a rock-solid 40 per cent strike rate. It is even more impressive considering there have been just 34 races of that type this term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holy Unicorn has been the banner horse for his team, winning three and climbing from a rating of 19 to 41, so his next start will be in Class Four.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting is following the blueprint set by Lor last season, who had an astonishing 16 winners in Class Five from 37 runners (43.2 per cent) just to the end of December.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since January, he has had only one Class Five winner, while he has had just two starters in the cellar grade this term. Owners have given him better horses so he simply does not have the cattle to compete there any more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting's early success means he is following a similar direction - he only has seven horses still eligible for the grade and that will continue to drop as he acquires fresh stock and those winners lift themselves up the ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of those horses is Richcity Fortune, who competes in the second race at Happy Valley on Wednesday night, and given the trainer's form, it would not shock to see him back in the winner's circle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's internet users increased at the fastest pace in three years as the abundant availability of internet-enabled smart phones spurred usage and increased the penetration rate in the world's most populous nation, according to a report by the state agency responsible for the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese internet market expanded 6.2 per cent in 2016, gaining 43 million internet users --equivalent to the population of a Ukraine or Argentina -- to put the total number of users at 731 million, according to data by the China Internet Network Information Centre. Penetration rate rose by 3.1 percentage points to 53.2 per cent, the CINIC data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 2016 growth pace has slowed from the double-digit clip that was recorded five years ago, when smart phones first became the engine driving the country's internet usage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Already, 95.1 per cent of China's users, or 695 million people, access the internet through their phones, with the growth rate rising to a plateau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increasing penetration rate marks the end of the era when internet companies can simply rely on the growth of the overall user population to bolster their traffic and usage. Now they have to work harder to attract visitors to their sites, or to download their applications, requiring billions in development, marketing and subsidy dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you are a startup, and you still pin your hope on mobile internet, there is little hope that you can become a unicorn in this era, because the market has entered a period of flat development,” </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1">'s founder and chief executive Robin Li said during a December industry conference. A unicorn is a start-up valued at over $1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu, operator of China's dominant internet search engine, has invested billions in artificial intelligence, with applications in problem-solving bots to self-driving automobiles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xue Yu, an analyst with IDC, said the government's guidance on internet industry development, released a week ago, stressed the content control and cyber security, which could increase the cost of internet content production. Under increased regulation and fading population dividend, “stability” will be the theme of China's internet industry.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first artificial intelligence (AI) unicorn SenseTime and </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> have jointly launched an AI laboratory in the city to advance the technology and help build a start-up community in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dubbed the HK AI Lab and funded by SenseTime and the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, the laboratory will be outfitted with so-called supercomputers and technology developed by Alibaba's global research programme, the Alibaba DAMO Academy, which stands for “Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook”. Researchers will also have access to Alibaba Cloud's machine learning platform and SenseTime's deep-learning platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SenseTime, which has dual-headquarters in Hong Kong and Beijing and specialises in systems that analyse faces and images on an enormous scale, became a unicorn last year and is currently valued at US$3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese AI start-up SenseTime snags Alibaba funding at a record US$3 billion valuation[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2140840/chinese-ai-start-sensetime-snags-alibaba-funding-record-us3-billion]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lab will collaborate with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) to roll out a six-month accelerator programme to nurture AI start-ups in Hong Kong. The accelerator will offer funding, relevant technologies, and working space to selected AI start-ups as the city looks to cultivate a local technology talent pool and encourage more start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In Hong Kong, there are a group of outstanding researchers in universities working on AI and we hope that the AI Lab will serve as an open platform that can give them more scenarios to apply their research,” said Cindy Chow, executive director of the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund and an advisory board member of the AI Lab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has always relied on professional services, financial services and real estate [for economic growth], but Alibaba and SenseTime believe that AI will create new industries and new jobs ... to help Hong Kong's economy sustain its competitiveness.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the lab will also work with corporations to connect researchers with the private sector so they can work together to find AI solutions for commercial use.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The launch of the lab comes as Hong Kong's government looks to step up innovation in high-technology areas like AI, biotechnology and financial technology to prevent the city from falling behind. The government's budget for this year included HK$40 billion for HKSTP to support innovation and technology building. A separate amount of HK$10 billion was earmarked to establish two technology research clusters focusing on health care technology and AI.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The launch of the AI lab and accelerator programme comes amid intensifying competition between mainland China and the United States for dominance of AI technologies, which are vital to enable an array of emerging applications from talking robots to self-driving cars. China is pouring billions of dollars into its AI efforts. Last week the city of Tianjin said it will establish a 100 billion yuan (US$15.7 billion) fund to speed up development of new generation AI technologies, and in January China's capital Beijing announced a plan to build a 13.8 billion yuan AI development park that would house up to 400 enterprises with an estimated annual output of 50 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong AI Lab's accelerator programme will begin in September this year, with two intakes annually selecting about six to 10 start-ups each time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Selected start-ups will receive US$100,000 in funding from the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, a not-for-profit initiative by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, in return for 6 per cent in equity. Any return on investment will be channelled back into the fund to support initiatives that will help bolster AI in the Greater China region.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan and 58 Suyun plan to expand in mainland China and Southeast Asia after merging, aiming to become the number one intra-city logistics platform in the world, company officials said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The merged company, which will use the name GoGoVan in English and 58 Suyun in Chinese, plans to extend its reach to 200 more Chinese cities. It said it will start providing services to corporate clients in 40 mainland cities, and step into more Southeast Asian markets in the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The goal of our merged company is to become the world's largest short-distance logistics platform," said Steven Lam, co-founder and chief executive of GoGoVan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The intra-city logistics market in mainland China is currently worth around 800 billion yuan (US$121 billion) for the business-to-business segment, and 400 billion yuan for business-to-consumer. These are expected to grow 20 and 15 per cent respectively annually over the next few years, according to research from Deloitte China.We might look like a logistics version of Uber now, but we may become the coolest hi-tech company in Asia Pacific in the futureSteven Lam, chief executive, GoGoVan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The merged company would be a "unicorn," a start-up valued at over US$1 billion, said Lam, declining to give a specific valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two firms were not competitive and will complement each other with strengths in different markets and service types, said Chen Xiaohua, chief executive of 58 Home, which owns the business unit 58 Suyun. 58 Home is operated by New York-listed </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">, of which Chinese internet giant Tencent is the largest shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While 58 Suyun focuses on individual customers in over 100 mainland Chinese cities, GoGoVan operates in six Asian markets - Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, India and mainland China - where it has strong corporate client bases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2013 by five young Hongkongers with just HK$20,000, GoGoVan is an on-demand van hailing app which generates revenues from charging customers and drivers a fee. One of its main competitors in Hong Kong is Lalamove.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">58 Suyun needs to have a better team to "embrace the larger international market," said Chen. GoGoVan's team was "undoubtedly our best choice" as they rapidly expanded from Hong Kong into Southeast Asia, a market difficult for Chinese young people to understand, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Both entities were leading players in their markets before they merged," said John Song, consulting partner at Deloitte China, who leads the logistics and transportation sub-sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The merge could give them an edge, as "most of their competitors are either within mainland China or within other markets," said Song.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">58 Suyun will hold the majority stake in the combined company. 58 Home's biggest institutional shareholder </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which runs the world's largest online shopping platform, "provided a lot of support and actively facilitated the merger," said Chen. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This matches well with Alibaba's larger strategy of expanding into logistics and e-commerce in Southeast Asia and promoting "new retail," or the integration of online, offline, logistics and data across a single value chain, Song said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The merged company also plans to test new energy and self-driving vehicles in around three years, Chen said. "We might look like a logistics version of Uber now, but we may become the coolest hi-tech company in Asia Pacific in the future," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new firm will "definitely choose Hong Kong" for a listing if it decides to go public one day, said Lam.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An offshoot of Baidu, China's dominant online search engine operator, has led a US$156 million funding round into the country's leading online trucking platform, as it ramps up its effort to use artificial intelligence to reshape the booming transportation industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Truck Alliance, an ‘Uber-type' service to book trucks, known locally as “Huochebang (貨車幫)”, said on Tuesday it had completed a new round of financing led by Baidu Capital, the firm's investment arm which focusses on mid- and late-stage deals in the internet sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu launches 20 billion yuan investment fund for start-ups[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2027490/baidu-launches-20-billion-yuan-investment-fund-start-ups]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2027490/baidu-launches-20-billion-yuan-investment-fund-start-ups]Huochebang was founded in 2014 in southwest China's Guizhou province and is also backed by Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings and private equity firm All-Stars Investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It operates by matching vehicles nationally with commodity producers in need of transport.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also provides follow-up services, including helping find parking lots, and sells GPS and ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) devices for highway transportation, as well as making money from the sale of toll cards and commissions on the card top-ups, as well as helping truckers with financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest capital injection follows a US$115 million fundraising in December, which crowned Huochebang as a “Unicorn”, private companies valued at US$1 billion or more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to mainland media, some 200 major companies are competing in China's trillion yuan logistics industry, with most betting big on internet-enabled truck-cargo matching platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Huochebang is considered “the largest and the only nationwide platform in China”, said Wu Wenjie, managing partner of Baidu Capital, in a statement.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dai Wenjian, Huochebang's founder, told a Beijing forum last month the company has connected some 2.6 million trucks with around 400,000 logistic companies in China, and is set to deliver a profit in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest investment comes at a time when Baidu is gearing up to rebuilt itself as an artificial intelligence(AI)-focused company, and transportation is seen by it as a key future earner.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month it announced it was making its self-driving vehicle platform open source, which means car makers around the world can tap into its technology to develop autonomous vehicles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As well investing in Huochebang, Baidu Capital - which manages 20 billion yuan (US$2.87 billion) worth of investments - has also backed Nio, the electric car startup formerly known as </span><span class="s3">NextEV</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jennifer Li, Baidu's chief financial officer, is taking over as CEO of Baidu Capital after nine years in her current post, Baidu said last Friday while reporting its first quarter financial performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Unlike its peers such as Tencent or Alibaba, Baidu has missed out on many good investment targets in the mobile internet arena, and so it has now placed greater emphasis on mergers and acquisitions,” said Shi Jialong, analyst with Nomura.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiger Brokers, an online securities brokerage backed by Wall Street billionaire investor Jim Rogers, said its latest fundraising round had valued it in excess of US$1 billion, making it the latest start-up to join China's booming club of unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company successfully closed a US$80 million Series C financing, bringing the company's valuation to US$1.06 billion, the Chinese fintech stock brokerage said in a press release on Wednesday. The latest round was a co-investment led by Prospect Avenue Capital (PAC), Orient Hontai Capital and Oceanpine Capital. A unicorn is a privately held start-up company with a current valuation of US$1 billion or more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The newly-raised capital will be used to boost research and development as well as investment in new talent, said Wu Tianhua, founder of Tiger Brokers, adding that the company also aims to accelerate its development of an all-in-one global asset allocation platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiger Brokers offers an app that allows Chinese investors, including ethnic Chinese stationed outside mainland China, to trade US stocks, Hong Kong-listed stocks and China A shares via the stock connect scheme between Hong Kong and mainland bourses. This offers Chinese investors with assets outside the mainland alternative investment opportunities at a time when the domestic market has underperformed global peers due to uncertainties connected with the escalation of US China trade tensions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in June 2014, Tiger has seen the accumulated trading volume on its mobile trading app Tiger Trade reach US$150 billion, according to the release.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Infiniti Motor Company</span><span class="s1">, the Hong Kong-based luxury vehicle division of Japanese carmaker </span><span class="s3">Nissan</span><span class="s1">, aims to add another name to the city's nascent billion-dollar-start-up club, with the launch of a new accelerator programme focused on consumer retail innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's going to take some time. But if we do our job right, these start-ups should go on to raise more equity, grow their business and get themselves in a position to become the next unicorn,” said Dane Fisher, the general manager for global business transformation and brand at Infiniti on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fisher told SCMP that the point of accelerators is to help nurture more good companies to challenge the status quo and create an ecosystem built on fresh concepts and new business models wanted by consumers, which are attributes exemplified by on-demand logistics services providers GoGoVan and Lalamove.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan became the city's first unicorn - a start-up valued at US$1 billion or more - last month after merging with 58 Suyun, the freight business of mainland Chinese online classifieds giant 58 Home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While this week Lalamove raised US$100 million in its latest funding round to lift its valuation at close to US$1 billion, providing a boost to its expansion plans across Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Infiniti</span><span class="s1"> has teamed up with Nest, the city's pre-eminent early-stage venture capital firm for technology start-ups, to launch Infiniti Lab Global Accelerator 3.0, which follows their 2015 accelerator in Hong Kong that focused on so-called smart city development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seven start-ups, including local firms Cove and actiMirror, were selected from more than 130 applications from around the world. Other participants are from Canada, Germany, Mexico, Sweden and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Start-ups helps us see into the future, so our programme is constantly evolving and improving as a test bed where daring happens,” Fisher said.It's going to take some time. But if we do our job right, these start-ups should go on to raise more equity, grow their business and get themselves in a position to become the next unicornDane Fisher, the general manager for global business transformation and brand at Infiniti</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lawrence Morgan, the chief executive at Nest, said the 10-week Infiniti Lab accelerator included intensive business coaching and mentoring, as well as access to the luxury carmaker's network of executives and ecosystem partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The programme will conclude with a so-called Demo Day on December 13, providing the start-ups a platform to pitch their ideas to a panel of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the promising on-demand retail tech start-ups taking part in the programme is Toronto-based Rover Parking, which founder Tim Wootton described as “the </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> of parking” - providing a similar concept to the popular online marketplace for short-term lodging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are helping increase the supply of parking spaces, without having to spend money on building new car parks,” Wootton said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total global funding for on-demand tech start-ups grew 455 per cent to US$10 billion across 87 deals in the second quarter, up from US$1.8 billion in the same period last year, according to venture capital database service CB Insights.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Closer economic integration between Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in Guangdong province within the ambitious Greater Bay Area plan is expected to foster the development of Hong Kong's next “unicorn” start-up in the electronics sector, according to experts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I'm very positive that this could happen very soon,” Simon Yu, the president of Arrow Electronics' components business in the Asia-Pacific, told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Under that environment, we will see more start-ups connect the dots and become part of the world's technology innovation value chain.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Increased awareness about local hi-tech start-ups' opportunity to join the ranks of companies worth more than US$1 billion follows recent news of Hong Kong logistics company GoGoVan accomplishing that feat.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month it agreed to merge with 58 Suyun, the freight business of mainland Chinese online classifieds giant 58 Home, to create the city's first unicorn.We will see more unicorns in Hong Kong.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will see more unicorns in Hong Kong. The GoGoVan deal shows there is incredible potential for start-ups arising out of the Greater Bay Area initiative,” said Paul Haswell, a partner at international law firm </span><span class="s3">Pinsent Masons</span><span class="s1">. “Any opportunity to be in touch with investors on a wider scale is to be welcomed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premier Li Keqiang announced the Greater Bay Area plan in March as part of an urbanisation push, which would create clusters that leverage the strength of first-tier cities to help spark growth in less-developed cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Greater Bay Area is forecast to achieve US$3.6 trillion in annual economic output by 2037, up from US$1.3 trillion in 2015, according to research published last month by global real estate services company, </span><span class="s3">Colliers International</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrow's Yu pointed out that the current technology innovation supply chain creates situations in which “certain ideas originate from the United States, new technology come from advanced markets like Germany, app development is done in Hong Kong and manufacturing is in mainland China”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you're an electronics start-up, the Greater Bay Area could make things easier to connect the dots for projects amid the scale of manufacturing done in cities like Shenzhen and Zhuhai,” Yu said.If you're an electronics start-up, the Greater Bay Area could make things easier to connect the dots for projects amid the scale of manufacturing done in cities like Shenzhen and ZhuhaiSimon Yu, president of Arrow Electronics' components business in the Asia-Pacific</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Arrow's part, he said the company has helped electronics-related start-ups in the city initiate about 700 projects over the past 15 months through its Open Lab facility, located in phase 2 of the Hong Kong Science Park in Shatin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listed in New York, Arrow is a global provider of products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronics components and enterprise computing systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Pinsent Masons</span><span class="s1">' Haswell said the electronics sector's position in cities including Shenzhen, Dongguan and Zhuhai could lead to “more mainland companies looking to Hong Kong start-ups for innovation and potential acquisitions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company last Friday opened its expanded Open Lab facility in a bid to offer more electronics start-ups free services, as well as support the “Sensor Hub” internet of things technology project led by the Hong Kong Science and </span><span class="s3">Technology Parks Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The internet of things represents a super network, consisting of internet-linked devices embedded in everyday objects that gather, send and receive data, as well as controlled via mobile application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu said Arrow currently helps plenty of Hong Kong start-ups in both consumer and industrial internet of things projects through its in-house expertise, links with suppliers and its portfolio of more than 14,000 different sensors used for various applications.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore could be where start-ups prefer to set up shop, but Hong Kong is the market that they want to list in, according to analysts and industry players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Singapore government</span><span class="s1"> has introduced many measures to support start-ups, which is why it has attracted many new companies to set up there. However, these start-ups would get bigger and want to go public, Hong Kong is a better choice as the overall market size and new listing activities are more active in Hong Kong than in Singapore," said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore in terms of drawing start-ups to establish on its turf. The latest case is Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange, or Lufax, the peer-to-peer lender that was established by Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm was last month given the green light to launch a global wealth management platform by the </span><span class="s3">Monetary Authority of Singapore</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the overall Hong Kong IPO market is more robust. It has raised four times more funds than Singapore so far this year, totalling US$8 billion in 92 IPOs. The island republic has raised only US$2 billion from 13 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is the world's fourth-largest IPO market worldwide while Singapore is not even in the top 10 list. But the flip side is Hong Kong is losing out in the amount of funds raised from technology IPOs as Singapore is ranked fifth, while the city is in the 12th position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is because the majority of funds raised in Hong Kong IPOs were from traditional firms with financial firms representing 56 per cent of all IPO funds raised this year, while technology firms only represented 5.8 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/26/dbb07b10-8989-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_image_hires_002604.jpg]To be fair, 82 per cent of the funds raised by Singapore's 13 deals so far this year was accounted for by one single giant tech firm - the NetLink NBN Trust, which is an associate of Singapore Telecommunications. The US$1.695 billion IPO is also the world fourth-largest technology IPO this year.Singapore government has introduced many measures to support start-ups, which is why it has attracted many new companies to set up thereJoseph Tong, Morton Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is trying to play catch up in technology IPOs. It last week ended a consultation for a proposed third board in 2018 that will house two markets - one for the start-ups and the other for mega dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, has opposed to the start-up market as he said these newly set up companies are too risky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung however urged the HKEX to launch the dual class shares market to attract the so-called unicorn technology companies with a market cap over US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many Chinese unicorn technology companies that like to list in Hong Kong. What we need to do is to prepare our markets to meet the needs of these companies," Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Epi Ludvik Nekaj, founder and chief executive of Crowdsourcing Week said he chose to set up his company in Singapore in 2012 because the process was easy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was a very seamless process with functional government agencies giving me guidance at the early stage, proactive </span><span class="s3">Singapore Tourism Board</span><span class="s1"> attracting cutting edge conference like ours and ever-growing ecosystem," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When it comes to fintech start-ups, allowing them to test their financial products in a controlled environment, [that has] put Singapore ahead of Hong Kong. In addition, the entire government of Singapore is mobilised to reinvent its economy, which puts start-ups as one of the main priorities in the government agenda."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said if the HKEX would launch the third board for start-ups, he would consider listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I may consider if this would be a combination of what a second market of crowdfunding may look."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) is exploring ways to regulate the various cryptocurrency trading platforms already operating in the city and thus tighten investor protection, says its outgoing chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His chief sensitivity, however, he told South China Morning Post, is that the SFC is technically restricted by its legal regulatory reach of securities only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not think imposing a total ban on these platforms is necessarily the right approach, and it will not work in today's internet world when trading can cross national boundaries,” said Tong, who is due to hand over the SFC's reins to Tim Lui Tim-leung on October 19.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if we were to ban them, transactions can still be easily conducted via platforms in overseas markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar to traditional stock exchanges, centralised crypto-exchanges are generally run by organisations that oversee their operation, maintenance and security, and which grant users access to the platform by paying a fee. Several are being operated in Hong Kong, but they remain unregulated.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC has issued several warnings in recent months for investors to be wary of trading on them, and to the operators, too, that they must in turn abide strictly to SFC regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in light of increasing trade in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Tong said the watchdog is now anxious to get some more formal cryptocurrency regulations firmly in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have to carefully consider the regulatory approach for these platforms because they are new technology and may not qualify as securities,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They do not fit in the custodian, audit or valuation requirements, for instance, normally expected under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But no other international market currently has a comprehensive regulation framework for these cryptocurrency platforms. We need to see if and how these platforms can be regulated to a standard that is comparable to that of a licensed trading venue, while at the same time ensuring investors interest are being protected.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of The bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency platforms, said she would work closely with the SFC on the proposed regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We hope the guidelines or regulations being considered will keep pace with market developments,” she said in a telephone interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu created an uproar in 2014 after appearing on the </span><span class="s3">China Central Television</span><span class="s1"> programme Voice of Youth, where he encouraged his peers to break free from society's expectations and embrace the internet, while also promising a bonus pool totalling 100 million yuan (US$14.5 million) for employees in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China closes gap with US in hi-tech breakthroughs, KPMG finds[https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/2076348/china-closes-gap-us-hi-tech-breakthroughs-kpmg-finds]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While he was unable to fulfil that pledge, the company not only survived but expanded. However, many other start-ups that secured financing burned through their investments and closed down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mass entrepreneurship and innovation campaign was the brainchild of Premier Li Keqiang, who first promoted it at the </span><span class="s3">World Economic Forum</span><span class="s1">'s 2014 summer gathering in Tianjin. Since then Beijing has continued to support entrepreneurs and start-ups with generous financial incentives in the hope of boosting growth and generating jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his government work report the following year, Li said China needed to develop the twin engines along with an increased supply of “public goods and services, such as education and health care, and encourage non-governmental participation to improve the efficiency of supply”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li delivered his fourth government work report on the opening day of the annual meeting of the National People's Congress on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government also stepped up policy support, not just through subsidies but also by simplifying registration procedures for start-up companies. Entrepreneurs were able to set up small businesses in less than a week with only a few thousand yuan, without needing an office or registered capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With incentives from the central and local governments, more than 3.65 million enterprises were registered across China in 2014. The number rose to 4.43 million in 2015 and 5.52 million last year. Most were small enterprises in the service sector, according to the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC)</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing start-ups move out as hazardous smog smothers capital[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2059320/beijing-start-ups-move-out-hazardous-smog-smothers-capital]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An average of 15,000 new firms were registered each day last year, up from 12,000 a day in 2015, according to mainland media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the central government began to push Li's “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” campaign, local governments at all levels - provincial, city, county, township - jumped on board by subsidising incubators (companies that help start-ups with management training and office space) and innovation parks, and establishing venture capital funds to allow “micro-enterprises” to mushroom under their jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Officials can the claim some credit, at least for those that succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite the impressive figures, some observers are worried about a lack of official or third-party data to show how well the start-ups have performed these past few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is also lack of systematic and effective research and means to assess the national campaign driven by the authorities,” said Tang Jun, a specialist in social policy at the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The economy is still feeling downward pressure. We need more research and observations to see if the mass entrepreneurship and innovation drive is just a temporary phenomenon or can really last for years, promoting jobs and real economic growth.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li's grand plan for entrepreneurs to boost jobs and growth has not panned out for the wider economy. Between 2012 and 2015, China's working population grew very slowly as the registered urban unemployment rate stood unchanged at about 4.1 per cent from 2012 to 2015. In that time, the number of employed people rose from about 767 million to 774.5 million, according to official figures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even Yu's fortunes have been precarious: despite 33 million university students using his app, 4.5 million daily active users and backing from several venture capital firms, the company remained in the red until last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Venture capital fund looks to China start-ups that embrace virtual reality, internet of things[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1960952/venture-capital-fund-looks-china-start-ups-embrace-virtual-reality]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We made zero profit in 2015,” Yu said. “I kept a very low profile that year and in 2016 and I tried every way I could think of to keep the company afloat among its competitors. Only last year did we finally turn a profit.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said things had only got harder for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Compared to the year I started my business, I think it is much harder today for start-ups in spite of the government incentives,” Yu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In 2012, the internet and e-commerce boom was just starting and venture capitalists were hungry for any app. Today there are 10 times as many new innovation or tech start-ups than in 2012. Everyone is thinking of starting a company and looking for investment. But things have changed. Venture capital funds are approaching Chinese projects with greater caution.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is not just competition that is rising - costs such as rent, labour and taxes are squeezing entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, a product manager's wage was 5,000 yuan a month in 2014. Today it is 8,000 yuan,” Yu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite his own success, Yu warned that not everyone was suited to being an entrepreneur, even those with a good eduction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think the mass entrepreneurship and innovation movement started with good intentions, but I really wouldn't encourage a university graduate to rush off and join a start-up,” Yu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many young people join start-ups because they can't find a conventional employer. Actually, these are the people who are just not qualified to be entrepreneurs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The failure rate for start-ups also sounds a warning for those hoping for quick success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forget the glamour, it's a tough life out there: one venture capitalist's hard truths on running start-ups and doing business in China[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/1907076/forget-glamour-its-tough-life-out-there-one-venture]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At least two dozen of my employees quit the company and started up their own businesses in the past couple of years,” said Li Zhiguang, founder of Looksee Group, a Guangzhou-based garment company. “Some rejoined us after their start-ups failed. I feel many young Chinese entrepreneurs are impulsive. Many are not well prepared for start-ups but just follow others into the tide.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The official </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> news agency said the success rate for graduates in first-time start-ups was just 2.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the White Paper 2000 of Human Resources Management on China's Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, released by China HRKEY, a mainland human resources and recruitment website, the average company in China survived for 3.6 years - and just 2.5 years for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - far less than their European and US counterparts that have an average life expectancy of more than 40 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A survey by SAICin late 2015 showed that 30 per cent of the start-ups founded in 2014 across 100 counties had gone out of business. Among those that had survived for the year, about half were able to start paying tax to the government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">News coverage on start-ups at the time showed there were roughly as many companies finding investors as there were going out of business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of February last year, more than 800 mainland Chinese online to offline (O2O) companies that secured “A series” (or first-round) financing in 2014 had used up the money and had closed, according to the government-run Guangzhou Daily.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors are becoming increasingly cautious about internet and tech industries. It is becoming harder this year to attract second- or third-round financing,” said Gu Ying, who set up a mobile car-washing app in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ongoing, nationwide mass entrepreneurship and innovation campaign looked more like an emergency plan to counter the wave of factory closures and unemployment from the economic slowdown, said Liu Kaiming, head of the Institute of Contemporary Observation in Shenzhen, a think tank that focuses on China's social and economic issues.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The campaign had sought to create many enterprises and jobs in the short run, Liu said, but the actual entrepreneurial environment was worsening for start-ups, “especially those in innovation”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While local governments are simplifying registration procedures, taxes and expenses - not just rent and financing but relatively large contributions to workers' social insurance and other surcharges - eat up about half the profits of Chinese enterprises,” Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> report estimated that the total tax rate for Chinese firms averaged 68 per cent, making the mainland's corporate taxes the 12th-highest in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a television interview early this year, Chinese windshield tycoon Cao Dewang said his main reason for investing U$600 million in a US factory for his </span><span class="s3">Fuyao Glass Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> was China's high taxes, which he claimed were 35 per cent higher than for US manufacturers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But government support is likely to see mass entrepreneurship and innovation continue to boom on the mainland in the coming years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just look at Zhubajie.com, also known as zbj.com, one of China's largest online crowdsourcing platforms, which is based in Chongqing and was backed by the local government. It has become a unicorn company, being valued at 11 billion yuan by Chongqing's Bureau of Science and Technology Innovation last year, and plans to go public this year. With investment of 2.6 billion yuan, mostly from government-backed funds, it plans to evolve from being a “Witkey website” (where people can use their knowledge or skills to earn income by solving problems for other people or companies) into a super incubator for entrepreneurs and business start-ups in 35 cities across the country this year, according to its founder, former journalist Zhu Mingyue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In cooperation with local governments, Zhubajie planned to eventually expand to 100 cities across China, becoming the biggest servicing platform for Chinese start-ups and SMEs, Zhu told the Post in an earlier interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Much has been said about lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee's unfortunate collision with a dancer in a unicorn costume over the Lunar New Year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It nearly knocked the New People's Party lawmaker off her feet, sending her flying into a group of rural leaders at a fortune-telling ceremony at the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin. Her detractors hailed the dancer, Tse Lap-yuen, 45, as a "unicorn hero", but Tse said it was an accident - he had stepped out to salute a deity when it happened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some even tried to draw conclusions about Ip's political fate from her run-in with the mythical qilin. It's not surprising - Ip is the only person who has so far indicated that she might run in the chief executive race in 2017. For some, the qilin collision is a bad omen for the 64-year-old. But Ip herself took it as a sign of good fortune and protection because she wasn't hurt in the stumble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If anything, it was a brief source of amusement for a city that is grappling with more than just who will run in 2017; the serious issue of electoral reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is entering a critical stage after the second public consultation on the government's reform package wrapped up on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has reiterated its wish to see the proposal passed so that universal suffrage can be introduced in 2017. The central government is reportedly preparing to reopen dialogue with the pan-democrats - who have vowed to block the framework in the Legislative Council - in a last-ditch effort to win them over.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, meanwhile, must now put together the government's proposal within weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And amid all of this, the candidate guessing game continues - will Lam throw her hat in the ring? What about Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah? His predecessor Antony Leung Kam-chung? Former commerce chief Frederick Ma Si-hang, or perhaps Legco president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing? Housing chief Professor Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, or Chinese University boss Dr Joseph Sung Jao-Yiu? Or maybe Professor Arthur Li Kwok-cheung?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All of these names have come up as possible candidates - and behind all of them of course there are interest groups and political strategies at play.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing, meanwhile, is trying to maintain its tough stance on the electoral reform, which would see two or three candidates put forward for a public vote with the majority support of a committee of 1,200.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government has again made clear during this week's National People's Congress that it will not make any concessions. NPC chairman Zhang Dejiang warned that the opportunity for universal suffrage in 2017 "is not to be missed" - or it will be gone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, Beijing is planning to meet the pan-democratic lawmakers to try to break the deadlock. The Hong Kong government's package needs support from a two-thirds majority in Legco, meaning at least four of the 27 pan-democrats will have to change their minds for it to be passed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the months to come, we can expect to see more names added to the list of possible candidates for 2017, and probably a few names will drop off the list, too.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And what about the pan-democrats? It is understandable that they are sticking to their guns and planning to vote down the government proposal based on Beijing's framework.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But if universal suffrage does happen, let's hope the pan-democrats have their own list of contenders ready.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's vast population of internet users have helped to foster a unique environment where start-ups can enjoy huge success in an unusually short period of time, according to new research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unicorns, or companies that have a market value of US$1 billion or more, are being nurtured in China at a rate that eclipses their US counterparts, according to a joint report by </span><span class="s3">Boston Consulting Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report, released Wednesday in Beijing, examined the development cycles of 175 unicorns from the US and China during the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average unicorn in China took four years to develop from scratch, whereas the average unicorn cycle in the US was seven years, according to Boston Consulting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many cases unicorns in China were thrust into the big leagues at an ultra-short span of time, with 46 per cent reaching the US$1 billion valuation in as little as two years from launch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, only 9 per cent of unicorns were fashioned in the same time frame.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The contrast can be partly explained by differences in the internet user base of the two countries, according to Li Shu, BCG's partner and managing director.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese internet users are more receptive to new applications, but they also cast away applications in a quicker way,” said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Cash is king' mindset is halting Hong Kong's digital revolution, says top Google official[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2110811/googles-hong-kong-sales-and-operations-chief-says-city-falling]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, China's 710 million internet users, roughly equal to the combined internet population in the US and India, provides a deep pool of consumers that can help elevate winning concepts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average age of web users in China is 28, or about 14 years younger than the US average, according to Boston Consulting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It took Amazon 14 years to acquire more than 50 per cent market share in its home market, while Taobao achieved the feat in nine years. Meanwhile, Chinese internet giants such as Alipay, </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, Didi and </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> rose to dominance in their fields in just three to six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Users in first tier cities download an average of 46 apps per year, and those from remote parts of the country could download as many as 38. In the US users download 33 apps per year on average, Boston Consultancy said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, however, only 15 per cent of the apps would be used more than 10 times, while 43 per cent would be tossed aside after a single use, the Boston Consultancy said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese users are fickle,” said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, the internet contributed 6.9 per cent of China's GDP, leaving the country second only to South Korea's 8 per cent. In the US, the internet contributed 5.4 per cent to GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's not a surprise that the world would want to know more about the crocodiles at the Yangtze River,” Francois Candelon, Bostong Consultancy's senior partner and managing director, quoting a phrase first used to describe Alibaba in the 2000s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for outbound strategies, Candelon said he expected Chinese companies to do a better job.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese tech companies would fight over global market with US peers and local organisations,” Candelon said, “At the moment, US companies localise data, but that is not customised in a real sense… We can see Chinese companies are trained to do something different through alliance and local partnership.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Dutch firm headed by “starchitect” Rem Koolhaas this week revealed details of its first Hong Kong project: the Sogo “twin towers” at the site of the former Kai Tak airportfor which Lifestyle International paid HK$7.4 billion[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/2048683/sogo-owner-lifestyle-international-wins-kai-tak-site-hk739b](US$943 million) in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) </span><span class="s1">is best known in Asia for large public commissions, such as the CCTV headquarters in Beijing - nicknamed “Big Pants” for its unusual shape - and the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> building with its floating base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Working inHong Kong's scrunched-up urban landscape has its own challenges, says Chris van Duijn, the OMA partner in charge of the firm's Asian operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two towers will occupy an awkward site that will be surrounded on all sides by other developments. They will have a total gross floor area of more than 100,000 square metres and will feature a Sogo department store as well as other retail, entertainment and food and beverage outlets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Van Duijn says: “We have to think about how tomake the 60- to 80-metre-wide opaque facades interesting. We wanted to use ceramic, but it is very difficult to get the Hong Kong Buildings Department to approvenew materials, so we are using granite and glass instead,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The angular towers will have cut corners at the bottom like the Tencent headquarters in Beijing that OMA is also building, and they willhave publicly accessible balconies and sky gardens when completed in 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The overall feeling will be transparent and open,” he promises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, an architect's best intentions aren't always realised once a building's owners move in. That has happened at the CCTV building, where OMA's designated public spaces are no longer open to the public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Shanghai, Van Duijn's team is working on a master plan for the redevelopment of an industrial cluster called the Columbia Circle. OMA is focusing on access and the preservation of historic colonial monuments and industrial buildings. But Van Duijn has to accept that, since it is not involved in the project's construction, there is no guarantee its plan will be followed to the letter by developer </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1">, the client.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai project is an example of the sort of short-term, nimble contracts OMA has increasingly taken on in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The master plan took us just 12 weeks to do compared with the 12 years we spent onFondazione Prada[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-entertainment/article/1806923/milans-fondazione-prada-art-serious-style] [a former gin distillery in Milan renovated to serve as the charity's headquarters]. Instead of spending a lot of time finessing one proposal, we sometimes give clients a number of draft options to choose from. It is how it works in China and it was high time we woke up to it,” Van Duijn says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">OMA is still going for statement projects, such as the Tencent headquarters and Chengdu's Unicorn City - a future district in the western Chinese city designed to generate“unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion). This week, OMA's futuristic proposal was named one of the winners of a design competition for Unicorn City. But the number of new mega projects in China is falling, Van Duijn says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For this reason, international firms need to take on more “quick and dirty” projects that may only involve a paper plan rather than an entire building. There has seen a sharp spike in the number of such projects for OMA's Asia team, which now has around 35 people in its Hong Kong office compared to around 80 a few years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Van Duijn says: “OMA's approach to Asia has changed over the years. Our first Asia projects were in Japan and South Korea during the late 1980s. They were all donefrom our head office in Rotterdam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the late 1990s, we focused on the US, but after the 9/11 attacks all our work got cancelled and we had to refocus. That's when we decided to go east and bid for the CCTV project in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We got other projects and opened an office in the city. But after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the market collapsed for international architects because the Chinese began to do it themselves. So we moved to Hong Kong. And in the last two years, we have restructured our office and our focus.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has worked since 2007 on the Prada project at the sprawling, 19,000 square metre, early 20th century industrial complex for the cultural institution set up by fashion designer Miuccia Prada and her husband,Patrizio Bertelli, in 1993. Last month, the final element was put in place: a 60-metre-high tower called the Torre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One reason I came to Asia is that projects in Europe often take12-17 years to build. That's a lot of time. And most of the time is notspent on architecture and quality, but on risk registers and process-related work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With the Shanghai project, it is very chaotic and dynamic. I like the positive energy and not looking at checking boxes all the time,” Van Duijn says.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Less than 20 minutes - or 18.2 minutes to be precise - is how long Luckin Coffee says an average consumer in major Chinese cities has to wait after placing an order through their phone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the delivery time is not fast enough, at least for Jenny Qian Zhiya, chief executive of the cafe start-up, who is counting on a growing taste for coffee among the mostly tea-drinkers in the world's most populous nation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having announced a US$200 million funding round this week, the cafe chain operator - which claims a unicorn-status valuation of US$1 billion - is building up its war chest to take on the country's leading player Starbucks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin's investors include Singapore's sovereign fund GIC, Centurium Capital, a private equity fund founded by the former China head of Warburg Pincus, </span><span class="s3">Legend Capital</span><span class="s1"> and Joy Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although the delivery time is already within half an hour, we will cut it even shorter,” Qian said on Thursday. “The best experience should be that the coffee is still icy in summer when it reaches customers, while still hot enough to warm hands in winter.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the way to achieving that goal, the Xiamen-based start-up has already spent 1 billion yuan (US$150 million) in the six months since its soft launch, Qian said. About 600 physical stores have mushroomed in 13 Chinese cities since the start of the year, and five million cups were sold in the first four months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, just under half are effectively “takeaway kitchens”, where coffee is prepared exclusively to fill delivery orders from customers, fitting into the "new retail" strategies becoming increasingly popular among e-commerce and traditional retailers in China that combine online and offline operations, according to the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coffee start-up Luckin is China's latest unicorn after funding round[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2150529/coffee-start-luckin-chinas-latest-unicorn-after-first-funding-round]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Previously, you had to look for coffee, but now coffee comes to you,” she said in a small group media interview in Beijing, adding that Luckin wants to cater to customers “at any moment”, whether they are at work, on a university campus or even at a service station while filling up their car.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The standard price for a large latte is 24 yuan, according to Luckin's app, about 20 per cent cheaper than a comparable order at </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1">. The Chinese company's special offers include “buy two, get one free” and “buy five, get five free”. A free drink is offered for any order that does not arrive within half an hour, or is spilt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With the latest funding round and other financing, we now have a cash reserve of 2 billion yuan,” Qian said. “The company is in no rush to make a profit.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the sentiment sounds familiar, it is because Luckin's strategy is not unique in China, where new on-demand services typically offer heavy subsidies at first in order to gain a critical mass of users. Luckin is among the raft of start-ups that are capitalising on the rise of on-demand services in China. The country is home to 772 million internet users and has 11 times more mobile payment users than the US, according to the China Internet Report published this week by the South China Morning Post, Abacus and 500 Startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before starting Luckin, Qian was chief operating officer of China's car rental giant CAR Inc and its ride-hailing affiliate UCAR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The CEO is adamant that a successful internet strategy is not simply offering subsidised on-demand services, rather it is one that is “customer-centric”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian said the company will continue to rely on technologies such as optimisation of delivery routes and IT systems and use of internet-connected coffee machines for real-time monitoring to improve efficiency and reduce costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seen as an up-and-coming challenger to </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> in China, Luckin has filed a law suit against its Seattle-based rival for alleged monopolistic practices, including signing exclusive rental contracts that block property owners from leasing to another coffee brand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian confirmed that a Chinese court has accepted the case and it is under proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> is currently the country's dominant coffee provider, with a market share of about 58.6 per cent, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Euromonitor International</span><span class="s1">. It plans to build about 3,000 new stores in mainland China by 2022, which would roughly double its current number of 3,300, according to a company announcement in May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Luckin will be a strong rival to </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1">,” said Qian. “It fits our idea to make coffee affordable.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin will soon face more competition from an overseas brand with </span><span class="s3">Tim Hortons</span><span class="s1">, a Canadian coffee maker, planning to open 1,500 shops in China over the next 10 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a vast market that is far from being well catered for,” said Qian. “People think of drinking coffee as a luxury as most ‘professional' brands price it at over 30 yuan a cup, and there are not many cafes either. The long queues and high cost has restricted consumption desire as well as frequency.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan, Hong Kong's first billion-dollar “unicorn” start-up, said it has raised US$250 million in the first phase of its new round of funding, led by InnoVision Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other investors include Alibaba's logistics arm Cainiao, Russia-China Investment Fund, Hongrun Capital, Qianhai Fund of Funds, and 58 Daojia Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since its establishment in 2013, GoGoVan has received funding from investors globally, including Centurion Private Equity, </span><span class="s3">Renren</span><span class="s1"> , MFund, New Horizon Capital, Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, </span><span class="s3">Singapore Press Holdings</span><span class="s1"> , and </span><span class="s3">Hotung Investment Holdings</span><span class="s1"> , the company said in a statement on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fundraising follows GoGoVan's merger last August with 58 Suyun, the largest intra-city logistics platform in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since the merger, our business has been advancing rapidly. With the number of powerful investors on board in this round of funding, it shows that the market approves of our strategy,” said Steven Lam Hoi-yuen, chief executive officer and co-founder of GoGoVan. “We strive to simplify logistics and delivery services.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reuters cited Lam last year saying he was considering to raise up to US$200 million selling shares to strategic investors to help fund expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of GoGoVan's ambitions was to eventually list in Hong Kong, according to Lam in an interview with the Post last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proceeds from the latest US$250 million fund raising will be used to expand service offerings and grow new markets. GoGoVan will offer door-to-door service for the small item delivery segment in the next few months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Co-founded with Nick Tang Kuen-wai and Reeve Kwan Chun-ma with just HK$20,000 (US$2,548), GoGoVan now enjoys the honour of being Hong Kong's first “unicorn” start-up, with an estimated valuation of over US$1 billion after the merger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">58 Home, which owns a majority stake in the merged entity, is backed by Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, and private equity investors </span><span class="s3">KKR &amp; Co LP</span><span class="s1"> and New Horizon Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has more than eight million users for large businesses. It operates in a similar manner to ride-hailing companies such as </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> , providing on-demand van hailing services which connects customers with van drivers through an app. One of its main competitors in Hong Kong is Lalamove.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's e-commerce market has benefited logistics companies by spurring demand for transport services to help deliver products to customers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, intense competition has driven some e-commerce companies to develop logistics facilities and capabilities to control costs and quality through their own networks rather than using third-party logistics providers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's logistics market surpassed the US in 2015 as the world's largest, estimated at US$1.6 trillion according to iResearch. The sector is expected to grow at a compounded 2.1 per cent per year from through 2021, iResearch said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China's booming technology sector women play a bigger role than men - more than 55 per cent of tech start-ups are founded by women, according to the country's State Council, compared to 22 per cent in the US. Here is a look at some of the women leaders in China's technology industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jean Liu, 40, president of </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, China's dominant ride sharing firm</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Within two years of joining Didi in 2014, Liu and Didi CEO Cheng Wei had succeeded in pushing the global ride-hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> out of China's market. Now Didi is one of the world's most valuable private start-ups worth US$56 billion, processing more than 25 bookings a day. Liu, daughter of Lenovo founder Liu Chuanzhi, was born in 1978 in Beijing. After her Bachelor's in Computer Science from </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1"> she continued further study at Harvard in the US. Before joining Didi Liu worked at Goldman Sachs Asia for more than a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peng Lei, 46, chairwoman of Ant Financial, parent of mobile payment app Alipay</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the earliest 10 co-founders of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> where she started in human resources, Peng became CEO of Alipay in 2010. It has since grown into China's biggest online payment service with more than 520 million users. Peng resigned as Ant Financial CEO in 2016, but stills serves as chairwoman of the US$70 billion unicorn. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kathy Xu Xin, 50, founder and managing partner at Capital Today</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 Xu founded Capital Today, where she has invested in several multibillion-dollar companies including e-commerce giant JD and </span><span class="s3">tudou.com</span><span class="s1">, the video arm of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">. Capital Today currently manages a US$680 million fund. As early as 1995, Xu invested US$5 million in NetEase, which is now China's second-largest gaming company. She graduated from </span><span class="s3">Nanjing University</span><span class="s1"> in 1988.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anna Fang, 36, CEO of ZhenFund, a Beijing-based venture capital firm</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fang manages a US$950 million fund, with her portfolio including the e-commerce platform Red and facial recognition start-up Yitu Technology. Before ZhenFund, she worked at </span><span class="s3">GE</span><span class="s1"> China, responsible for </span><span class="s3">GE</span><span class="s1">'s mergers and acquisitions and business development. Fang started out as a JPMorgan analyst in New York City. Fang received her Bachelor's degree from </span><span class="s3">Columbia University</span><span class="s1">, and a Master's in Business Administration from </span><span class="s3">Stanford University</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cindy Mi Wenjuan, 35, founder and CEO of VIPKID, a Beijing-based online education unicorn</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A high school dropout, Mi founded the online learning company in 2013. The company connects North American instructors to more than 200,000 Chinese students aged 4-12, providing them with one-on-one online English learning courses that last for 25 minutes. VIPKID is currently valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Zhen, senior vice-president of Bytedance, parent of China's most popular news aggregator Toutiao</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu joined Bytedance in her current position two years ago. The company owns the Chinese news app Toutiao, which recommends content to users based on artificial intelligence algorithms, and last November bought social video app Musical.ly, giving it millions of users in the US. Liu is the niece of Lenovo founder Liu Chuanzhi, and Jean Liu's cousin. Before Bytedance, she was head of strategy at Uber China. Liu received a law degree from the </span><span class="s3">University of California, Berkeley</span><span class="s1">, and practised law for nine years in the US advising tech firms in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jane Sun Jie, CEO of Ctrip.com, China's biggest online travel service company</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It looks like China is increasingly embracing its communist collective roots, especially within the technology industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Years of costly competition between </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> and its main local rival </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> in China have made millions of Chinese comfortable about riding in each other's cars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And more than 30 bike-sharing start-ups have sprouted up in the country, dismissing urban dwellers' ideas of buying their own bikes (or cars, for that matter), by carpeting the streets with millions of easily accessible two-wheelers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now, a lot more entrepreneurs are jumping on the sharing bandwagon with an increasingly enriched list of offerings, from smartphone power banks and umbrellas, to basketballs and even cigarette lighters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All can be conveniently borrowed on street corners, in shopping malls and subway stations... often with little more than the simple swipe of a smartphone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As more entrepreneurs and venture capitalists enter the battlefield, setting up new businesses using the same, sharing recipe, scepticism already now mounting on whether the country is “over sharing” even among those at the very heart of this new collective revolution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the China's State Information Office, 600 million Chinese have tried or signed up to use something or working to provide a service within the sharing economy last year, creating a market worth 3.45 trillion yuan (US$ 507 billion) in 2016, up 103 per cent on 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Research firm CB Insights, claims, incidentally, that three of out of the world's five most-valuable private companies are all in the sharing economy: Uber ranks first with a valuation of US$68 billion, followed by </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> at US$50 billion and global home swapping/sharing </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, worth USS$29.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Early-stage investment is all about keeping a close eye on the next big thing. But it feels like more and more people are betting on this (sharing economy) with their eyes closed,” said Tony Liang Weihong, a partner at </span><span class="s3">Panda Capital</span><span class="s1">, an investor in China's bike-sharing major Mobike</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liang is keen to point out that many of the businesses being created under this new sharing economic model do have value - but their longer-term success, effectively comes down to two simple questions: is there a need from people for whatever you provide, and is sharing really the best solution?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For entrepreneurs like Xu Min, who set up China's first ever basketball-sharing company in March, the answers to both are “yes and yes”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 31-year-old from Jiaxing of East China's Zhejiang province spotted what he hopes will be a billion dollar idea after one of his friends complaining about the inconvenience of carrying a basketball round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's bike-sharing battle ratchets up a notch as Didi Chuxing enters the fray[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2091191/chinas-bike-sharing-battle-ratchets-notch-didi-chuxing-enters-fray]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So many have been hooked by the convenience of bike-sharing, I thought why not let people get access to basketballs in the same way?” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He's set up a company called “Zhulegeqiu”, which roughly translates as “Rent a Ball” and started introducing specially designed basketball lockers at outdoor public basketball courts across the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Each of the lockers can hold six balls, and by scanning a quick respond code on the locker, users can quickly unlock it and borrow the ball for 3 yuan (45 US cents) per hour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is an entirely self-serve process. The whole process or borrowing, returning and paying (including the refundable deposit of 49 yuan (US$7.20), is made by smartphone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu only just secured his first found of funding of more than 10 million yuan in May, from the Shanghai-based Modern Capital, and is about to close a new round by the end of June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen Zhu Xiaohu, the managing partner at GSR Ventures Management, thinks the sharing craze is being fuelled by an stark shift in the country's approach to lending to enterpreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There wasn't much money in the [start-up] market. But now there's a surplus,” said Zhu, a veteran venture capitalist who was listed in </span><span class="s3">Forbes</span><span class="s1"> magazine's Midas List in 2016 for his successful track record in discovering tomorrow's “unicorns” - private companies worth more than US$1 billion or more.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To underline his point of a land flush with VC capital, Zhu said that </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, China's second largest e-commerce, raised a total of US$1.2 billion before its Nasdaq-listing in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And now </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, China's equivalent of Uber, is able to raise US$15 billion without even releasing an IPO timetable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Driven by the Chinese government's ambition to transform the country to an innovation-driven economy, and dwindling investment returns elsewhere, the technology sector has become the current apple of every investors' eye.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But decisions, fear Liang of </span><span class="s3">Panda Capital</span><span class="s1">, are being made far too often on herd mentality, rather than business sense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors are simply afraid about missing out on big opportunities,” he adds.“But certainly ‘sharing economy' are the great buzz words in China right now - everyone wants to get in on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bike-sharing industry landed its first unicorn earlier this year, and companies that allow phone users to share power banks, have raised at least $150 million in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Can China's next unicorn be borne out of humble power banks?[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2093813/can-chinas-next-unicorn-be-borne-out-humble-power-banks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jeffrey Towson, an investment professor at China's elite </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1">, views the booming industry slightly differently, calling it a new wave of “digital disruptors” in access and convenience: a living example, he adds, of “making it easy and making it now” for consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is only possible in China,” he added, “because of the arrival of smartphones, mobile payments, and a very dynamic mobile app ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wilson Chow, the TMT leader of PwC in China and Hong Kong, agrees completely with Towson, but adds the nation's tech-led stampede for sharing, isn't really about saving money, it's more to do with convenience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For young people in China, sharing is not a matter of affordability. They simply don't want to carry an umbrella around nor spend money on things that they can use once or twice a month,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest figures show that 50 times as many mobile-based payments were made in China last year than in the US, meaning that even the inconvenience of carrying a wallet is fast becoming a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But without doubt, the most crowded and visible form of sharing is being on two wheels, with more than 30 start-ups launching bike-sharing apps already.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another dozen players appear to be fighting it out in the smartphone power bank sharing market, and there are six more dedicated solely to umbrellas sharing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And they have nearly all emerged within the past ten months, according to a Beijing-based data firm IT Juzi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GSR Ventures' Zhu - who has invested in </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, Beijing-based bike-sharing major Ofo, and most recently in the smartphone power bank sharing firm Xiaodian - warns, however, that already a lot of VC cash has been wasted, simply because too much is being invested in too many firms with the same idea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This crowded war zone has made competition brutal. Even if you make a good start, it doesn't ensure that you'll have a happy ending,” added Liang of </span><span class="s3">Panda Capital</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Basketball entrepreneur Xu, meanwhile, has managed to register his own easy-to-copy business as his own intellectual property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he still doesn't feel that's going to be enough to safeguard his business. Just prior to speaking with South China Morning Post, he had heard of another firm company preparing to offer the same kind of service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He allowed just 10 minutes of his precious time for this interview, adding: “To enlarge our first mover advantage... I can't waste another second on things that are not about market expansion or fundraising.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese people's extensive and long hours of smartphone usage has propelled the humble power banks to become the latest flavour of the day in China's start-up scene, attracting funding from prominent investors, including internet giant Tencent Holdings[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=700&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investors are in it for a simple reason: To cash in on the low battery anxiety that plagues China's more than 1 billion smartphone users by allowing them to rent portable power banks as and when they need.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dozen of players have jumped onto the power bank rental bandwagon in the past several weeks, driven by the influx of venture capital. The rental outlets have started to flood major cities in China with all kinds of designated power bank distribution machines, which can be as big as a vending machine or as small as a mini fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through apps, users can find the nearest available machines, which are usually located at cinemas, shopping malls and restaurants, and rent a power bank out via scanning quick respond codes. The price is often set at 1 yuan per hour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's bike-sharing battle ratchets up a notch as Didi Chuxing enters the fray[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2091191/chinas-bike-sharing-battle-ratchets-notch-didi-chuxing-enters-fray]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Driven by the rapid development of mobile payment and the frequent use of smartphones in China, power bank rental is set to push the entire industry of internet of things moving forward,” said Tang Yongbo, founder of the Tencent-backed Xiaodian, which is arguably the market leader of power bank rental for raising a total of 450 million yuan, by far the biggest amount in the industry so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Power banks are not new in China and are easily affordable for many as they can cost less than 100 yuan. But the increasing use of smartphone in almost every part of people's daily life, from hailing cars, shopping online, to paying for purchases at convenient stores, or the occasional urgent need for power have made power bank rental a seemingly lucrative business, despite opposing voices in the market.Driven by the rapid development of mobile payment and the frequent use of smartphones in China, power bank rental is set to push the entire industry of internet of things moving forwardTang Yongbo, Xiaodian</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Ou, founder of the Chinese e-commerce site Jumei, is a firm believer of the potential multi-billion yuan power bank rental market in China. He invested 300 million yuan in Ankerbox, a Shenzhen-based power bank rental firm last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a strong demand for renting power banks for short time use - when dining at a restaurant or drinking at a bar. It is very convenient, there's no need to carry your own power banks around,” Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the absence of a mature business model, an estimated 1.2 billion yuan from 35 venture capital firms have already poured into the power bank rental business in the past 40 days, according to mainland media.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hype is similar to the one surrounding China's red-hot app-enabled bike-rental industry, in which generous venture capitals have crowned one unicorn, which refers to tech startups worth US$1 billion or more, and fueled the expansion of 30 bike-rental start-ups, which have been carpeting China's sidewalks with millions of bikes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Critics of power bank rental questions the rationale for such a business, and see it as a short-term fad. One of the biggest opposition came from Wang Sicong, son of </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda</span><span class="s1">'s Wang Jianlin, China's richest man.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a recent </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> post, Wang Sicong pledged that he would eat excretion if the power bank rental business becomes a feasible business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On average, the Chinese spend nearly 3 hours a day on their smartphones with Tencent's social networking tools </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> and QQ, Baidu's online video app </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba's online shopping service Taobao accounting for most of the usage time, according to iResearch.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's goal of becoming a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) is nowhere more manifested than in how facial recognition technology has become a part of daily life in the world's second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Facial recognition systems, which are biometric computer applications that automatically identify an individual from a database of digital images, are now being used extensively in areas such as public security, financial services, transport and retail across the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global facial recognition market is forecast to be worth US$6.5 billion by 2021, up from US$2.3 billion in 2016, according to the latest estimates from research company Technavio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of Chinese companies have already staked a claim into this growing market, where their products and services are used by organisations in both the public and commercial sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are five start-ups that are spurring further innovations in facial recognition systems:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">1. DeepGlint</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: He Bofei, Zhao Yong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: Series A</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, ZhenFund, Microsoft Accelerator Beijing and Ceyuan Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2013, DeepGlint is an AI company based in Beijing that specialises in the field of computer vision, which is focused on the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or sequence of images.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its proprietary DeepGlint technology is used in the detection, tracking and recognition of people and vehicles. Clients include banks, museums and public security agencies. The company is exploring the application of its technology in driverless vehicles as well as robotic and smart medical systems.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Megvii, which is also known as Face++, was established in 2011 by three </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1"> graduates. Its Face++ facial recognition software platform is recognised as the world's largest, which is used by more than 300,000 developers in 150 countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That technology platform is behind many popular applications implemented in China, including those from payments giant Alipay, mobile photo editing app provider Meitu, ride-hailing service </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, computer maker </span><span class="s3">Lenovo Group</span><span class="s1">, smartphone supplier Xiaomi, </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Citic Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Megvii's technology is also used by the Ministry of Public Security, which oversees a facial scan database of more than 1.3 billion people in China. Its an innovation that has helped China's police force arrest more than 4,000 people since 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">3.SenseTime Group</span></p>

The company became the city's first hi-tech unicorn - a start-up valued at US$1 billion or more - after completing its Series B funding round in July last year. It is currently valued at more than US$2 billion after Alibaba, which owns theSouth China Morning Post, made a US$227 million investment in November last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SenseTime has more than 400 customers and strategic partners, including </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, Meitu, graphics processor maker </span><span class="s3">Nvidia</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1">, and mainland smartphone giants </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2012, Shanghai-based Yitu has gained wide recognition for its Dragonfly Eye System, a facial scan platform that can identify a person from a database of at least two billion people in a matter of seconds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company opened last month its first international office in Singapore, where it plans to hire more than 50 researchers. It recently formed a strategic cooperation with local governments and various organisations in Britain in the fields of public security, finance and health care.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> paid an estimated US$100 million to take over EyeVerify months after the Kansas City, Missouri-based company landed a deal to integrate its Eyeprint ID into Alipay's payments authentication system. That ID technology turns a selfie of a user's eye into a biometric security key.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August last year, EyeVerify changed its name to Zoloz to reflect the company's mobile-centric mission to fuse biometrics with authentication technology into a comprehensive platform, enabling people to seamlessly connect across devices and activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zoloz, now a subsidiary of </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, claims to have more than 200 million users worldwide.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A start-up from the Philippines is looking to blaze a trail in the emerging sector of property technology, or proptech, by supplying limited-edition, luxury prefabricated homes to a global market primed for new modular dwelling options.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Revolution Precrafted recently became the Philippines' first “unicorn”, a start-up valued at more than US$1 billion, amid efforts to bring its luxury prefabricated houses - composed of modular parts that can be snapped together on-site like Lego bricks - into 25 countries by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite its high valuation, the company is yet to make its first shipment of prefabricated homes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to be the </span><span class="s3">Ikea</span><span class="s1"> of homes,” said Jose Roberto Antonio, the founder and chief executive of Revolution Precrafted, in an interview. “We want to be able to create homes that can be built in 60 to 90 days, as opposed to two years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Manila-based company, which expects to soon start talks with property developers in China, will deliver its first 100 modular home units this December in its home market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Answer to Hong Kong housing crisis lies in prefabricated container homes[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2152220/answer-hong-kong-housing-crisis-lies-prefabricated]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its expansion initiative has come at a time when residential property prices are surging across Asia's major economies, and prefabricated homes are increasingly viewed by many experts as cheaper and faster-to-build alternatives to traditional housing units.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A housing crisis in Hong Kong, for example, has led the city's government to embark on its first social housing project using prefabricated container homes, with the first batch of units expected to be ready for families to move in around September next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With an ageing construction labour force, and a five-year wait to get into low-rent public housing, the need to build quickly and cheaply has become paramount in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such modular buildings have already become commonplace in larger markets, such as mainland China and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there are many companies around the world that specialise in modular homes, Antonio said Revolution Precrafted was the first one to focus on luxury prefabricated homes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm sells direct to property developers that establish the sites for prefabricated homes. Its first 100 units will be installed this December in Batulao Artscapes, a project described as a “liveable art park” under the Antonio family-owned </span><span class="s3">Century Properties</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Antonio has enlisted the help of more than 80 prominent architects, artists and designers to create an exclusive range of prefabricated homes. These include experts from such firms as </span><span class="s3">Zaha Hadid Architects</span><span class="s1">, Jean Nouvel Design, </span><span class="s3">Ron Arad</span><span class="s1"> Architects and Kravitz Design.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average price of homes from Revolution Precrafted costs around US$120,000. A 23-square metre home, however, starts for about US$10,000, which is estimated to be 72 times less than what a similarly sized flat would cost in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How proptech is changing Hong Kong's property industry[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145546/how-proptech-changing-hong-kongs-property-industry]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Antonio, 41, hoped to get costs down over time to make his firm's prefabricated homes more affordable, especially in other countries in Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I want to sell homes to the mid-market and later down the road, to the affordable market,” he said. The goal, he added, was to help more people be able to afford their dream homes even if they are not wealthy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asa Bruno, a director at </span><span class="s3">Ron Arad</span><span class="s1"> Architects, said the firm has already designed for Revolution Precrafted what it calls an “Armadillo Tea Canopy” - an independent shelter made of timber that is shaped like the leathery armour-shelled mammal - for both indoor and outdoor use.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For us, it was very important to make [the tea canopy] affordable,” Bruno said. “So while it's luxurious, it's not completely beyond the means of most people.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The asset-light model of Revolution Precrafted, in which it strikes deals with developers and works with factories to produce the homes, has helped make the firm profitable, according to Antonio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which counts 500 Startups and K2 Global as investors, currently has construction projects in 22 countries, including Myanmar, Japan, Puerto Rico, the United Arab Emirates and Spain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is among a growing number of proptech start-ups in the Asia-Pacific, which have raised funding of about US$4.8 billion of the US$7.8 billion total invested globally from 2013 to June 2017, according to a report published in February this year by real estate consultancy JLL and regional start-up platform Tech in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What Revolution Precrafted is doing is structural disruption, and most of all, they make huge revenues from the get-go,” said Khailee Ng, a 500 Startups partner who manages the venture capital firm's Southeast Asian fund.We want to be able to create homes that can be built in 60 to 90 daysJose Roberto Antonio, chief executive of Revolution Precrafted</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We always look for large industries which have little or no innovation. The property sales and construction value chain is one of the biggest there is, and has essentially been the same for too long.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total value of investible global commercial real estate is forecast to reach US$65 trillion by 2020, with the Asia-Pacific accounting for more than 30 per cent of that amount, according to JLL.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Antonio said the market for his company's luxury prefabricated homes would be places like Malaysia or China, where it was looking for a trusted developer as a partner and where there is plenty of land for such development. The company would not be able to “provide value” in densely populated markets, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Every beauty brand knows the key to runaway success - the kind that involves waiting lists, and hype a marketer can only dream about - is for your product to hit the big time on </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The beauty business has its fair share of holy-grail items that predate social media, from Guerlain's tried-and-true Meteorites powder to Shu Uemura's cult-favourite Cleansing Oil, but today entire brands are predicated on </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> followings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take Huda Beauty, the make-up line launched by make-up artist turned influencer Huda Kattan, who launched the brand three years after creating a blog for tutorials in 2010. The brand debuted last month on the Hong Kong website of beauty retailer Sephora, which reported that it came in second in the top 10 brands list within the first week of launching.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Huda Beauty sold out of a couple of popular shades of the Obsessions Eyeshadow Palettes and Liquid Matte Lipsticks, which is not surprising thanks to its virality and high social engagement on </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">,” says Wendy Koh, a Sephora Asia e-commerce executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, Kylie Jenner made headlines when Forbes estimated her three-year-old company Kylie Cosmetics, of which she is sole owner, could be valued at US$1 billion by next year; if so, she would oust Mark Zuckerberg as the youngest self-made billionaire. Her </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> account may have substantially more followers than her company, at 114 million followers, but the cosmetics line still commands over 17 million followers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As marketers in Hong Kong know, social-media influence may work better in some niches than in others. “One particularity that remains in Hong Kong is forums. After </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">, they are the most active platform through which people ask for advice and find resellers, discounts and good deals,” says Koh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Does </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> provide the same marketing push in the luxury sphere? “Social media, especially </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">, definitely acts as a catalyst to boost brand awareness,” says Newby Hands, global beauty director for online fashion retailer Net-a-Porter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As an industry built on the idea of change, it's understandable that we are all fascinated by the shift ignited by influencers and social media. That said … for the customer it is always fundamentally about the product. So even if the interest is there, if the product isn't [performing], it won't translate into commercial success.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here, we introduce eight products that got their start on social media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">1. Huda Beauty</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of Dubai-based beauty blogger-turned-entrepreneur Huda Kattan's insanely popular brand, the Desert Dusk Eyeshadow Palette is among its most viral hits. The product, initially released last year, features 18 colours in a range of warm and rosy tones inspired by the Arabian Desert, which come in four textures (matt, pearl, metallic and glitter).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2. Summer Fridays Jetlag Mask</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This hydrating mask is definitely a beneficiary of the </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> effect. Billed as a no-rinse hydrating mask that takes effect after 10 minutes on the skin, it's filled with vitamin C to brighten and suck in moisture, with chestnut extract to exfoliate, green tea to reduce inflammation and niacinamide to shrink pores, even out skin tone and reduce fine lines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">3. Pat McGrath MatteTrance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The acclaimed make-up artist consulted on cosmetics lines for </span><span class="s3">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span><span class="s1"> and Gucci before launching her own tightly edited product line.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It started with editorial one-offs: kits to create glitter lips, molten gold liquid eye shadow, or the legendary Skin Fetish highlighter, which garnered enough traffic that it crashed her website within a minute of its launch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But she hit the jackpot last year with a more down-to-earth permanent collection featuring the same high-quality formulas in more everyday shades such as Omi, a bestseller on Net-a-Porter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">4. Farsali Unicorn Essence</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anyone watching </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> make-up time-lapse videos will have seen this product, a shimmery pink solution that is dispensed in a dropper. You'll recognise not only the formula, but the proper influencer-endorsed method of application: a drop each applied under the eyes to resemble unicorn tears (the original name of the product before a trademark issue arose).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This water-based formula isn't just a serum - it's also a make-up or eye shadow primer, and can be used before highlighter to intensify the glow. It's filled with superfruit extracts that fight signs of ageing and fill the skin with antioxidants. Get it at Sephora Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">5. Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The K-beauty retailer made it big consulting for Korean skincare brands and helping repackage products for sale in Western markets before hitting the jackpot with its own succinct range that thus far boasts only four products, including two variations of a radiance-boosting watermelon sleeping mask. Key ingredients include watermelon extract and hyaluronic acid that clear blockages for deeper hydration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">6. Glossier Boy Brow</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The brainchild of Emily Weiss, founder of beauty blog Into the Gloss, Glossier became a brand to be reckoned with not long after its launch in 2010, and is consistently loved by editors and buyers alike. A bestseller among bestsellers, Boy Brow is a clear or tinted grooming pomade that utilises a mascara-style wand that will hold your brows in place without clumping, residue or that hardened texture left behind by gel formulas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">7. Nurse Jamie UpLift Massaging Beauty Roller</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This beauty tool has been popular with celebrities such as Jessica Alba and Emily Ratajkowski since its launch; combine that with a rather down-to-earth price point (US$69) with no hidden extras, and you have a social-media sensation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It can be used on the face and body in tandem with any cream you already have; just roll along the face, as shown in any of the many instructional videos available online, and the massaging stones, made from tourmaline quartz, will aid in lymphatic drainage to eliminate puffiness, as well as stimulate collagen production to provide a lifting effect over the long term. It's available in Hong Kong via Net-a-Porter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">8. Tatcha The Silk Canvas Filter Finish Protective Primer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You cannot win at </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1"> without a flawless (and filtered) face, so it's no surprise that this primer by Tatcha became a hit with the beauty crowd from the moment it was launched, thanks to its ability to blur pores and offer a soft-focus finish without shine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What's more, this primer acts as a protective barrier between your skin and external aggressors such as pollution or your make-up, preventing breakouts and wrinkles.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A combination of talent, money and government support makes Zhongguancun the closest equivalent in China to Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the entrance to the Garage Café in Beijing's Zhongguancun, a slogan reads "you are just one garage away from entrepreneurship, one coffee away from innovation”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With its name inspired by Steve Jobs' Apple Garage, the cafe located on the 220-metre-long Zhongguancun Inno Way, a government-backed incubation zone for start-ups, is not designed for everyday coffee chat but more as a place to help ideas meet capital with the aim of finding the next big thing in technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the good old days, techies could land investment with nothing but ideas. Now investors are getting picky as we enter a capital winter. But Zhongguancun is still the place to be for anyone who wants to set up their own tech business in China,” said Zhang Xiyang, manager of Garage Café.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded 30 years ago with a mission to "learn from Silicon Valley and replicate Silicon Valley”, Zhongguancun is at the forefront of Beijing's drive to turn the country from ‘workshop of the world' into a global technology powerhouse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is home to nearly 9,000 hi-tech firms, including some of China's biggest internet firms, such as Nasdaq-listed Baidu[https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-gaming/article/2157795/baidu-follows-tencents-lead-building-super-app-ecosystem-new] and </span><span class="s3">Sina Corp</span><span class="s1">. Nearly half of China's 70 unicorns - start-ups with a valuation of more than US$1 billion each - are located in the area. As many as 80 tech start-ups are born there every day. Here is what you need to know about the area.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where to find Zhongguancun?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Located in northwestern Beijing's Haidian district, Zhongguancun was initially known as a street for consumer electronics sales in 1978 when China's reform and liberalisation drive kicked off. The ‘cun' at the end of Zhongguancun literally means "village” in Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In battle for global tech talent, Beijing offers foreign researchers the perk of bringing their own helpers[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2135371/battle-global-tech-talent-beijing-offers-foreign-researchers-perk-bringing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After gaining the blessing of </span><span class="s3">China's State Council</span><span class="s1"> in 1988, Zhongguancun became the country's first hi-tech industry pilot zone. Since then, the areas has become the launch pad for some of China's most successful entrepreneurial firms with the backing of Beijing to make it "a national innovation centre with global influence”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the years, Zhongguancun has expanded geographically to become a 488-square-kilometre zone. Its operations and innovation parks have expanded far beyond Haidian district, scattering all over the Chinese capital. To some extent, Zhongguancun is no longer just a physical point on a map and is more of a calling card for China's rising hi-tech prowess.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How to build Zhongguancun?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Close to some of China's most prestigious universities and research institutes, Zhongguancun enjoys great advantages in access to talent. The Haidian park of Zhongguancun is home to more than 40 universities, including the world-class Peking and Tsinghua Universities, as well as more than 200 research institutes and national-level laboratories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government also lends a hand. Preferential policies, including tax breaks and funding, offered in Zhongguancun by local and central government, helps to make the place a magnet for tech talent and companies. To attract global talent, Beijing's municipal authorities earlier this year announced plans to offer permanent residence for senior hires and allow them to bring their domestic helpers - if needed - with them to China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Substantial capital funding for qualified business ideas is also critical for Zhongguancun's entrepreneurial community. Beijing ranked as the top location for tech-related investments in China in the first half of 2017 by both deal volume and deal value, according to a report by PwC earlier this year. Shanghai, which ranked second, saw a total deal value of US$3.1 billion in the first half of 2017, far behind Beijing's US$18 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What are the big names in Zhongguancun?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 1984, Chinese personal computer maker </span><span class="s3">Lenovo Group</span><span class="s1"> was among the earliest tech companies to get established in Zhongguancun. With a start-up money of 200,000 yuan (US$28,800), Liu Chuanzhi, founder of Lenovo, became one of China's first-generation tech entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the late 1990s, with increasing adoption of personal computers in the country, entrepreneur Richard Liu Qiangdong chose Zhongguancun to set up a small retail shop that has now grown into China's second largest e-commerce platform - JD.com[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2151250/google-invest-us550-million-chinese-e-commerce-giant-jdcom]. Over the past two decades, more Zhongguancun-born companies have become household names in China by providing services from online search (Baidu) to app-enabled food delivery (</span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have also become some of China's most successful businesses with 318 Zhongguancun companies raising a total of 296 billion yuan via initial public offering by the end of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from listed firms, 30 Zhongguancun companies joined CB Insights' Global Unicorn Club in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On top of the 2018 unicorn list is ByteDance[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2164304/bytedance-enter-chinas-long-form-streaming-video-market-challenging], parent of news aggregator Jinri Toutiao and video sensation Tik Tok, which was recently crowned as the world's biggest start-up with a valuation of US$75 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, the Chinese ride-hailing giant that drove </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> out of the mainland, and short video upstart Kuaishou, are also among the Zhongguancun-born unicorns.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What other areas compete with Zhongguancun in China?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite Zhongguancun's credentials as a leading incubator of tech innovation in China, it does have competition. Shanghai - which is known for its Zhangjiang hi-tech zone - ranks top in a list of global cities with the potential to become a leading technology innovation hub over the next four years, according to a </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> survey in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report, based on a survey of 767 business executives globally, ranked Beijing fifth and ranked the Greater Bay Area that includes Shenzhen and Hong Kong, 15th.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan co-founder Steven Lam Hoi-yuen faced a steep learning curve after entering into a deal that created one of Hong Kong's first unicorns about 12 months ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam had to relocate to Beijing after GoGoVan agreed to merge in August last year with the company then known as 58 Suyun, the freight business of mainland Chinese online classifieds giant 58 Home, to help ramp up expansion for the combined enterprise in the world's second largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Even though I'm also [of Chinese ethnicity], the way the [mainland] Chinese and I look at topics and issues are very different,” Lam, who serves as GoGoVan's chief executive, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In China it's more top-down, and iteration is so fast - they execute something and if it doesn't work then they [iterate] again, whereas outside China there is often a lot of testing before something is launched.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan secures US$250 million fundraising after merger[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2155213/gogovan-secures-us250-million-fundraising-after-merger]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That move has paid off as the company now operates in more than 300 cities on the mainland, up from around 100 before the merger, to make it one of the biggest players in the country's highly fragmented intra-city logistics market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said the company's business-to-business operations have rapidly developed to include more than a million registered drivers and more than eight million users on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our B2B business is growing very quickly, at double digits every month right now,” Lam said. He declined to provide specific numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is now conducting delivery trials in four mainland cities for Cainiao Network, the logistics arm of e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How a high-school dropout with big ideas founded GoGoVan, Hong Kong's first US$1bn start-up[https://www.scmp.com/tech/leaders-founders/article/2109032/how-high-school-dropout-big-ideas-founded-gogovan-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cainiao became an investor in GoGoVan in July after it took part in a US$250 million funding round for the company. Other investors in that round included the Russia-China Investment Fund, Hongrun Capital, Qianhai Fund of Funds and 58 Daojia Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stakes are high for GoGoVan in China, which is the world's biggest e-commerce market and where the company is laying the foundation to become the global leader in intra-freight services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That was the stated goal of GoGoVan and 58 Home executives when they announced in August last year the merger with 58 Suyun, which vaulted the Hong Kong start-up to unicorn status with a valuation of more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first unicorn was SenseTime Group. Based in the Hong Kong Science Park, the firm achieved a valuation of US$1.5 billion in July last year after completing its US$410 million Series B funding round.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, GoGoVan became a sort of poster child for the local start-up community. Lam is often invited to speak at entrepreneurship events and conferences in Hong Kong, where he shares his start-up story.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of GoGoVan's ambitions was to eventually list in the city, according to Lam in an interview with South China Morning Post last year. Alibaba is the parent company of the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan has had some hiccups in its China expansion. Last month, the company faced an angry backlash from its drivers on the mainland after it rebranded as Kuaigou Dache, which translates to “Hail a ride with Fast Dog”. Drivers had complained that they were on the receiving end from customers of the ultimate Chinese insult - calling a person a canine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following the merger, the company had retained the name GoGoVan in Hong Kong and other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Who are you calling a dog? Chinese delivery firm's name change has drivers barking mad[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2160562/who-are-you-calling-dog-chinese-delivery-firms-name-change-has]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We felt that the name 58 Suyun was too corporate, so we changed it to Kuaigou,” Lam said. “We wanted to convey the message that our brand was reliable and trustworthy. And [the animal] that came to mind was a dog. So Kuaigou basically means quick, efficient dog.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In spite of protests to the rebranding, Lam said he was sticking by the company's new brand name.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to become the largest platform in China so that people will think of Kuaigou whenever they want to move goods, whether the items are bulky or small,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in July 2013, GoGoVan has established a sprawling online logistics and freight operation in 14 cities across six Asian markets. It counts more than 180,000 registered drivers on its mobile application, enabling businesses and individuals to hire a driver with anything from a light-goods vehicle to a 16-tonne truck within seconds.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company first entered mainland China in 2015 after receiving US$10 million in its Series B funding round from Chinese social media firm </span><span class="s3">Renren</span><span class="s1">. Hong Kong logistics rival Lalamove followed, eventually covering 100 cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outside China, GoGoVan plans to expand into new markets across Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to have laser focus to do what we're doing right now to the best [that we can],” Lam said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Corporate spending on innovation and technology has been growing twice as fast in China than in the US over the past two years, fuelled by accelerating migration to cloud services, according to industry watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a latest research report released by US investment bank </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> , information technology (IT) spending by Chinese companies is projected to grow 11.2 per cent this year, more that double their American counterparts' 5.3 per cent rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The study, led by equity analyst Grace Chen , surveyed 126 chief information officers (CIO) in China and an undisclosed number of CIOs in the States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the scales of IT spending in both countries were not revealed, the faster growth by Chinese is clear, and is in line with figures showing data collection levels the year before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies spent 10.2 per cent more on technology last year, against 4.4 per cent in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The findings also show Chinese cloud and CRM (customer relationship management) software spending growing at its fastest click in three years, adding the winners of such acceleration are the "leading public cloud vendors, and select semi [conductor] suppliers".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The group of analysts name AliCloud and Tencent as the industry leaders in public cloud, and among the foreign players, </span><span class="s3">IBM</span><span class="s1"> outshine other competitors.Private-sector corporate investment will accelerate this year, recovering from the low levels of 2016. Lower real interest rates will stimulate investment in productivity-enhancing technologies, such as robots and cloud-based servicesGordon Orr, senior adviser to McKinsey China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our survey shows more than 30 per cent of CIOs have adopted Alicloud, and that China will maintain a similar leading share over the next three years, echoing our positive view," the </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AliCloud's parent company Alibaba owns the S outh China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"What surprised us most, was CIO's optimism about Tencent and </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> in public cloud: Tencent ranks second with a 15 per cent share predicted to rise to 23 per cent within three year," they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Katy Huberts, an equity analyst at the firm, said: "Our survey shows that </span><span class="s3">IBM</span><span class="s1"> , which is in partnership with Wanda, stands out in public cloud ahead of </span><span class="s3">Amazon Web Services</span><span class="s1"> (AWS) and Azure."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> also noted </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> , which trails AliCloud and Tencent in public cloud, tops its competitors in private cloud, a result of </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> 's competitive advantage in having a hardware business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Public clouds are typically applications and storage made available on the internet as services for all companies. In contrast, private clouds are proprietary data centres tailored specifically for one company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, those companies interviewed said about 34 per cent of their workload is handled using the cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The analysts said that figure will be bumped up to 53 per cent by the end of 2020, and more specifically, the percentage of workload on the public cloud is expected to rise from 20 per cent to 29 per cent, during the same timespan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, this still trails behind cloud adoption by US companies, however, which currently use it for 34 per cent of their workload and by the end of 2020, that'll reach 59 per cent.The size of the public cloud as a service market in China is expected to be valued at US$2.4 billion this year, up from US$1.8 billion in 2015, and then to grow to US$3.8 billion by 2020Statistics platform Statista</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Orr , senior adviser to McKinsey China, echoed </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> 's finding, that companies are increasingly spending more on technology, particularly cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Private-sector corporate investment will accelerate this year, recovering from the low levels of 2016. Lower real interest rates will stimulate investment in productivity-enhancing technologies, such as robots and cloud-based services," Orr wrote in a commentary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A separate analysis by McKinsey partner Yougang Chen, chimes against, that Chinese firms have been increasing digital engagement in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His report says domestic mainland companies are "investing heavily in the building blocks of the internet economy: cloud computing, wireless communications, new digital platforms, big data analytics".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to statistics platform Statista, the size of the public cloud as a service market in China is expected to be valued at US$2.4 billion this year, up from US$1.8 billion in 2015, and then to grow to US$3.8 billion by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, as cloud services continue to expand, companies providing more traditional IT and content delivery networks (CDNs) will face serious disruption to their business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Alicloud's success is already weighing on corporate IT vendors in China, similar to how AWS has challenged US IT suppliers," </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In China, margins for traditional server makers, (such as Lenovo, Inspur) began to soften in 2016."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That shift in the industry, meanwhile, will present opportunities for a select group of semi-conductor suppliers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The migration to solid state drives and the increasing focus on cloud computing are going to benefit several semiconductors companies, including Silicon Motion, TSMC and </span><span class="s3">Samsung Electronics</span><span class="s1"> ," </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> predicts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its equity analyst Robert Lin wrote in June that AliCloud had 500,000 paying clients, including half of the top 35 Chinese "unicorn" internet companies - start-up firms with a US$1 billion valuation, funded either publicly or by private investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Philbert Shih, managing director at Canadian firm Structure Research, in June was also projecting substantial growth for AliCloud "that would already be at historical record highs for the cloud industry".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched a decade ago, </span><span class="s3">Amazon Web Services</span><span class="s1"> ' calendar year 2020 revenue is projected to hit US$75.41 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Structure Research estimates AliCloud to post revenue of US$7.08 billion during parent Alibaba's financial year to March 31, 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> is even more aggressive, suggesting a US$8.72 billion revenue by 2020, which compares significantly with the US$7.88 billion posted by </span><span class="s3">Amazon Web Services</span><span class="s1"> last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's car market, the world's biggest, is changing fast. With “new energy”, “connected” and “autonomous” among the industry's buzzwords, tech-savvy start-ups are determined to dethrone century-old carmakers like </span><span class="s3">BMW</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Audi</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">GM</span><span class="s1"> that have dominated the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A flurry of electric car start-ups has sprouted up in recent years after the Chinese government started handing out special manufacturing permits to non-traditional carmakers, offering consumer subsidies and issuing special ownership quotas that make it easier to get licence plates for new-energy vehicles in bigger cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is also making a big push to develop artificial intelligence (AI) as part of a broader strategy to upgrade its manufacturing capabilities. AI is seen by many as the backbone technology of the “fourth industrial revolution” and its application in the development of smart cars is now a national priority, according to the country's latest three-year plan, unveiled in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, start-ups and venture capital investors in China are ploughing billions of dollars into developing the future of mobility. Here are 10 newcomers that are looking to shake up the auto industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Byton</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: Carsten Breitfeld, Daniel Kirchert</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: series A</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include: </span><span class="s3">Harmony Auto</span><span class="s1">, League Automotive Technologies, </span><span class="s3">Legend Capital</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: first production model unveiled in January, production to start in 2019</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Co-founded by two former </span><span class="s3">BMW</span><span class="s1"> executives, the company has built manufacturing facilities in Nanjing, and brands itself as a global carmaker with Chinese genes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unveiled at CES in Las Vegas, Byton's US$45,000 electric SUV features an edge-to-edge dashboard display, a tablet device on the steering wheel, facial recognition access, hand-gesture control and cloud-based data storage. Earlier this month, it announced a tie-up with autonomous technology start-up Aurora in deploying level 4 self-driving capabilities into its vehicles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is also reported to be seeking a new financing round at a minimum valuation of US$1.2 billion, which would make it the latest electric vehicle unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NIO</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: William Li</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: series D</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include: </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, Baidu, Xiaomi, Hillhouse Capital, </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: first production model unveiled in December, delivery starts in the first half of 2018</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NIO unveiled its first production model, a seven-seater high-performance electric SUV, in December, throwing down the gauntlet to US carmaker Tesla.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At half the price of Tesla's Model X, it boasts such driver-assistance features as highway pilot, automatic emergency brakes and a smart in-car system with voice control and automatic adjustment of temperature and light. The first batch of deliveries is expected to start within the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A better understanding of Chinese consumers is likely to give domestic carmakers an edge over international rivals like Tesla, said William Li, founder and chairman of the company, at the SUV's launch event in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xpeng</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: He Xiaopeng, Xia Heng</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: series B</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include: Alibaba, Foxcon, IDG Capital, Yunfeng Capital, CICC, Morning Ventures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: first production model unveiled in January, delivery starts this year</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaopeng Motor, known as Xpeng, unveiled its first production model at the CES technology show in Las Vegas. The G3 electric SUV features a windscreen that extends all the way back to mid-roof, giving occupants a sky view, Star Wars-inspired headlights - the auxiliary lamps are shaped like light sabres - and a contour that the company said resembles a shark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expected to be priced between 250,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan when it goes on sale later this year, it is in the same price bracket as </span><span class="s3">Audi</span><span class="s1">'s Q3, </span><span class="s3">Mercedes-Benz</span><span class="s1">'s GLA and </span><span class="s3">BMW</span><span class="s1">'s X1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He Xiaopeng, who co-founded Chinese mobile web browser company UCWeb and later served as president of Alibaba's mobile business group, established Xpeng in 2014. The company's list of initial investors includes Li Xueling, founder of Nasdaq-listed Chinese live-streaming social media platform operator YY, Cheetah Mobile chief executive Fu Sheng and Free Wu Xiaoguang, a senior management adviser at Tencent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, the company announced it was nearing the close of a 2.2 billion yuan funding round, adding fuel to competition among start-ups in the world's largest auto market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WM Motor</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: Freeman Shen Hui, Napoleon Du Ligang</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: first production model unveiled in December, large-scale delivery due in the second half of 2018</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WM Motor is seen as another Tesla challenger in China. The Shanghai-based start-up has announced its first model, a full-electric SUV, will go into production in the first quarter and carry a starting price of 200,000 yuan before subsidies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded by former Volvo and Geely executives, the company has raised more than 12 billion yuan over the past three years, including two rounds of fundraising led by Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The model, available to order from April, will have level-two autonomous driving capabilities, according to Shen Hui, founder and chief executive of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singulato Motor</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: Shen Haiyin</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: series A</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include: Tongling municipal investment fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: first production model unveiled in April, large-scale delivery expected in 2018</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Targeting the full-electric battery car market with a direct-sales model, Singulato Motor is seen as another Tesla challenger in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2014 by a former 360 executive, the company raised much of its second financing round of US$700 million from an investment fund run by the municipal government of Tongling city, Anhui province, in 2016, according to Reuters. The city will host its major production plant capable of producing 200,000 cars a year by around 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singulato Motor opened its first experimental store in Beijing in January, and aims to expand to 200 stores in three years in major Chinese cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CHJ Automotive</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: Li Xiang, Kevin Shen Yanan, Ma Donghui, Johny Li Tie</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: series A3</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include: Zhejiang Leo Group, Changzhou Wunan New Energy Car</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: first two production models to be released in 2018</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Co-founded by entrepreneur Li Xiang and former Auto Home executives, CHJ Automotive expects to introduce its first two production models this year, a full-electric SUV and an ultra-compact car.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The models will have a swappable battery and utilise Google's Android Auto operating system, according to the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CHJ Automotive boasts of over 90 per cent automation in its two manufacturing facilities in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, and an annual production capacity of 80 million battery cells.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JingChi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founders: Wang Jing</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Latest funding status: series A</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors include: Nvidia's GPU Ventures, Qiming Venture Partners, China Growth Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: open-road test rides in Silicon Valley and Guangzhou, robotaxi services to be introduced by year end</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JingChi, the self-driving technology start-up co-founded by Baidu's former autonomous chief Wang Jing last April, launched a three-month public test ride programme in January as part of its goal to be the first company to achieve large-scale, commercial deployment of Level 4 autonomous vehicles in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trial, however, is likely to be under scrutiny by Baidu, as the Nasdaq-listed company had sued both JingChi and its 52-year-old chief executive, Wang, in December for alleged theft of intellectual property related to self-driving technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company completed a US$52 million pre-A funding round in September last year from Qiming Venture, the GPU Ventures programme of US chip supplier </span><span class="s3">Nvidia Corp</span><span class="s1"> and a consortium of undisclosed investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pony.ai</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: open-road test rides in Silicon Valley and Guangzhou, robotaxi services to be introduced by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded by former Baidu executives and having re-located from Silicon Valley to Guangzhou, Pony.ai launched test rides of its autonomous cars in the city around the same time as JingChi earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pony.ai plans to introduce a fleet of 200 self-driving cars in Guangzhou by the end of the year, where users will be able to hail an autonomous ride through a booking app like Didi or Uber.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Talent is often said to be the key to autonomous driving, which gives the start-up an edge as it has three of China's top five coders from last year's Topcoder Open, according to Lou Tiancheng, Pony.ai's CTO. The company raised US$112 million from its Series A funding round last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Roadstar.ai</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Progress: open-road test rides in Silicon Valley, robotaxi services to be rolled out by year-end</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen-based company is another artificial intelligence start-up focused on level 4 autonomous driving.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Roadstar.ai showcased its prototype, powered by its self-driving technologies, at the CES trade show in Las Vegas in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The multi-sensor fusion technology it provides can support real-time data analysis of multiple sensors and will become a key solution to go with solid state laser radars that will significantly bring down the cost of autonomous cars, according to CEO Tong Xianqiao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TuSimple</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Headquartered in Beijing and San Diego, TuSimple aims to create the world's first commercially viable autonomous truck driving platform, with a goal to “redefine the logistics industry”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up has already begun tests of the system in Arizona and in China, and plans to move to commercial operation of cargo trucks later this year, despite the fact drivers will still sit behind the wheel for safety and legal reasons.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chengdu is seeking to become a financial industry hub in western China, leveraging its geographic location and ties to private equity, according to a top financial official of the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The megacity of 15 million has a vibrant financial service industry that's home to 74 banks, 83 insurers, 248 securities and futures firms. And while the size of the financial services industry, estimated at 125 billion yuan, pales in comparison to Beijing and Shanghai, Chengdu ranks well ahead of other second-tier cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As central bankers and finance minister of G20 nations, along with heads of multilateral financial organisations converged in Chengdu over the weekend, officials sought to highlight the city's success in attracting private equity firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yinke Venture Capital itself is a witness to the growth of Chengdu's venture capital and private equity industry. Founded in 2009 by the Chengdu government and </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> with a 1.5 billion yuan in registered capital, the entity teamed up with other fund management firms to launch 18 funds. As of April the entity had combined assets under management of 6 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu Zhong, general manager of Yinke Venture Capital said previous regulations would have required a proportion of funds be channelled into local companies, however regulators appear to have withdrawn the requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the “non-market-oriented” rule was counter productive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the project is really good, general partners certainly would invest. If not, how can you demand them to invest?” Wu said, adding recent covenants that Yinke signed with funds don't contain local investment ratio requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are bullish on Chengdu's economy, and there are enough promising startups. The question is whether they can effectively spot them, this is why we require them to operate locally,” Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Nong knows this too well. The general manager of Chengdu Detong-Yinke Capital Fund, a fund launched by Yinke and Shanghai-based Detong Capital, has overseen the fund as it appreciated 50 per cent since its founding in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said his fund was bullish about opportunities in Chengdu, particularly in defense, high-end manufacturing and agricultural technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund has invested in Huaqi Houpu Holdings, a leading natural gas station equipment provider, and Haichuan Shiye, an aircraft engine parts provider.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I'm committed to spot ‘original' unicorn companies. If the company is in Beijing and Shanghai, it would immediately be pursued by numerous funds, but here we get a unique opportunity,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A local investment banker, who requested anonymity, said Chengdu should foster its homegrown institutions. He said the city has no problem in attracting national financial giants because of its role as a gateway to huge markets in western China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recently launched New Hope Bank, headquartered in Chengdu, was founded by New Hope Group, </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">, and a local retailer to serve small businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of 2015, there were 381 angel investors, and venture capital and private equity funds in Chengdu registered under the official Asset Management Association of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recently concluded Chengdu Global Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fair attracted top venture capitalists and private equity representatives from around the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is another reason why Chengdu wants to fashion itself as a centre for private equity, according to Fu Jianfeng, assistant chief of the city's Financial Work Office.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the global financial crisis there is a reflection on previous thinking that the larger the financial service sector is, the more institutions a city houses, the better. Instead, the size of the financial sector should match its economic size,” Fu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chengdu is one of 10 mainland Chinese cities whose annual economic output has surpassed 1 trillion yuan. The city is a service hub for Sichuan province and the vast hinterland of Tibet, Guizhou and Yunnan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since Michael Chang Chun-wai has settled on sprints as the specialty for Kick Serve, the six-year-old's form as been as solid as a rock, and tomorrow night at Happy Valley a plum alley makes him the best banker in the final leg of the Triple Trio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kick Serve drops from the widest gate at the tight track last start to pole position in the Los Angeles Handicap, where he faces a field that lacks depth and contains a double-banker option.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chang stretched Kick Serve, who was placed over a mile at Listed level as a two-year-old, to 1,600m early in his Hong Kong career and even jagged a win over the extended mile at the Valley. But since dropping back to 1,200m midway through last term, Kick Serve has been a model of consistency - finishing in the top four in his last five tries at this course and distance, including a win in May, where he was drawn low over the same "A" course he faces tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The six-year-old was slow to muster that night, but Douglas Whyte was still able to maintain the coveted position three back on the fence as the leaders went crazy in front. Zac Purton will be hoping to be similarly positioned in the run here, although there is no guarantee of speed - but the erratic head case, Apollo Cavalier, could do anything from gate three, being his first time at the track. He is the likely leader and it's easy to imagine him stringing this field along.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purton was forced to restrain Kick Serve last start, where he was first-up from gate 12, and closed off well to finish an eye-catching third behind Best Win, despite not having the clearest run in the straight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Finishing second in that race was Cape Canaveral, with Whyte aboard for the first time, and he lines up again drawn the same gate as his last start (five). He appeals as a second banker in a weak field.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After a first-up run at Sha Tin, Cape Canaveral has taken on the look of a progressive individual, finishing in the top three in all three starts on the smaller track, including an early-season win at his first try.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is the likely favourite and shouldn't let TT players down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also include Gamekeepers (Brett Prebble), despite the John Size-trained four-year-old continuing his run of wide gates, and another runner cruelled by his draw (10) Smart Kids (Howard Cheng Yue-tin). Despite his behavioural issues and nervous disposition, Apollo Cavalier (Jacky Tong Chi-kit) is the knoc-out chance, or perhaps Richard Gibson's Spurs On (Tim Clark) can improve off his debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first leg - the Detroit Handicap, a Class Four over 1,000m - looks tough to have any confidence about, but there's little doubt Call Me Achiever (Alvin Ng Ka-chun) is above this grade in ability - it's just a matter of whether you can bank on the apprentice handling being drawn in gate eight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Flashing Guy (Andreas Suborics) is the solid speed map choice as a banker - drawn three and coming into the race off four straight top-four finishes - including three placings from his last three tries at the track and distance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">D Day Super (Olivier Doleuze), Bless Us All (Derek Leung Ka-chun) and Spicy Shrimp (Tong) are the others to consider.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle pin is the most competitive contest of the three, a Class Four over 1,650m, with three last-start winners entered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bank on top weight Fortune Bravo (Doleuze) saying goodbye to the grade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another banker option, if you can ignore an unconvincing recent barrier trial, is Intellectualstride (Weichong Marwing).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He broke through over the course and distance late last term, albeit it in restricted company, but maps well from gate two in a race that should be run to suit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Intellectualstride comes in off an eye-catching run-on fifth over 1,200m at Sha Tin, where he was held up for a run at a crucial stage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whyte gets on Real Dragon, and gets gate one, while Brilliant Chariot (Tong) and Dragon Pins (Purton) are other options.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TRACK STARS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">RACE 1: (1) Sunny Sky, (3) Mount Victory, (6) Noble Flier, (10) Gorgeous Ruler.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size goes into Sunday's Longines Hong Kong Sprint with nearly as many runners in this edition as he has ever had in the race and is quietly proud his firm grip on one of the world's great sprint races is vindication of his general approach.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size has run just five horses in the Hong Kong Sprint, with Entrapment's photo-finish second to Lucky Nine six years ago his nearest result, so four on one day, including most of the favourites, is a big achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He knows there are no guarantees - last May, he had four in the Chairman's Sprint Prize and five in the Group Three Sha Tin Vase and didn't win either - but he is not knocking the mob-handed approach.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It seemed to work out well in the Jockey Club Sprint, so I'm pretty happy having numbers when all the horses are all well and in-form and, by their handicap ratings, are good enough to win," Size said. "D B Pin is off a local rating of 120, which is quite a significant, yet the others are higher, so there is real quality among them."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having Mr Stunning, Thewizardofoz, Amazing Kids and D B Pin going to post in the Sprint also offers compelling evidence for what may not be strictly described as Size's philosophy but an approach that has the foundation of his dominance - unraced horses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amazing Kids had run twice before his arrival here on a 68 rating - ironically, he would not be permitted entry under the current policies - but the other three were PPGs (Private Purchase Griffins), unraced horses bought off barrier trial performances at best.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Size set to have four runners in the Hong Kong Sprint after Mr Stunning leads home a stable tierce[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2120610/john-size-set-have-four-runners-hong-kong-sprint-after-mr-stunning]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size says he has no problem with training previously raced horses, and has had big successes with Electronic Unicorn, Grand Delight, Super Kid, River Dancer, Glorious Days and others. But developing a horse over time, from the ground up, provides the bulk of his winners and considerable professional satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It isn't lost on me and, yes, it's a satisfying thing to get them this far and I hope there is more in the pipeline - Nothingilikemore, Beat The Clock, Premiere, Hot King Prawn are all PPGs," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think I'm flexible, I'm open to previously raced horses, of course, and Amazing Kids is proof that both can work, but there are things I like about PPGs. For one thing, you know that it's all your own work. And there's the Forrest Gump factor - you never know what you'll get with an unraced horse. You could get anything."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There's also the transfer of manners and routines put in place by a previous handler when Size takes on a horse which has already had a racing preparation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Welcome return to the Group One fold as Olivier Doleuze retains Hong Kong Sprint ride on D B Pin[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2122606/welcome-return-group-one-fold-olivier-doleuze-retains-hong-kong-sprint]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A horse learns certain habits and maybe they don't line up with my methods," Size said. "So, when the horse gets to me, I have to work through that. That can take time, depending on the horse, and owners are not always as patient with PPs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A horse with performances on the board has cost more money than an unraced one. The owner can get itchy to see returns and that doesn't encourage patience, which is a big part of how you train any horse. So there are some advantages in unraced horses."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Thursday's draw still ahead, Size says he is unable to separate his four runners except by their handicap figures and says his highest hope is "to see them all cross the line together".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But luck in running will separate them, and there are other runners who will have a say in the result, let's not forget that," Size said. "But Mr Stunning has the highest rating and keeps turning up and running well. Thewizardofoz looked special winning the 1,400m race at the end of last season with a true pace but we've been having very stop-start sprints this season and that hasn't suited him quite as well. If we get pace on Sunday, we know he's going to be very strong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Amazing Kids has had a good prep, he is stronger and healthier than when he ran fourth last year in this race. D B Pin is the lowest-rated but he has always had a good win rate and showed last run that he was right up to running well in this company. I'm pretty comfortable with them as a group."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments in mainland China's technology, media and telecommunications sector are polarising even as the segment maintains its popularity among investors, global professional services firm PwC said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector's popularity still dwarfs other industries as it accounted for more than half of total PE and VC investments in mainland China in 2016, according to PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PE and VC investment in the TMT sector grew to US$59 billion in 2016, up 61.5 per cent year on year. On quarterly basis, deal value dropped in the third and fourth quarter after it rose to a high of US$20 billion in the second quarter thanks to fund-raising by a number of unicorn companies - those whose valuation is more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The slowdown in the TMT sector occurred a bit later than the overall [PE and VC investments] and it remained an attractive sector for PE and VC investors,” said Gao Jianbin, PwC China TMT leader in Shanghai. “Notably, investment is highly concentrated and polarised.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On one hand, there were a vast number of small deals, indicating relatively low value, whilst on the other hand, a small number of big deals acted as major contributor to deal value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, 52 deals valued at more than US$100 million each accounted for about half of total investment value in the TMT sector in the second half, during which there were a total of 1,478 deals, according to PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The trend might well roll on into 2017,” Gao said, referring it to a seemingly “winner takes all” trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caution over uncertainty is especially palpable in first-round investments, which accounted for 13 per cent of total investment in the TMT sector in the second half, with a majority of deals featuring a single-deal value below US$5 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In geographic terms, Beijing remains the top spot for investment both in deal value and volume, way ahead of the rest of the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the near term, we expect Beijing to naturally remain as the most attractive place thanks to its ample number of investable deals there,” said Alvin Bao, a PwC partner in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other major hot spots for deals included Shanghai, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-based travel activity booking site Klook said on Wednesday that it has raised almost US$60 million in the latest round of funding giving further impetus to its overseas expansion plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With its fresh funds, Klook plans to expand to North America, Europe and Australia, bringing new travel experiences in these places to outbound Asian travellers, as well as to inbound tourists visiting Asia from these regions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This round of funding gives us additional resources to further strengthen our leading position in Asia while accelerating expansion into new markets and verticals," said Ethan Lin, chief executive of Klook, in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Klook, which was founded in Hong Kong in 2014, now has 13 offices across Asia and over 400 employees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lalamove on track to become next start-up unicorn from Hong Kong [http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2114913/lalamove-track-become-next-start-unicorn-hong-kong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest round of financing was led by venture capital firm </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> , and includes investors such as </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Matrix Partners</span><span class="s1"> , together with several Asia-based family funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Klook currently brings in over 1 million monthly bookings with the majority of its customers coming from Asia, according to the company. The company offers discounted deals on travel attraction tickets, travel activities and even food and dining experiences for its users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Originally a site centred around desktop-bookings, Klook shifted to a mobile-first strategy within its first year and now counts 70 per cent of its bookings via mobile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eric Gnock Fah, co-founder and president of Klook, said in an interview with the Post that its largest market currently is mainland China, where the company also has an office.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Southeast Asia is growing very quickly as well ... with the increase in first-time travellers," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to its latest funding round, Klook had raised over US$36 million in venture capital financing. The company declined to reveal its current valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Klook's success in the travel activity booking space is in part because of its unique experiences offered and its emphasis on localisation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Klook serves many markets, Gnock Fah said that the mobile app displays different recommended activities based on where the user was using the app and the language the app was being used in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the app is used in simplified Chinese, the recommended activities shown by the app would be more experience-based and less tour focused, Gnock Fah said, since data has shown that mainland Chinese tourists are less inclined to book tours.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asian tourists, however, are more likely to book day trips and tours around a new destination, and hence such activities would be recommended to them more, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Klook also works with tour operators to customise tours, preventing a "cookie-cutter" experience, Gnock Fah said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company also hires in-house travel curators who personally experience and curate travel activities before listing them on the app, to ensure that its users will have a good experience.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Chinese investors would regularly call Zhao Xiuwen, founder and CEO of Beijing-based ZingFront, to pitch their interest in investing in his artificial intelligence-driven video production start-up, but since the beginning of this year, he's had to reach out himself - often with little success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fundraising has become harder than ever for us recently,” said Zhao. “There is less money in the capital market and competition has become more fierce.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pain Zhao is feeling has been dubbed “the winter of capital” by Chinese investors and entrepreneurs. In response to a domestic economic slowdown, Chinese financial regulators have stepped up financial deleveraging measures to reduce bad debt risks. As a result, the number of Limited Partners (LPs) that invest in venture capital deals and private equity funds has decreased, along with financing from banks, shrinking the pool of cash to fund start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An investor working for an RMB venture capital firm told the Post that one of its LPs recently failed to transfer the second instalment of an investment it had promised. The representative requested anonymity due to the private nature of the information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is the coldest winter for capital in 10 years,” said Zhao Tian, founding partner of Beijing-based 36Kr Fund, at a conference organised by the firm last Tuesday. 36Kr, originally an online platform offering news about technology and start-ups, was expanded into a crowdfunding investment platform for start-ups in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of new private equity funds in the first half of 2018 was 3,111, down 59.5 per cent from the same period a year earlier, according to a report by Jingdata, a start-up database from 36Kr. Also during the first half, 579.5 billion yuan (US$84.3 billion) of equity investments were made, down 10.7 per cent year-on-year, according to Zero2IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital raised by investment firms for seed funding was only 3.82 billion yuan (US$559 million) during the first six months of 2018, a 53 per cent drop year-on-year, according to research firm Zero2IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/17/fa5fc65c-b9a7-11e8-b64d-19e275708746_image_hires_113536.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Venture capital investors have had to adapt to the colder climate, either by putting on a brave face or adjusting their strategies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As a VC, when the market is good, you have to work hard, but when the market goes bad, you have to work even harder,” said Gao Xiang, founding partner of Beijing-based Banyan Capital, which manages a fund worth more than 11 billion yuan (US$1.6 billion) and has e-commerce disrupter Pinduoduo and on-demand service giant </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> in its portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The temporary difficulties won't affect long-term opportunities,” said Gao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investors are a hardy bunch after all, having weathered several storms over the past five years, including the stock market crash in 2015 and the circuit breaker crisis of 2016. However, some veteran Chinese investors sound more like the character Jon Snow from the TV series Game of Thrones - “winter is coming” they say, with an edge of caution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market has its own cycle and is all about investor confidence,” said Roger Liu, managing director of Shanghai-based private equity firm V-Capital. This time, investors might not re-gain their confidence so quickly as the uncertainties are mounting - including a domestic economic slowdown and brewing US-China trade war, said Liu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu's team, the M&amp;A fund of V-Capital, has felt the colder weather effects. It just raised a new round of funding this year after an effort of nearly ten-months, taking a lot longer that what was needed over the previous three years. “During the good times, we'd often see an injection of money after just a casual discussion with investors,” Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu says he's now switched his focus from placing new investments to taking good care of the companies he's already invested in, because in the current environment ensuring healthy growth at invested companies is likely to yield better returns than planting new seeds in hard ground.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After Alibaba and Xiaomi, GGV Capital's Hans Tung is looking for China tech's next big thing[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2156484/after-alibaba-and-xiaomi-ggv-capitals-hans-tung-looking-china-techs-next-big]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the good times in 2016 and 2017, Chinese investors chased investment hotspots one after another, from bike sharing to virtual reality (VR), from augmented reality (AR) to autonomous vending shops [convenience stores with no human employees designed around facial and object recognition technology], raising valuations in the primary market to sky-high levels. Bike sharing firm Mobike was valued as high as US$3.5 billion, according to Chinese magazine Caijing, but was eventually bought by Meituan in April for US$2.7 billion, down 23 per cent from its peak valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fallout could also be seen when investor darlings such as video-streamer </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> and smartphone maker Xiaomi went public - sliding on their market debuts. And there is no current “investment hotspot” in China after the autonomous vending shop concept came along at the end of 2017, which is a sign that the era of easy money may have ended for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a good time for everyone to rethink the essence of investment, which is based on solid market research instead of blindly chasing the trend,” Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Ye, founding manager of Beijing-based venture capital firm Cyanhill Capital, feels market conditions have normalised to some extent as valuations for seed round start-ups seeking funding have already fallen from around 60 million yuan in 2016-17 to around 30-40 million yuan this year - with some even below 10 million yuan. Zhang says that although market conditions will be tough during the second half, he thinks there could be a thaw after next year's Spring Festival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As such, he's divided the year into two halves - with less investment in the first half and more in the second. He invested very little in the first half - less than 10 deals - in order to keep more firepower for later in the year, when invested start-ups are likely to require new capital injections.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some investors have looked for opportunities in the education sector to keep them in the game, betting on the Chinese mindset that “education is the last thing to sacrifice during hard times”. Education, a bright spot amid the encroaching dark of winter, attracted 14.7 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) of funding during the first half, almost equal to the total for 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based </span><span class="s3">Matrix Partners</span><span class="s1"> is one of the investors focused on education, running funds worth 30 billion yuan (US$4.4 billion). It has invested in 20 education firms so far - including unicorn VIPKid, which connects global English-speaking teachers with Chinese kids.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although RMB investors will have to stick with the current “capital winter”, no matter how cold it is, Chinese start-ups will do everything they can to survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jason Sun, founder and CEO of the Beijing-based blockchain gaming platform Krypton, said he is actively looking to raise more capital from the US. “The Chinese gaming industry is seeing very tepid interest from Chinese investors,” said Sun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's not much of a surprise given the smaller pool of money available, fewer exit opportunities and the fact that hardly any new gaming companies have secured approval to list in the domestic market. The approval rate for IPOs in the domestic stock market was only 49 per cent in the first half, compared with 79 per cent last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a familiar pair teaming up to win the best race on Saturday's card, with John Size and Joao Moreira taking out the Class Two Shek Mun Handicap (1,400m) with Mr So And So.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite the four-year-old holding out the impressive Superich, Size was realistic about a horse that has now won two on the trot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He did a good job. He's not over endowed with talent, I wouldn't think, but he's a good little workman horse, he does his job,” Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Both times he's won he's had good gates and perfect runs, but at least he's won, some of them don't.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether he'd step up to a higher mark and win again is problematic, it just gets tougher and tougher for him but he's certainly done well so far.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Better late than never! Joao Moreira ends 2018 on a winning note as the progressive Mr So And So gets the better of a duel with hot favourite Superich in R10 at Sha Tin #HKracing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKracing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/t1C636bfw0[https://t.co/t1C636bfw0]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) December 29, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1078955343818813441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the four-year-old series kicking off in less than a month, trainers are assembling their hands for a tilt at the three races but Size is not sure Mr So And So will be part of his assault.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I'm not sure if he's up to that, but the owners will probably want me to run him in something,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Superich started the race as a white-hot $1.6 favourite but had to come from a long way back and ultimately left his run too late.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He had his chance today, I was a touch disappointed in his effort,” jockey Zac Purton said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mr So And So's victory was the only one for both Size and Moreira on the day, with the Magic Man overcoming a run of near misses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not that it has been all doom and gloom for the Brazilian - he rode a winner in the third race at Happy Valley on Wednesday - but he has ridden six seconds and three thirds in between victories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many jockeys would take that haul with open arms, but there was no doubt some frustration for Moreira.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sha Tin Racecourse celebrated its 40th anniversary on Saturday and it was a special day for Peter Ho Leung, who has been around since the beginning and has spent most of his working life at the track.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ho marked the occasion with victory in the day's feature race, taking out the ­Sha Tin Racecourse 40th Anniversary Cup with I Am Power before reflecting on his decades of involvement in Hong Kong racing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I joined the Jockey Club riding school in 1978 and after I graduated from riding school I started my job here [at Sha Tin],” Ho said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After working as an assistant trainer until 1997, Ho graduated to the full-time ranks and has trained over 500 winners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ex-Irish I Am Power lands the Sha Tin Racecourse 40th Anniversary Cup on just his second start in Hong Kong. The three-year-old, trained by Peter Ho and ridden by Dylan Mo, comes home strongly from stall 1 to wear down favourite California Archer. #HKracing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKracing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/ZKi1vT8zsk[https://t.co/ZKi1vT8zsk]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) December 29, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1078914804574609408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 59-year-old liked what he saw from I Am Power, a three-year-old having just his second start in Hong Kong despite being here for over a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gelding arrived in November last year and joined Michael Freedman's stable but did not race for the Australian before shifting to the Casper Fownes' yard in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was on the move again over summer, teaming up with Ho and going on to finish sixth on debut on the all-weather track in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He won for the first time in Ireland as a two-year-old and when I got him I liked him a lot because he was so professional,” Ho said of I Am Power, who recorded a win and a second from two starts in Ireland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“His last run on dirt the jockey missed the kick and he finished very strong and after that race I supposed I would put him in another dirt race three weeks later but unfortunately he got a cut when he went to swim.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That's why he had two months off but this is only a minor problem and then I put him back to work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He is not in top condition but still had the quality to win this race. The field in this race is not very strong, that's why he can win this race.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dylan Mo Hin-tung was in the saddle and posted a welcome winner but it wasn't all smiles for the jockey, who was hit with a two-meeting suspension for careless riding, which he will serve on January 6 and 9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Silvestre de Sousa continued his amazing form with another double at Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Brazilian, who was crowned champion jockey of Britain for the third time in 2018, has now secured winners in eight of the past nine meetings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Saturday, he kicked things off with the Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained M Reborn in the Class Five Wo Che Handicap (1,200m) before piloting home Pearl Champion in the Class Four Chun Shek Handicap to give trainer Tony Millard his 600th Hong Kong winner.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only @zpurton[https://twitter.com/zpurton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] has ridden more winners in Hong Kong than Silvestre de Sousa in the last two months. The Brazilian matches his previous best Hong Kong total of 16 as M Reborn charges down the outside to land R2 at Sha Tin #HKracing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKracing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/YMZMoGf4iD[https://t.co/YMZMoGf4iD]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) December 29, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1078896923061276672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That gives De Sousa 17 winners here so far since arriving at the start of November, exceeding the efforts from his previous two stints (16 winners each).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since arriving, he has collected more winners than everyone except for Zac Purton, and while he still has two months remaining on his licence, some are wondering whether that might be extended.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Jockey Club would certainly be keen for that to happen, but given his family situation (he has a third child due in spring) and potential opportunities, he might decide to head back to Europe. But watch this space.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the Lunar New Year rolls round once again, we look at how some of Hong Kong's personalities celebrated in their childhood, and discover which traditions they have held on to.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bonnie Gokson (restaurateur and owner of Sevva) "I was raised in a large home where manners and traditions were of utmost importance. At Lunar New Year, my mum would dress me in pretty clothes and new silk cocoon jackets, using lots of reds. The maids and gardeners would prepare our home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our family was known for giving large parties, so friends and relatives would come at noon, and I would compare my lai see with my cousins'. The grown ups would be in kwar, Chinese embroidered costumes, and my parents, aunts and uncles would be in the main living room to receive the guests. Everybody would gather around our dining table laden with dishes prepared by our main chef, Yuk Tse, and his team.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These days, since my family and relatives mostly live abroad or travel all over the world, it's harder to celebrate. Lunar New Year is about family togetherness. I clean and dress up my home in a festive manner to prepare for the new year. If members of my family are around, we gather for dinner: home-made dim sum - sticky rice dumplings with both savoury and sweet fillings wrapped in a leaf; delicious fried sticky rice balls that pop up like big balloons, with the centre hollowed out or filled with red bean paste.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there is also pun fan, a rice cake served with a chicken broth from my grandfather's province. [There's also] duck soup with lotus seeds and barley, braised pork shank with sea moss, and many other dishes."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grace Lin (author of Dumpling Days and Round is a Mooncake) "The memories I hold most dear are of friends and family being together. I grew up in an area [of upstate New York] that was mostly Caucasian. However, Lunar New Year was still a time of celebration. All the Asian families that lived within driving distance would gather together and have a party. Everyone, dressed in their finest, would bring a Chinese dish or two - I remember tables full of food, and talking, laughing and eating. There were red paper signs with Chinese words for decorations, fake firecrackers, and home-made dragon masks for the kids.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My mother always made a big dinner - a whole fried fish and dumplings - and the phone would ring all night with relatives and friends calling. My father loved resolutions and we wrote them for the year. When I was a child they were always unrealistic -`ride a unicorn', `win a million dollars'. My father would collect them and give us red packets. We didn't wash our hair (so not to wash away our luck) and stayed up as late as possible (the longer we stayed awake, the longer our parents would live)."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Yeo (founder of Aqua Restaurant Group) "Lunar New Year means a sense of renewal - taking stock of what happened the previous year, and how I can do better. My memories of Lunar New Year as a child? I have nightmares of taking off and putting on my new shoes 20 times in a day. I come from a big, traditional family. My father was the youngest of six brothers and sisters, so we all had to troop from one uncle's house to the next. Looking back, I should ask my mother whether it was her plan to use her children to collect as much lai see as possible in a single day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today my favourite part of Lunar New Year is the reunion dinner with my family and my mother's cooking. For someone who only took it up after she retired, she's a living rebuttal to anyone who thinks we are too old to discover latent talents. I appreciate the values that underpin our traditions: the Asian values of respect for our elders, and the strong bond of family ties even with our extended families. We continue to celebrate that, albeit over an electric hotpot instead of charcoal these days."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sin Sin Man (Atelier owner) "As a child I remember filling the house with the most beautiful and colourful flowers to bring good luck - lots of red, pink and gold. The kitchen would be busy and full of energy for weeks, as grandma prepared traditional food, especially cakes and sweets. We cleaned the house from top to bottom - we called it sai bai bai - and shopped until we dropped: bed sheets, slippers, lingerie, a whole new outfit!</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lunar New Year's Eve dinner at home was a must for the whole family, and after dinner we all sat around drinking special tea and catching up on news, such as which cousin was going to the United States or London to study, or who was getting married in the coming months. I loved staying up late to help grandma prepare the red packets for the next morning. She would tell us stories about how she celebrated Lunar New Year as a child on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, Lunar New Year for me is still all about colour, energy, joy, luck, fortune and blessings - and I love it all. I continue to enjoy family gatherings, the cleaning of house and mind, decorating with beautiful flowers, getting rid of old stuff and bad energy, while welcoming new refreshing energy - and also the good long holiday! One of my favourite holiday foods is ton yuen: sticky rice dumpling filled with yellow sugar in ginger soup. Every time I taste it I feel strongly Chinese, and my memories come flooding back."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dominica Yang (cooking enthusiast and author) "The best part of Lunar New Year for me is the food. I remember the new year snacks from my childhood - turnip pudding, chestnut pudding, yam croquettes, melon seeds, different types of sweets, lotus seed tea and more. These were among my favourites that we received, along with lai see, when I visited grandparents, aunts, uncles, close relatives and friends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, our Lunar New Year celebrations are rather different. Unfortunately, our three sons study outside of Hong Kong, so we tend to visit them over the holidays and miss Lunar New Year in Hong Kong. However, it is still a special time for the family, and we continue to serve traditional New Year snacks and give lai see. We love turnip pudding, which we make every year to enjoy ourselves, but also to give away to family and friends".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UBTech Robotics, the Chinese maker of Star Wars Stormtrooper robots that can respond to voice commands and recognise faces, is close to raising US$400 million in a funding round led by Tencent, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If completed, the series C funding round could value the Shenzhen-based company at about US$4 billion, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The funding is still being finalised and details could still change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would also be among the biggest rounds of fundraising by a consumer robotics firm, underscoring investor interest in backing companies that are marrying hardware with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, voice and facial recognition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UBTech declined to comment, while Tencent didn't immediately respond to a query.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies are raising funds to boost research and development into AI systems that will enhance everything from companion robots to education to autonomous cars. The sector has also attracted interest from overseas companies, with US mobile chip giant </span><span class="s3">Qualcomm Technologies</span><span class="s1"> investing an undisclosed sum in Hong Kong-based AI start-up SenseTime Group, which specialises in facial recognition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will this robot start-up be the next Tencent in the era of artificial intelligence?[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2110038/will-robot-start-be-next-tencent-ai-era] [https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2117476/chinas-tencent-leads-funding-us-educational-robot-firms-push-asian]Known for its humanoid robots, UBTech's latest product is the US$300 Star Wars First Order Stormtrooper Robot - created in partnership with </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1">, which owns </span><span class="s3">Lucasfilm</span><span class="s1">, the production company behind the Star Wars franchise. The Stormtrooper robot comes with an app for an augmented reality game that allows the user to look through its eyes and command it to launch "raids" by voice command. The company has begun taking orders for the robot and will begin deliveries later this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UBTech previously raised US$20 million in a series A funding round led by Qiming Venture Partners, and US$100 million in a series B funding round in 2016, led by CDH Investments. The company said it became a unicorn - the term given to start-up companies valued at more than US$1 billion - in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other UBTech products include the Alpha 1 Pro, which can be programmed to dance, play music and even do yoga. Last July, the company partnered with Apple to sell its Jimu Robot Meebot kit aimed at teaching kids how to code and build robots. UBTech also has a customer service robot called Cruzr that can interact with users to provide directions and information at places like an airport or hotel.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2012 by James Chow, known as the "father of robots" in China, the company has plans to introduce a robot that will feature Amazon's voice control system Alexa, the same system that powers Amazon's Echo smart speaker.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Tencent, the investment in UBTech would be the latest in its push into robotics and education companies.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, things are a lot different. The jade roller is not a new fad, but a centuries-old device with properties based around ideas in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the Qing dynasty, emperors used the power of jade to draw out negative ‘chi' [energy],” explains Misty Stewart, spa director at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong. “Jade rollers have been considered a long-guarded treasure by Chinese royalty. In Chinese medicine, jade is referred to as the ‘stone of heaven' and represents health, wealth, longevity and prosperity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike their Western counterparts, Chinese beauty bloggers are not gushing over the ancient derma rollers and sending followers to e-commerce sites to buy their own. In China, rollers can be found atop hawkers' dusty tables in front of tourist sites like the Forbidden City, which is where Beijing resident Hellen Shen found hers a number of years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen says at first she simply thought the tool was beautiful, and it mostly sat in her room unused. Later, she saw one of the characters in a popular Chinese television drama, Empresses in the Palace, using a jade roller, and it inspired her to use it more often. She now keeps it in her fridge to enhance the jade stone's natural cooling properties and uses it to massage facial oil into her skin, using gentle, circular motions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York-based facialist Ling Chan, who grew up in Hong Kong, has a theory as to why jade rollers blew up in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The internet spreads ideas very quickly, and everyone wants to learn beauty secrets from Asia,” she says. “Plus, it's easy to get and to use. It's such a low investment that everyone can do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared to the often pricey single-use face masks that K-beauty is known for, and hi-tech Japanese facial massagers available at </span><span class="s3">Saks Fifth Avenue</span><span class="s1">, the jade roller certainly stands out for its affordability. One can cost as little as US$10 on Amazon (and they can run even cheaper on Taobao), but Ling warns that consumers should make they are getting real jade. She sells her own version of the roller for US$90, which she says is priced for its quality - for one, the metal does not squeak on the stone when rolled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan introduced the tool at her Ling Skin Care outposts in Manhattan after first coming across one at a tourist site during a trip to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sceptics argue that the roller is no more than a massage tool that possibly helps drain lymph nodes and has anti-inflammatory properties. Chan, however, is so set in her belief in jade that she uses the stone in her other daily routines as well. In 2002, she even made headlines for sleeping with a 9-inch by 15-inch (23cm by 38cm) jade pillow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite its accessibility, is the jade roller just another 24-carat gold Korean beauty mask or unicorn body scrub for millennials?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Celebrities in the beauty and wellness industry are always looking for the next all-natural, accessible, DIY fad. Lifestyle brand Goop, for example, which drew criticism for promoting jade eggs to improve sexual health, is now touting derma rollers made from rose quartz - a crystal associated with love in feng shui - that are supposed to have similar soothing effects on the skin as jade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, facials based on the principals of gua sha - a TCM-based detoxing technique that involves repeatedly scraping the skin with a smooth, blunt instrument - have recently appeared. Performed to cure breakouts or relieve dryness, the process involves dragging a slim slab of jade or rose quartz across the skin of the face.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Back in China, jade is being injected into spa packages in the form of luxurious, traditional Chinese experiences as more spas embrace a combination of both modern and traditional wellness techniques. The Chi Spa at Beijing's China World Summit Wing hotel, for example, offers an “Empress Imperial Jade Journey”, a three-hour full body scrub and massage, topped off with a jade facial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stewart says the “Imperial Jade Ritual” at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong spa - which features jade roller facials - is one of their most popular. The two-hour service starts with a herbal compress and reflexology to open meridian energy lines, then moves on to a Chinese-style massage followed by a sesame and ground-rice scrub, and then a green tea and algae body mask. It finishes with a ginseng face mask massaged in with jade rollers, “ensuring equilibrium in mind and body”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The jade roller treatments are popular for people that prefer a natural alternative to technology,” Stewart says. “Many guests of ours have bought jade rollers at our retailer after the treatment so they could continue to use them at home and enjoy the benefits.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, however, believes millennial Chinese consumers are not going to be flooding their </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> Moments feed with the tool any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Every Chinese consumer knows the benefits of jade, but they love to look to the West for inspiration,” she says. “Consumers in China are constantly chasing the trends on the other side of the world.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed live-streaming games platform Wuhan Douyu Network Technology Co is planning an initial public offering in Hong Kong to raise as much as US$700 million, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is aiming for a listing in the third quarter this year, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Douyu declined to comment on its listing plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2014, Douyu has grown into a unicorn - a term for start-ups that have a valuation over US$1 billion - and was valued at over US$2.4 billion in its latest round of fundraising in March, when Tencent invested US$630 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides live-streaming games, the Wuhan-based company broadcasts a range of video content, including outdoor thrills and cookery lessons. Douyu topped a December list of the fastest-growing technology companies in Asia-Pacific, with a surge in revenue of over 700 times over the past three years, according to global accounting and consultancy firm Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By most accounts China is home to the biggest active user base of live streaming, with industry revenue expected to grow from last year's US$5.5 billion to US$16.5 billion by 2022, according to figures included in a filing by Huya, another Chinese live-streaming game platform listed on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total revenue from China's live-streaming games market is expected to see “significant growth” and reach US$4.9 billion by 2022, according to the Huya filing. China also has the world's largest games market in terms of revenue and gamers, according to consultancy Frost &amp; Sullivan Research. The country had 646 million gamers as of last year and this is expected to grow to 917 million by 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huya, a subsidiary of the live-streaming platform YY, started trading in New York in mid-May this year, with its stock rising from US$12 to US$29.50, as of the close of trading on Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's municipal government has imposed a moratorium on the 15 bicycle-renting services and applications operating in the Chinese capital, barring them from putting any more vehicles on roads that are already choking with 2.4 million two-wheeled rental conveyances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local authorities of the city, with more than 20 million residents, said it would step up efforts to ensure rental bicycles are only parked in designated, approved spots, according to the government's announcement posted on Weibo, a </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1">-like service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement makes Beijing the 11th city after Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and others to tighten the leash around more than 40 bicycle-rental companies that have sprouted all over the country, with an estimated 16 million rental bicycles in Chinese cities, according to the transport authority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While they vastly add to the “last mile” convenience to city commuters, the ride-anywhere and park-anywhere business models of most of these services mean they're almost always parked haphazardly, which soon become an unsightly public nuisance to the cityscape.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The service is the latest to have taken over China's “sharing economy,” a business model built around smartphone-enabled applications that shared resources from bicycles to prams and even battery chargers and umbrellas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese Bike-sharing services attract more than 100 million users in the past year[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2105609/chinese-bike-sharing-services-attract-more-100-million-users-past]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bicycle renting's growth had been explosive in the past year, with up to 106 million people using various smartphone-enabled services as at the end of June, according to August data by the China internet Network Information Centre, the Chinese government's online industry research facility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leading the pack are two bicycle renters backed by two of China's largest internet companies. Mobike is backed by Tencent, the operator of the dominant Chinese social network, while Ofo is backed by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which runs the world's largest online shopping platform, and owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two Beijing-based services -- each a “unicorn” with its business valued at more than US$1 billion -- are fighting for market share and dominance by flooding city streets with their bicycles, each identifiable by a unique colour, to attract new users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Changzhou Youon Public Bicycle System</span><span class="s1">, the first of the ride-sharing companies to raise funds through an initial public offering, has tripled in value less than a month since its August 17 listing. Youon's shares rose to as much as 100.30 yuan each on August 31. It now carries a market cap of 7.76 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) at a price of 80.85 yuan on Thursday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tupilaks were violent spirits conjured by powerful shamans using animal and human remains (particularly those of children), and they were supposed to come to life when placed in water. Only superior sorcery could deflect their attack.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That might sound like something out of Harry Potter or role-playing video games but tupilaks are, in fact, mythical beings from Inuit lore in Greenland. If you are curious about what they look like, there is one in the Hong Kong Museum of Art right now. This animal-human hybrid figure is made of wood and bone and is one of the smaller - and strangest-looking - artefacts from a British Museum touring exhibition titled "Fantastic Creatures".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Showcasing 170 items spanning many thousands of years (from paleolithic times to the present day), and across different cultures and civilisations, the exhibition primarily looks at an array of mythical creatures and beasts, and traces their origins and stories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So there are the usual suspects: the Greek gorgon Medusa, the Egyptian sphinx, the Chinese dragon, Indian gods and goddesses, as well as the unicorn and mermaid of European folklores. Then there are the lesser-known "thunderbird" of the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe in Canada, the Japanese tengu and the Balinese winged lion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exhibition also looks at how, throughout the ages, humans have looked to the supernatural for answers and protection in times of fear and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The show is thematically divided into nine sections to give the exhibits context. For instance, the "Good and Evil" segment looks at the symbolic meanings of dragons and serpents in different cultures. So while the dragon is regarded as auspicious by the Chinese, it is something more sinister in the West. "Fact and Fiction" looks at unicorns and lions, "At the Boundaries" focuses on sphinx and part-human creatures, while "Fear and Protection" shows how demonic masks are worn in rituals to ward off or exorcise evil spirits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The items on display are diverse in form and medium, ranging from ceramics and sculpture to etchings and masks, some of which are of stunning quality. An archaistic jade ring from the 18th to the 19th century, shaped in the form of a coiled dragon, is beautifully carved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is a comprehensive exhibition that highlights how different yet similar our ancestors were when it came to spiritual beliefs and superstitions. Because of the quantity of artefacts on show, this show warrants multiple visits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, those with young children might want to avoid the "Fear and Protection" section: some of the demon masks are scary.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There aren't many meat eaters who dislike fried chicken. It's not something they would consume every day, but give them the chance to eat it and few would say no; when I told friends and colleagues about the plan to do a tasting of fast-food fried chicken, many of them were eager to help out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the end, though, I went with only one colleague, SCMP's arts editor Kevin Kwong. Before our day-long tasting, we set out the criteria for good fried chicken. We agreed that although the chicken is deep-fried, it shouldn't be too oily. The skin should be crisp and the meat should be moist. With the best fried chicken, you'll want to continue to eat it, even if you're full.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By necessity, we omitted any shops specialising in Korean fried chicken - there are just too many of them. We also couldn't include the fried chicken I eat at most frequently - Popeye's - because the only branch in Hong Kong is in the restricted area of Chek Lap Kok airport.

We ended up asking a manager, who told us that we could buy just chicken. Single pieces (thighs or drumsticks) cost HK$17, and come with a small cup of gravy, which we didn't taste.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This was by far our favourite of the day. We each had a thigh, and the coating was a bit thick, but it was crunchy, flavourful and not oily. The chicken was served piping hot and the meat was moist, tender, and not too salty. The thigh came with the back attached, which means you get a bite of chicken tail, as well as the “oyster” - the small nugget of meat that comes nestled in the lower back of the bird.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hot Star Large Fried Chicken</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fried chicken is a popular choice at night markets in Taiwan. Some places - including Taiwanese chain, Hot Star - offer different chicken parts - including legs, wings and nuggets. But “large fried chicken” is different: it's the boneless breast meat, pounded thin before it's breaded and fried. So far, so ordinary. What sets it apart is that instead of being cut into manageable pieces, large fried chicken is served whole, the argument being that if it's cut up, the meat will be less juicy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hot Star double-fries its chicken; the glass-fronted kitchen shows an array of precooked meat. After the customer places the order, the chicken is fried again to heat it and crisp the crust, before it's dusted with a mix of white pepper, five-spice and other seasonings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I usually dislike chicken breast, but when served like this, it's delicious (at least when fresh; leftovers eaten the next day were as dry as you'd expect white meat to be). We ordered “the original” (the other option was “hot”) and the seasoning was mildly spicy, while the coating was delicately crunchy.</span></p>

It was also the only place where the food was brought to us by a waitress, rather than being self-service. The food also came garnished, with a hush puppy (fried cornmeal) and pickled, very spicy vegetables.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chicken could have been blotted better: there was a puddle of oil underneath the pieces. My first bite wasn't promising - although the skin was crunchy, the thigh meat was stringy. But I took a bite from the other side of the bone, and the meat was much better - tender and well seasoned. The pickled vegetables did a good job of cleansing the palate.</span></p>

We took a few minutes to photograph the chicken wings (the only option other than chicken McNuggets), but that shouldn't have made such a difference to the quality; the coating was less crisp than usual, and the meat was tepid. I like the coating, although it's a bit salty - it has a mild spiciness that leaves the tongue tingling.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dai Wei, a 55-year-old retired worker whose main responsibility is taking care of her grandson, has suddenly been thrust into the spotlight of China's latest internet trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With no job, no spending money to speak of and only one year's experience using a smartphone, Dai, who lives in a small county in northern China's Hebei province, is being courted by some of China's hottest internet start-ups, even one-upping her tech-savvy daughter in Beijing by becoming an early adopter of two trendy new apps.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese news app Qutoutiao has been giving Dai small cash rebates to encourage her to browse its lowbrow comedy videos and social news content, while social e-commerce app Pinduoduo is offering heavily discounted and even free goods if she finds more than five friends or family members to take part in the </span><span class="s3">Groupon</span><span class="s1">-style online purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The marketing promotions signal a new wave in China's rapidly evolving internet landscape, in which the so-called diaosi - the Chinese equivalent of country bumpkins - are now sought after as spending by higher income, tech-savvy urban residents has levelled off after years of rapid growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is easier to get into Goldman Sachs than be hired for this job at Chinese e-commerce giant[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2131628/it-easier-get-goldman-sachs-be-hired-job-chinese-e-commerce-giant]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With 772 million online users at the end of 2017, China's internet population is bigger than that of India and the US combined.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While many of these are young, well-educated urbanites accustomed to swiping their smartphones to pay for dinner or shopping online to buy imported cherries from Chile, almost half the Chinese population remains unconnected to the internet, meaning diaosi are a new target group potentially worth billions of dollars for any successful internet business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rest of the world, including wealthier parts of China, have been talking about a consumption upgrade, but for the [lower tier cities] which have massive market potential, cheapness is always attractive and is largely what appeals to those consumers,” said Jay Liu, senior manager at CKGSB Chuang Community, an accelerator for Chinese start-ups, including Pinduoduo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/01/5ea8a562-4945-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_112513.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it may be common for middle-class families in Shanghai to enjoy overseas holidays at least once a year and office workers in Beijing to spend more than 10,000 yuan (U$1,583) on a Gucci handbag, data from </span><span class="s3">China's National Bureau of Statistics</span><span class="s1"> shows that the country's per capita disposable income was 25,974 yuan last year, dropping to 13,432 yuan in rural areas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's internet majors, including its top two e-commerce players </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, have launched a string of initiatives to try to get into smaller cities, from on the ground market education to drone-enabled delivery services in mountainous areas. Start-ups such as Pinduoduo and Qutoutiao have built a marketing strategy from the very start to specifically target lower tier cities. Alibaba is the parent company of theSouth China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest in China's online shopping scene is the US$3 shop[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2137771/latest-chinas-online-shopping-scene-3-shop]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By directly connecting China's domestic manufacturers to shoppers, Shanghai Xunmeng Information Technology has developed its Pinduoduo e-commerce platform into one of the fastest growing companies in China, reaching 156 million monthly active users within its first two-and-a-half years, according to QuestMobile. In comparison, monthly active users for </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba were 226 million and 515 million respectively at the end of 2017 after nearly 20 years of development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most fourth-tier and village consumers have never driven a car. They have never owned a passport. They get their entertainment from smartphones, not from going to the movies or taking trips,” said Jeffrey Towson, a Peking University professor who specialises in Chinese consumers and the digital economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[They] are more frugal and value focused and are not as brand conscious or loyal, and for them word of mouth is still the most important form of advertising,” said Towson, who is the author ofThe One Hour China Consumer Book.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's young consumers don't just want to shop online - they want to be entertained while doing it[http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2142934/chinas-young-consumers-dont-just-want-shop-online-they-want-be]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the Pinduoduo app, Dai has snapped up bargains by joining together with friends and family, including a bedsheet priced at 19.9 yuan and a 39 yuan down jacket, both of which were delivered free to her doorstep.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qutoutiao, which translates as “interesting headlines,” said about 80 per cent of its more than 10 million daily active users live in third-tier cities, about 70 per cent of its readers are women, and 35 per cent of those are aged over 40.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai-based company, founded in June 2016, said it sees promising business potential for the underserved demand for such news in tier three cities. The strategy has already paid off, with thestart-up recently reaching unicorn status after a US$200 million funding round led by Chinese internet giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/01/198f29c4-4945-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_112513.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides using sensational news to keep viewers around, Qutoutiao runs a reward programme - paying about one-tenth of a yuan per user per day - to encourage readers stay on the app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dai has accumulated more than 10 yuan of reward money in her Qutoutiao account - half the cost of another bedsheet from Pinduoduo - though she says the money is not the only reason she keeps using the app.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qutoutiao declined to make an executive available for an interview on its marketing strategy but provided an emailed response: “China's internet market is highly competitive. In ride-hailing, food delivery and e-commerce, many companies offer customer subsidies to succeed in business. We are no different. Compared with spending a lot of money on advertising, why not just give the money to our users?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the success of Pinduoduo and Qutoutiao they have come under fire, with Chinese media accusing them of taking advantage of people with lower incomes and education levels. Some media commentators have labelled the companies as examples of “consumption degrade”, accusing Pinduoduo of providing poor-quality goods and Qutoutiao of feeding people content in poor taste.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pinduoduo received about 15 per cent of all complaints among the 10 major Chinese e-commerce sites monitored in 2017, second after Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao platforms, according to Hangzhou-based internet consultancy China E-Commerce Research Centre. Most of the complaints were related to product quality.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pinduoduo has not responded to numerous queries sent by thePost over the past two weeks about the quality issue. But its chief executive Huang Zheng denied that the company's core competence was “cheapness” in an interview with Chinese business news magazine Caijing in early April. “Only traditional companies divide people by using the standard of tier one or tier two. We want to satisfy the different demands of every person. One can shop for a Hermes handbag but still buy a 9.9 yuan box of mangoes from our site,” he was quoted as saying in the Caijing report.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statement from Qutoutiao pushed back on any perception that its content was lowbrow. “Media or people in tier-one and tier-two cities are using the word ‘lowbrow' to describe us and in reading behaviours of those in smaller cities. We are strongly against vulgar content. It is just that there is different demand for content between those in small towns and mega cities,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The past several weeks have seen an ongoing crackdown by the Chinese government on “inappropriate” online media, which included an order foronline news aggregator Jinri Toutiao to shut down a short video joke site that was deemed vulgar[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2141312/chinas-king-titillating-content-issues-apology-providing-what-people], with the company pledging to hire more staff to monitor content.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far there are no indications the censorship crackdown has affected Qutoutiao, even though it has a similar content strategy as Toutiou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Sujie, the 30-year-old daughter of Hebei grandmother Dai, said she used to think the Pinduoduo shopping links her mother posted via </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> were tactics to trick the elderly into making purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The design of the user interface on Pinduoduo looks quite low-end and the products on sale look so cheap, but after I tried it I think it is an ideal place to buy necessities, such as dishclothes and garbage bags,” Li said. “As long as they can provide good-quality basic products, I can shop there from time to time.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stands out as the preferred market for raising capital among China's most valuable companies, according to a survey that vindicates last year's overhaul in the city's stock listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four out of every 10 so-called unicorns[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2110209/who-has-most-unicorns-china-or-us] identified Hong Kong as the preferred market for an initial public offering (IPO), according to a </span><span class="s3">PricewaterhouseCooper</span><span class="s1"> survey of 101 of these companies, each with at least US$1 billion in valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US stock markets come in second at 25 per cent, followed by China's yuan-denominated A-share market in third place with 23 per cent, according to the survey of C-suite executives including founders and chairmen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is the preferred capital market partly due to the latest tweaks in its listing measures, including the support for biotechnology companies and dual-class structures, reflecting the determination to embrace the new economy by the stock exchange,” said Gao Jianbin, PwC's leader for China technology, media and telecommunications leader, in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey is the latest vindication for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which last year pushed through a controversial overhaul of the city's listing regulations along with the securities regulator. The amendments, the most extensive in three decades, were to help the bourse regain its pole position as the world's largest market for fundraising, after losing the 2017 crown to New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>

The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">is also rolling out a class of Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) to allow domestic investors to partake in the offshore listings of Chinese companies, opening up an additional avenue to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, some unicorns will wait and see the results of real listings before making the decision to jump into the CDR fray, Gao said. Xiaomi, which was supposed to be the pioneer for the CDR programme, last week postponed its CDR plan, marking a setback for the Chinese government's overtures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Questions remain as countdown begins on depositary receipts with Chinese characteristics[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2151293/questions-remain-countdown-begins-depositary-receipts-chinese]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also enjoys the advantage of being an established capital market and global financial centre, complete with transparent and predictable procedures and rule of law, Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey found that 64 per cent of the companies have a listing plan in the next two years and 21 per cent called it an urgent task. About 75 per cent of the respondents have been running business for less than eight years while the remaining ones have been in operation within four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the survey, unicorn companies listed talents drainage and disruption on capital chain as the two biggest potential challenges or crisis they are concerned about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is itself a publicly listed company, its stock rising by almost 19 per cent in the past 12 months.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market value of China's US$7.8 trillion stock market is likely to grow 6 per cent if policymakers succeed in wooing the country's unicorns, or start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion, to list their shares on the domestic bourses. The world's second-largest economy is home to an estimated 120 of these companies with a combined valuation of 3 trillion yuan (US$473 billion), according to brokerage data. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, backed by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, is ranked top, followed by </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Xiaomi. China's stringent listing rules on profitability track record have prompted the likes of Alibaba, Tencent Holdings and Baidu to seek listings in either the United States or Hong Kong. In view of the country's fast-growing technology industries, regulators are now ready to ease the regulations. This month, the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said a major revision would be held for the listing rules this year to clear the hurdles facing share sales by new economy companies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is the most advanced digital society in the world? America? Britain? Or Germany? No. The answer is a small little-known country in Europe, Estonia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, Estonia has grabbed a lot of attentions worldwide in recent years, especially after its innovative - perhaps also a little bit controversial to some - digital citizenship initiative to allow everyone in the world has the potential to virtually become an Estonian so people can set up business online more easily, in particular for market entry in Europe Union, of which Estonia is a member nation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For those who study the new type of governance, Estonia is often cited as a showcase example in academic papers about what the so-called "e-government" should be like. This concept is no stranger to Hong Kong officials as Hong Kong has been pushing for "e-government" for many years but little progress has been really proved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A former Hong Kong official told me about fifteen years ago some Estonian officials said in a conference that the vision for the Estonian government was to become the "Hong Kong in Europe", referring to Hong Kong's highly competitive advantages on world stage including low tax, rule of law, efficient business environment, and effective governance at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I was in Estonia for a short trip last week. As a traveller, I was quickly impressed by Estonia's internet and technology-friendly environment in almost every possible aspect. You can of course use your credit card to pay for your taxi fare, which you cannot do in Hong Kong and apparently the government has so far got no idea about how to fix this problem after so many years of discussions in the public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All government-owned facilities from port to museums provide free Wi-fi and I would like to rank Estonia's free Wi-fi also as one of the fastest and most stable public Wi-fi in the world (trust me; I do travel a lot). Private sectors are also supportive to the government's pro-internet policy by providing Wi-fi access to everyone almost everywhere, from local restaurants to shopping malls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You may argue free Wi-fi is such a small thing but I view this a clear and great attitude on how the government view how important for the country and its people to stay connected with the world anytime. After you visit Estonia and feel the openness of the society, you won't be surprised why Estonia is the birthplace of Skype, now a real-time multimedia messaging product owned by </span><span class="s3">Microsoft</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week at SLUSH, Europe's largest start-up conference in Finland where the Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a journalist-turned-politician, gave his speech - also a sort of complaint - about how </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> should catch up with the fast-changing era of Internet to make it more open and adaptable to all the changes. Estonia also set up a booth at the event where its slogan was loud and clear - come to Estonia and this will be where the next "unicorns" are born. Unicorn is a jargon the technology space to describe those new start-ups that quickly get their valuations beyond US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I'm not sure if Estonia still keeps its vision to be the "Hong Kong in Europe" or it already expects something bigger. But for Hong Kong, what lessons can we learn from the fast rise of a small but now important country like Estonia on world stage?</span></p>
