<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company, also known as Ping An Good Doctor, has launched its highly anticipated Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) which aims to raise as much as HK$8.77 billion (US$1.12 billion) in what could become the city's biggest flotation by an internet-based business since ZhongAn Online's blockbuster IPO last September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing, which has already triggered an increase in Hong Kong's liquidity demand, is expected to ignite investor enthusiasm and become the catalyst for a strong potential pipeline of blockbuster new-economy IPOs this year, including star names such as Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed tech listing rule changes, set to be revealed on Tuesday, are also expected to facilitate a rash of dual-class share listings by tech and biotech companies that have yet to make profits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to use the [IPO] proceeds to expand our business, and fund future domestic and overseas acquisitions,” said Wang Tao, the medical service app's chairman and chief executive officer, on Sunday in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company plans to sell 160.094 million shares at an indicative price range of HK$50.8-$54.8 (US$6.48-6.99) per share, raising between HK$8.13 billion and HK$8.77 billion - which would be the city's most valuable this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If priced at the top, it could also become the largest flotation by an internet business since ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance raised HK$11.9 billion last September, in Hong Kong's biggest fintech listing ever.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/23/b779b118-462a-11e8-ab09-36e8e67fb996_image_hires_114409.jpg] Retail investors will be offered 6.5 per cent, or 10.4 million shares, with the rest targeted at international institutional investors, who have shown an “enthusiastic” response, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmond Hui, chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Bright Smart Securities, also expects the stock to receive a hot response from the public, given its “new economy” nature.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will reignite investor enthusiasm for IPOs, as the market anticipates more [new economy listings] to come,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail proportion will be offered from Monday to Thursday, with shares expected to start trading on the main exchange on May 4.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Hong Kong brokerages have already allowed retail investors to pre-register bids for the new stock using margin loans, including Bright Smart Securities, </span><span class="s3">Haitong International</span><span class="s1">, Phillip Securities, Prudential Brokerage, and Celestial Asia Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far, they have received pre-registrations worth some HK$63 billion, according to information available from the firms, reflecting a possible oversubscription of more than 100 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spin-off of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, Good Doctor is currently China's largest online health care and medical platform by user numbers. At the end of 2017, it had 193 million registered users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company posted a 2017 loss of 1 billion yuan (US$158.86 million), its third annual loss, but Lee Yuansiong, deputy chief executive officer for </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, said that is normal for a tech “unicorn” in its early phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Unicorns usually have four phases - building scenarios, obtaining traffic, generating revenue, and generating profit,” Lee said. “Good Doctor is still in the obtaining users and traffic phase.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group and Good Doctor will cooperate closely on businesses in future and that he was optimistic on the latter's outlook.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An's Good Doctor app is using AI to get smarter as its user base tops 180 million[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2121339/ping-ans-medical-app-good-doctor-ramp-reliance-ai-user-base-tops]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through its in-house medical team and partnerships with external hospitals and pharmacy outlets, Good Doctor offers four major online services - family doctors, consumer health care, health management and wellness interaction - as well as an online health mall where shoppers can buy medicine and medical devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seven cornerstone investors will put a combined HK$4.32 billion into the float: </span><span class="s3">BlackRock</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Capital Research and Management Company</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Singapore government</span><span class="s1">'s investment fund GIC Private, </span><span class="s3">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span><span class="s1">, Pantai Juara Investments, which is wholly owned by the Malaysian government's investment fund, CT Bright Holdings, an investment unit of Thailand's conglomerate CP Pokphand, and </span><span class="s3">Swiss Re</span><span class="s1"> Direct Investments Company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citi Group and </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> are acting as the joint sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the prospectus, around 40 per cent of the net proceeds will be used for business expansion, such as its e-commerce business, hiring sales and medical professionals, acquiring new users and funding marketing activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just under a third will be allocated to funding potential investments or acquisitions at home and abroad, a fifth will go on research and development, while the rest will be for working capital and general corporate purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has been dubbed the father of Hong Kong design, and 80-year-old Henry Steiner's works are all around us, including some of the banknotes in our wallets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides many famous logos, including those of </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Jockey Club</span><span class="s1">, Wellcome, Hongkong Land and Lane Crawford, he has designed the banknotes issued by </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1"> since late 1979, after earlier designing notes for </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong allows the three note-issuing banks - </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong) - </span><span class="s1">to appoint the designers for their notes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Watch:?Hong Kong graphic designer Henry Steiner reveals the secret behind our banknotes?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Steiner was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1934 and moved to New York with his parents to escape Nazi persecution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He came to Hong Kong in 1961 to work for a magazine on a nine-month contract but fell in love with the city. He stayed and developed his career here for 54 years, also marrying and having two sons.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Steiner initially studied painting but later shifted to design, which he said was a better fit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A painter tries to solve his own problems while a designer tries to solve the clients' problems," he said. "I kind of like to help other people solve their problems, so design suited me better."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Steiner said the process of designing a banknote was no different from other corporate design work, with the first step being to talk with the bank's top executives to know what message they wanted to send out through the banknotes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They generally would like to have their corporate image as well as the image of Hong Kong and its culture reflected in the banknote's design," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When he designed </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">'s banknotes in 1973, he introduced the iconic image of the bronze lion statues, something other designers have since followed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> banknote designs have been updated several times but have always featured five animals from Chinese mythology, a theme he is very proud of, believing they add character to the banknotes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a clear hierarchy. The more important the note, the more important the animal. There is a fish on the HK$20 note, a turtle on the HK$50, a chi lin (unicorn) on the HK$100, a phoenix on the HK$500 and a dragon on the HK$1,000 note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, people should remember the Chinese legend that when a fish jumps over the gate, it becomes a dragon. I like all my banknote designs, but I like the HK$20 fish the most as the fish could become a dragon one day," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reverse side of the current series of banknotes features a theme combining Chinese heritage with new technology, which Steiner said showed Hong Kong as a city where East meets West.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2009, Steiner also designed a special HK$150 banknote issued to celebrate </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">'s 150th anniversary in Hong Kong. That note did not feature an animal, but instead a mix of people representing the city.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an episode of American television show Mad Men, one of the copywriters, while stoned, has the best idea for an advertising campaign ever - whereupon he proceeds to celebrate his achievement with lots of brandy. The next morning, waking up half-dead in his office, he remembers he had a fantastic idea but has forgotten - completely and forever - what it was.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The three artists of the Yangjiang Group need have no fear of suffering a similar loss. Instead of forgetting their bright ideas while sozzled, they get drunk with the specific intention of thinking them up. And the words they splash with inebriated hands all over the canvas aren't notes to refer to later - they are the art.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's Easter and we have descended on Yangjiang, a "tiny" city of "only" two million people or so in southwestern Guangdong province. A four-hour bus trip from Zhuhai, this brand new town is home to Zheng Guogu (Zheng National Valley), Sun Qinglin (Sun Celebrate Unicorn) and Chen Zaiyan (Chen Again Scorching).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My travel companion and I have heard they do drunken calligraphy and installation art with a twist - yes, even in the often bizarre world of installation art, getting friends to write out all the words of Das Kapital in Chinese characters on 7,000 loose pieces of paper, then filling a stadium with these while a football tournament involving six teams is being played, counts as "a twist" - but we don't know anything else about the three.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We expect them to be a bunch of mildly subversive, acutely suffering artists in their mid- to late twenties, subsisting on scraps, living with their parents and surfacing briefly, on the odd occasion they are sober, to thrash out ideas for the next bacchanalia on a Formica-topped table with deep cigarette burns, before getting sloshed again on the cheapest of rice wine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We picture them as having asymmetrically cut hair, if any, perhaps with that awful bane of male humanity: a goatee. We imagine them dressed in black polo-neck jumpers and wearing large black-rimmed glasses, wafting about androgynously and wand-like.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What we get, though, is three - well, geezers, quite frankly, ranging from 36 to 43 years old, chain-smoking and dark of tooth. The only thing that hints at "artist" is a tuft of hair on the back of Zheng's head, dyed a rusty orange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, they look more like bus uncles or vaguely criminal construction site foremen, or maybe low-ranking government officials on an outing, than anything connected with the creative arts. But, then again, theirs is very far removed from what we normally think of as art.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When Zheng picks us up at the hotel to go to the heung ha (ancestral village or countryside) for dinner and a chat, we receive more proof that our preconceptions - or rather, prejudices - are misplaced. His car is an enormous roaring four-wheel-drive beast with the word "JEEP" emblazoned on the bonnet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All right, so maybe they're not poor, either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over dinner at a red-brick shack far away from town, Zheng tells us that instead of being a wild, constantly drunk madman, he is now a teetotaller. He stopped drinking two years ago, after a nasty shock. First he got paralytic, dashing off some well-executed art before driving home. On the way, he crashed into another car head on, sending its driver and passenger to hospital. His own car was completely wrecked but Zheng staggered away unscathed, to wake up in his own bed blissfully unaware of what had taken place. One must assume, however, that he would have had something of a headache.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When told what had happened, and after paying 16,000 yuan (HK$19,600) for his victims' hospital bills, Zheng reckoned it was God who had saved him that night, and that He might not be so benevolent next time. It was time to give up drinking.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sobriety has clearly done him no harm, though. Over the three days we spend with Zheng, with the other two group members drifting in and out of the various places we visit, his output of original art is incredibly high. The sheer volume would just not be possible to produce for someone continuously engaged in getting drunk and/or nursing a hangover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun and Chen, however, are still doing the drunken calligraphy thing with a vengeance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio, who started the Yangjiang Group in 2001, came to calligraphy by vastly different routes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The brooding, intense Zheng, who is actually quite wand-like after having lost 30 pounds from just not drinking beer any more, became a calligrapher as an act of revenge. His teacher in primary school set about him for writing characters the wrong way, making the rebellious or possibly dyslexic Zheng copy each character 100 times until he got it right. He never did, and the teacher washed his weary hands of him, declaring that the boy would never amount to anything.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zheng set out to prove that, in a country where the highest form of art is to slavishly copy one master or another in calligraphy as well as other ink media, there is no "right" way to write Chinese characters - the only thing that counts is self-expression.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jovial but quiet, Chen, the most uncle-looking of the three - who is a married father of one - learned art the "normal" way: by studying classical calligraphy at Guangzhou University of Fine Arts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As unlikely as it sounds, the self-possessed, soulful-looking Sun learnt calligraphy from an illiterate relative. The relation, an ironsmith, had no work coming in before one Lunar New Year and grew worried about money. He noticed a neighbour, a writer of calligraphy for New Year door couplets and wedding cards, had more work than he could cope with. "I can do that," the enterprising man thought, and started copying his neighbour's art, without being able to read a single word.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is it really possible to get Chinese characters down like that without practising for years and years, and without knowing what they mean?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun assures me it is indeed possible, especially if you trace the characters. But even if the story isn't true, it underscores the very core of the group's world-view: that anybody can write calligraphy; that, contrary to popular belief, there are no rules; and that a market vendor describing what he's got on his stall and how much each item costs (a frequent topic at their exhibitions) is just as much calligraphy art as a perfect copy of a scroll of some dead master.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When you look at their art, or just their calligraphy, or syu fat (shu fa), as they prefer to call it, it is obvious that, despite the characters' ostensible illegibility, they are written by people who know what they are doing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The group base their calligraphy on current affairs, especially football, reading newspaper stories and then writing their reactions to them while drunk (or not, in Zheng's case). Waking up in the morning - or rather the next evening after drinking/working all night and sleeping all day - they are often surprised to find they have produced large canvases of work and also covered every other surface, including their cars, in calligraphy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After dinner, what few suffering-artist preconceptions we still have are quickly put to rest. The group's main studio is a massive "iceberg" set in a traditional garden - Zheng's design - for which he has had to fork out a small fortune to placate the local council and his neighbours. It is a very affluent neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The inside of the building can best be described as cavernous - an open space three storeys high with a winding staircase in the middle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the roof is something that at first glance looks like a classical garden, complete with rocks and a carp pond. On closer inspection, the "rocks" are revealed to be sacks of cement artfully arranged to look like natural formations. Here the group displays its large canvases: stunning, paint-dripping things, which, if you look closely and can read Chinese, are indeed calligraphy, shot through with the odd English word. There is black on yellow, yellow on black and black on white; swirling, unreadable characters in various bold colours, creating a Jackson Pollock-like effect of seeming effortlessness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Well, when I say "unreadable", I mean, of course, "unreadable for me". Looking at the yellow-on-black canvas, I recognise only two characters: those that make up the word "urine".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One canvas - or mural, really - is mounted above a large gnarled tree trunk of the style so beloved by tea ceremony masters. And it soon becomes depressingly apparent: instead of getting drunk with the Yangjiang Group and seeing them in full splash, cranking out calligraphy, we are going to be treated to gallons and gallons of tea. (But at least it's Iron Buddha and of excellent quality, even I know that).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why do they want to spend so much time with us, we wonder? We conclude that few other journalists have been here, to far-away Yangjiang, to see these drunken artists. No, almost none have visited. Other than a number from all corners of China, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Italy and … oh, Austria and Belgium. Apart from them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And have they ever exhibited outside of Yangjiang, maybe in Guangzhou? No, hardly anywhere; just London, Liverpool, various places in Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden, Australia, the US …</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It turns out the Yangjiang Group are megastars on the arts circuit. We stand corrected, and not a little chastised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next day, after a terribly, terribly early, almost beer-less night, Zheng picks us up in his roaring vehicle, which looks like it should be thundering across some African savannah looking for lions, not put-putting sedately around the fascistically manicured, nouveau-riche streets of Yangjiang, to take us to his house, or rather, flat.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zheng's flat is on the fifth floor of a walk-up and … there the similarity to any apartment I've ever been to in the mainland, or anywhere else, ends. It is several flats combined into one. A winding staircase goes up to the roof, which has three sitting areas (the use of which follows fung shui principles) and a collection of large carp, swimming around the intricately laid-out borders of the roof.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inside is a large studio, where Zheng's assistant struggles to keep up with the artist's feverish creativity. For Zheng is about so much more than drunken, now teetotal, writings about football. It seems that everything the man touches turns to art. Here are beer cans and shampoo bottles made of bronze and copper, enormous canvases based on photographs and turned into upholstered fabric - the largest shows one of his installation happenings: the digging up of a 10-metre-high tree and its journey from Tianjin to Beijing - as well as bread covered in wax and made to look like a decorative rock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At first glance, the furniture looks as though it's of the traditional hardwood variety, but it turns out to be full of thousands of little holes - Zheng says it takes him about six months to "moonscape" a whole chair. A large piece of red fabric embroidered with streaks of yellow, blue, purple and white is in fact drunken calligraphy that has been run through the computer and turned into cloth in a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A long tea ceremony follows (Zheng's flat has at least two large tree trunks for this purpose) before - so help me God - there is yet another art-filled place to see.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This one is in the countryside, and is the kind of place that evokes only one reaction: gobsmacked. My companion starts mumbling about "megalomania" but I don't know; when each canvas measures several square metres and many of the installations include office furniture, sofas and trees covered in dripping wax, it seems obvious that you need a lot of space. Included here are, naturally, a large carp pond, a separate building just for dinner and a towering skeleton of concrete, which in the future will be an exhibition space. Oh, and there's a brook with imported boulders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Small wonder the group isn't interested in moving to Shanghai, Beijing or even Guangzhou - it owns large chunks of Yangjiang and its environs. Zheng indicates that the bribes, sorry, "tea money", he has had to fork out to buy the flats and all this land, as well as placating the neighbours of his monster iceberg building, runs into the hundreds of thousands of yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Which leads us to the question: who buys these canvases and installations? The group is surprisingly cagey about this, either changing the topic or mumbling that we should ask their "handlers": Guangzhou-based Vitamin Creative Space (although I doubt that, with Zheng's obvious fierce independence, he will let himself be handled by anything or anybody).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I do ask them, but they don't answer e-mails in Chinese nor English. It is all very mysterious - the group can tell me how much they have to bribe people to put up a building or ten, but not where the money comes from. Perhaps they've done well from wagers, because, as well as football, the group has a keen interest in gambling, writing about it in large, rambling characters on canvas - using a billiard cue. Or chopsticks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here is an extract from Sun's The Gambling Ring Made for the Director of International Football Association (two by five metres, paint on canvas with chopstick): "The most vulgar description I have ever heard of football is as follows: 'The football is like a 16-year-old girl, rolling around and being publicly [raped] on a field by 22 men, then she is pulled into five-star hotel rooms by greasy, gluttonous politicians for private raping and last she has to serve as the object of [gratification] for billions of fans and gamblers.' How can one poor little girl take this much sexual assault?"</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pretty articulate for an evening spent drunk out of your skull; what's more, many of the words on this canvas are legible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next morning, I take a walk around Yangjiang, a city that seemingly sprang forth, fully formed, in 2010 or thereabouts. There are huge empty spaces decorated with lampposts, man-made lakes, China-style skyscraper residential buildings - all concrete, tiles and metal. It is soulless, spiritless and colourless. It is difficult to imagine a place like this fostering three such incredibly creative forces.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I ask Zheng what inspires him. What made him the creativity-on-steroids machine that he is today?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He replies (albeit cagily) that even as a child, he would make his little room something special and that the design thing, although he studied at the Yangzhou School of Fine Arts, had always been with him. He, like Yangjiang, seemingly sprang forth ready-made.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When I return to the studio, it immediately becomes clear where that creativity came from. Even in the garden surrounding the iceberg I can hear it: wonderful traditional music cascading out, bouncing off the calligraphy-festooned walls. And there in the cavernous reception hall of the Yangjiang Group's studio, which is also a concert hall/working space/tea rooms/cyber cafe/photography studio/hang-out space and God knows what else, sit Zheng's 60-something father and two other elderly gentlemen, churning out beautiful and incredibly loud tunes, some of which I recognise from my collection of traditional Chinese music. But the instruments are not exactly traditional.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zheng's father is plucking a small, bright blue electric guitar with built-in amplifier - which he built from scratch. A-ha - so it is genetic. The erhu (a two-stringed instrument) being played is also electric, complete with amplifier. And as if those two aren't generating music that is loud enough, the third instrument in this very traditional Chinese ensemble is … a saxophone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is the Yangjiang Group and everything around them in a nutshell. They take tradition, everyday life and people's conceptions about - oh, everything - turn them upside down and shake them vigorously. Before covering them in wax.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Yangjiang Group will exhibit with Vitamin Creative Space at ArtHK 12, which begins on Thursday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like all the best ideas, it started with a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Steven Lam Hoi-yuen - the man who would go on to co-found Hong Kong's first US$1 billion start-up - that problem was the difficulty of trying to find delivery vans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The year was 2010, and a young Lam was trying to launch his first business venture - a company selling advertisements on food takeout boxes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He and his two co-founders quickly discovered it was nigh on impossible to arrange vans that could transport the takeout boxes to the restaurants, as the call centres they were phoning often did not pick up or claimed they did not have vans available.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio had to ring multiple call centres with different pools of drivers to find available vans. They soon realised that each call centre had a limited number of drivers registered with them, even though there were many available vans parked in the streets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From this logistical challenge sprang the concept for GoGoVan, the on-demand van hire service that this week announced a merger with China's 58 Suyun to create Asia's largest online intra-city logistics and freight service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Most successful businesses start off with a problem to solve. If the problem is big enough, it helps them become a much bigger company," Lam, 31, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post on Wednesday. "To us, [GoGoVan] is something we love, that's why we continued doing it."There is never a best time to start something, you can never wait for enough resources to start something. Don't wait to do something, use your own hands and [go prove it]Steven Lam, co-founder, GoGoVan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was while working part-time as a food delivery man for a Chinese restaurant that Lam had struck upon his idea of selling adverts on takeaway boxes, which tend to be unbranded and plain. He had just returned to Hong Kong after graduating in the US and, unable to find a suitable job amid the sky-high unemployment that followed the financial crisis, established a company with co-founders Nick Tang Kuen-wai and Reeve Kwan Chun-man to put the idea into action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trio lost none of their ambition as the years passed, choosing to pour their savings into starting a logistics business as their friends squirrelled money away to buy a flat in the world's most expensive property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike most of his peers, owning an apartment was never part of Lam's game plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If your dream is to buy a house, then at the end of the day all you have is a house," said Lam, also GoGoVan's chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"At the end of the day the story that I want to tell my grandchildren is not that I could buy a house, but that I did something great, something game-changing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, GoGoVan enjoys the honour of being Hong Kong's first "unicorn" start-up, with an estimated valuation of over US$1 billion after its merger with 58 Suyun, the freight business of mainland Chinese online classifieds giant </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan to become Hong Kong's first US$1 billion start-up after merger with 58 Suyun[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2108658/gogovan-become-hong-kongs-first-us1-billion-start-after-merger-58]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan and 58 Suyun plan to expand in mainland China and Southeast Asia after merging, aiming to become the number one intra-city logistics platform in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam will be chief executive of the merged company, which wants to extend its reach to 200 more Chinese cities and step into more Southeast Asian markets in the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's all a far cry from the van-hailing app's humble beginnings in 2013, and Lam admits he could never have dreamed of this level of success.At the end of the day the story that I want to tell my grandchildren is not that I could buy a house, but that I did something great, something game-changingSteven Lam, GoGoVan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He helped establish GoGoVan with a mere HK$20,000 (US$2,556) in initial capital. He put his savings into the start-up because he believed in the company, and subsisted on HK$20 meals from </span><span class="s3">McDonald's</span><span class="s1"> every dayas he and his co-founders tried to get the company off the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We rented a small room in an old industrial building which could barely sit three to four people, and the elevator broke down every other day," Lam said. "We ran out of cash in two months."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan's change of fortunes eventually came when it attracted investment from New Horizon Capital, Singapore Press Holdings and the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, a non-profit initiative run by the e-commerce juggernaut. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam's own beginnings were as humble as the company's.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Born into a low-income family, he grew up on a public housing estate in Kowloon, where he still lives today. After dropping out of high school in Hong Kong in 2005, he moved to the United States at a relative's invitation in order to study at a community college in California.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He eventually excelled and gained admission into the prestigious </span><span class="s3">University of California, Berkeley</span><span class="s1">, as a business major. To afford the university's costly tuition and support himself, Lam dabbled in different businesses, teaching himself to fix iPhones, bicycles and even sell electronics on </span><span class="s3">eBay</span><span class="s1">. At one point, he sold hot dogs to make ends meet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">" width="660" height="385" data-resolution="2" src="https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/31/1391aca8-8de4-11e7-9f40-4d9615941c08_1320x770_094031.JPG[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/31/1391aca8-8de4-11e7-9f40-4d9615941c08_1320x770_094031.JPG]" class="caption"&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At a press conference on Tuesday announcing the merger between 58 Suyun and GoGoVan, Lam urged reporters to broaden the discussion to entrepreneurship in Hong Kong rather than fixating on property, after a reporter asked Lam when he planned to buy a house.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think there's any problems with wanting to buy a house, since everyone needs to live somewhere," Lam told the Post. "But I don't want reporters talking about GoGoVan's merger and then [asking me if i will buy] property. I want to talk about how we can make this brand from Hong Kong great."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he did admit the fixation of Hongkongers on getting a foot on the exorbitantly expensive property ladder had a knock-on effect on his efforts to launch GoGoVan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I wanted to borrow money from friends to start the company but they were saving up to buy flats," said Lam. "They said that if I failed, they will lose their homes. It was very difficult for me to borrow any money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In our society, getting a [stable] job and buying a house is too deeply rooted in our thinking. When our generation is fighting for a place to stay or to make enough to meet our basic needs, there is no room for them to be [innovative], it's a huge problem," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While home ownership is traditionally held up as an important priority by Hongkongers, the city's young people are struggling to realise this dream with property prices at an all-time high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 27 per cent of people aged 18 to 24 intended to buy a flat, down from 55 per cent in 2006, a survey of 800 respondents by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups</span><span class="s1"> found last November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That compares with 91 per cent of mainland millennials intending to buy homes over the next five years, 80 per cent in the United States and 74 per cent in Britain, a study by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> found in February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Lam's advice for young, ambitious people in his home city is rooted not in the realms of real estate, but in what he knows best - innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He urged Hongkongers who have a dream of starting a company to pursue that goal, and not to wait for the best time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is never a best time to start something, you can never wait for enough resources to start something. You will always think you need more. Don't wait to do something, use your own hands and [go prove it.]"</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We live in a world where attention has become the most valuable commodity. To what extent do we control what occupies our attention? Apple, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and Tesla are no longer simply device, search, social media or car companies. Their core asset has become the data they gather on us. Their products we know and love are harvesting information 24/7.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are recording what we look up, where we go, who we look up, how we get there, when we wake up and go to bed. Ambient computing devices like Google Home and the Apple Watch make their way into our lives as a convenience but are also gathering ever more minute data points on our behaviour and preferences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These devices log how we operate, our habits, what we are afraid to ask others but will ask a search engine incognito. Debate on intent aside, the marketplace we live in seems to often know more about us than we may know about ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average person as of 2014 was exposed to 5,000 advertisements per day - that's 3.5 ads per minute. It's probably much more than that now. Even start-ups that have no revenue model but have the engagement of hundreds of millions of eyeballs can command multibillion-dollar unicorn Snapchat-type valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data will become an ever-increasing driver of the attention economy. Still not convinced?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">•Retargeting, a type of online advertising that displays ads based on web users' previous online behaviour, convinces us that something we looked at yesterday is something we need to buy and follows us around the internet, even onto our tablets and mobile devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">•</span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> tells me when to wish my friends “happy birthday”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">•</span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> informs me when I need to leave for my next meeting to get there on time, and if I should bring an umbrella with me.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">•Snapchat gives me feedback on how “close” I am to my friends via emoji-based rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if you're not on social media, browser cookies are still pulling down information on your preferences and what you're looking at, on a generally anonymous basis. All this should scare us a lot, but it doesn't.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why? Because we're better for it, or at least we think we are. </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> saves me 10 minutes on my route and from getting drenched on the way to work. </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> helps me stay in touch and reconnect with friends I haven't seen in a decade. Tesla will soon get me to work while I sneak in some extra sleep or read the news, and might even allow me to share my car during the day while I'm at the office - to make some residual income or at least share the cost of the vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The data we're creating matters - what we search, what we browse and what we look at feeds algorithms, and marketing that will continue to bombard us thousands of times per day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marketing is shifting from mass marketing to a one-to-many model. While billboards and TV ads are still very much present, segmented marketing - showing people who fit a certain demographic and have a certain propensity or interest in a product, is intuitively much more effective. With the volume of data being gathered on our browsing activity, it won't be long before the shift becomes one-to-one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Imagine a world where each ad you see is tailor-made for you, the things you like to eat, see and buy, maybe even interlaced with a photo of your friends buying the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brave new world or Skynet from Terminator? Perhaps we don't like being told what we want to buy, but what if what we spend hours searching for is something that's been here all along, in our shopping list on </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1"> or Taobao?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There's a perpetual tension between being given the free will to choose what we want and being fed, recommended and suggested what we want. Overwhelmingly, statistics show that we naturally veer towards the latter but innately we like to think we have control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whether it's reality or illusion of control[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2096733/challenges-arise-power-artificial-intelligence], I would advocate that, at the end of the day, we need to be informed - to ingest a diversity of news from multiple channels, to better understand the world and how it's evolving and changing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many media companies, including the South China Morning Post, are using data to bring to readers smarter, more tailored content. While readers' attention is appreciated, our fundamental desire is to ensure readers are informed and able to perceive the world in a more nuanced and smarter way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's an exciting time to be alive and, as China's economy continues to grow to eventually surpass the US in the upcoming decade, staying on top of trends, politics and new developments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and technology will be ever more critical to global awareness.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Glorious Days turned on the power to break his Group One maiden, give trainer John Size his fifth Stewards' Cup in 12 attempts and added another chapter to what is building as one of Hong Kong racing's great rivalries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a race that could not have played out more perfectly if it had been scripted, jockey Douglas Whyte found himself perched behind a group of John Moore's runners who led the field up and broke it into two halves by the middle stages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The way he travels in a race has been transformed by the blinkers. I could have put him anywhere in the race today but I was very happy with where I was - I had four in front of me and the rest behind and Glorious Days was very comfortable," said Whyte later after adding the latest edition of the Stewards' Cup to his wins on Armada for Size in 2007 and in 2012 on Ambitious Dragon, who struggled in his wake yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I thought I gave Glorious Days a great ride in the Hong Kong Mile and Ambitious Dragon was too good on the day, but he did feel very strong on the line today, which he hasn't always been in the past. We've always felt the horse was good enough for these kinds of races, he just hasn't had the mental game until now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the fourth time the pair of top milers had met this season and they have taken turns in winning, though Ambitious Dragon (Zac Purton) shocked punters in finishing out of the placings at odds-on and any dreams of him completing the elusive Triple Crown are now over.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Prior to straightening it was a little bit tight and I had to hold my ground a bit but he was able to go through there and I thought I was still going to win the race," said Purton. "But when I let him go, he just never let down like he has been."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size had won the Stewards' Cup at his first three assaults on it with Electronic Unicorn in 2002 and 2003 and Super Kid in 2004, but had been missing from the winner's dais since Armada six years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The race was run really to suit Glorious Days," he said matter-of-factly. "A fast pace, two sections and he was in the perfect spot trailing the leaders. When the pace is as fast as it was, the backmarkers are left with a lot of ground to make up and that takes the sting out of their finish. Sectionally, it couldn't have set up better."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a breakthrough success at the elite level that didn't surprise Size, who has maintained all season that a trip away to Japan for 2012 Yasuda Kinen was the making of Glorious Days mentally, despite finishing 14th, and he has every intention of targeting the Tokyo race again in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This was his best performance today - it was run so the overall time was quick and he's always promised to deliver a performance like that but he's had the racing now to do it," Size said. "The future is pretty clear, it's all mapped out for these top horses with no options. I don't think he'd run any further than 1,600m but he could come back to 1,400m in the Queen's Silver Jubilee, then go Champions Mile and then the Yasuda Kinen looks an ideal target.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Last year he went there and travelled beautifully, did everything right, so he's already got the experience but I think he'd go back a different horse this time and probably perform a lot better."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">California Memory was an eye-catching third in the Stewards' Cup, ridden somewhat closer than usual, was caught wide behind midfield, and kept coming in the run down the straight for the bravest of thirds that sets him up as the one to beat in next month's Hong Kong Gold Cup at 2,000m.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We didn't want him to have too much to do from the turn, so I tried to have him closer," said jockey Matt Chadwick. "His run was fantastic."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some names of Hong Kong districts, foods and certain ubiquitous Cantonese phrases are well known among foreigners and conveniently adapted into English, there is no better way to understand the cultural glue that binds Hongkongers than to dive into the stories behind them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The English name for this jam-packed city of more than 7 million derives, perhaps unsurprisingly, from its Chinese name, the characters for which first appeared in Yue Da Ji, a Ming dynasty (1368-1644) publication. But where did the name heung gong - the “fragrant harbour” - come from?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among various theories, the most widely accepted is Hong Kong's history as a producer of incense, specifically agarwood. The village and surrounding bay from which the agarwood was harvested and transported was known as heung gong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the British first docked in Stanley, a local Hakka man informed them the name of the bay. The British apparently assumed this referred to the entire island, and thereafter the romanised name “Hong Kong” stuck.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kowloon</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese characters for the peninsula just across from Hong Kong Island translate to “nine dragons” - a reference to eight hills and a child emperor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After people from the southern Song dynasty in present-day Hangzhou fled from Kublai Khan and his invading Mongols in 1276, the dynasty's remnants, including an emperor's son called Zhao Bing, were pursued across territories by their enemies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/26/c708eb12-5ffc-11e8-a4de-9f5e0e4dd719_image_hires_112645.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao Bing and his court eventually arrived in present-day Hong Kong, where he was enthroned. He saw the eight peaks - Beacon Hill, Crow's Nest, Kowloon Peak, Lion Rock, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Tung Shan, and Unicorn Ridge - and imagined eight dragons in their place. Imperials reminded the emperor that rulers were also prestigiously deemed dragons and, therefore, the place was called “nine dragons” to honour the child monarch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dim sum</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The well-known term is used to describe a collection of small bite-sized Chinese dishes ranging from buns to dumplings and served on porcelain plates or in steamer baskets. A selection of tea accompanies the meal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese characters for “dim sum” translate into “a touch of the heart”, befitting the love affair Hongkongers have for generations had with the meal, and bonding time between companions over choice morsels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some argue that this is false etymology based on the individual definition of each of the two Chinese characters that form a compound term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The alternative meaning of “dim sum” is therefore “to order wishes”, in which the Chinese character “dim” means to place an order for food, and “sum” translates into heart, which could also be interpreted as an intention or wish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While dim sum is usually had in the morning or early afternoon and most tea houses switch to full dinner meals by evening, it has become hip for some restaurants to continue serving the cuisine throughout and brand themselves dim sum houses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yum cha</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two words literally mean “drink tea” in Cantonese, but it has to be interpreted in context - it is usually used in an affable manner to mean the act of having Chinese tea and dim sum or, more generally, catching up over a small meal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The origin of the words “yum cha” can be said to date back to the time of the Xianfeng emperor, the ninth ruler in the Qing dynasty line, from 1850 to 1861. Tea houses serving beverages and a range of small dishes at the time were places that people gathered to hang around, gossip or just to enjoy a meal. In modern times, the activity is particularly popular among retirees for whom many hours can be spent shooting the breeze with old friends at the table.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the term can also be used to mean the equivalent of the Western phrase “Let's go grab a drink some time”, or even “See you later”. Hongkongers who say this when they run into an acquaintance on the street could just be using the term out of politeness. Neither side may be in a rush to fix a date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gaa yau</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Keep going! You can do it! You've got this! Keep your chin up!” These are all ways of cheering someone on in English. The most commonly used Chinese idiom for this, however, invokes a metaphor. “Gaa yau” is Cantonese for “add oil”, which is better understood in English as “to refuel” and to keep pushing ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That said, there was no better, or more literally apt, occasion to say “gaa yau” than in the 1960s during the Macau Grand Prix. Spectators back then started chanting the term to inspire drivers to accelerate by putting the pedal to the metal and, well, adding oil.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of Hong Kong's oldest booksellers, Ling Kee Book Store, is turning to its final chapter, after 75 years in business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a post on its </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> page, the bookshop announced an "honourable closure”, saying its branches would remain open until December 31. It also thanked its customers for their support over the years, and said there would be a clearance sale, with up to 90 per cent off stock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The post did not give a reason for the closure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Ling Kee Publishing Group, which owns the bookshop, said it would not comment further. But he said: "It is not easy to run a bookshop nowadays. But it is only the bookselling business that will cease operating. The group's other businesses will continue as usual.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reactions to the loss of yet another long-time bookshop on Ling Kee's </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> page were emotional. One Macau reader, Emily Fong, recalled a time when she passed by the bookstore during a visit in Hong Kong. "It was marvellous, I got some books and a Peppa [Pig] soft toy for my daughter. She loves it, still loves it. Thank you,” her message read.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another, Eddy Hui, wrote: "Thank you for all these years!!”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ling Kee was established in Hong Kong in 1943. It currently has two branches, one in Central on Hong Kong Island and one in San Po Kong in Kowloon, selling textbooks from preschool to secondary level, as well as general books and children books in English and Chinese, magazines, greeting cards and stationery. It also operates as a textbook wholesaler for schools.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A shift in reading habits among young people in recent decades has made bookshops face more difficult timesTik Chi-yuen, Hong Kong Institute of Family Education</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to the bookshop, the Lee Kee Publishing Group also runs Unicorn Books, which publishes street maps and historical reference books in Chinese. The group also owns Ward Lock Educational and BLA Publishing in Britain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tik Chi-yuen, executive director of the Hong Kong Institute of Family Education said: "Ling Kee figures greatly in the collective memory of many Hongkongers of my age. When we were small, we usually went to Ling Kee to buy textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A shift in reading habits among young people in recent decades has made bookshops face more difficult times. Some have changed their business mode to stay afloat. For example, the Eslite bookshop, it serves more as a fashionable culture spot for trendy people than a place that sells books. People go there to buy gifts or have coffee,” said Tik, referring to the Taiwanese bookshop chain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">News of the closure follows the exit of a number of bookshop chains from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two years ago, the Singaporean chain Page One closed its stores in Hong Kong, ending almost two decades of business in the city. In 2015, Australian chain Dymocks also ended its 15-year presence in Hong Kong. In each case, high rents were blamed for the closures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Awkwardness reigned at a botched annual ceremony in Hong Kong that sends rural leaders to the revered Che Kung Temple on the second day of the Lunar New Year[http://www.scmp.com/topics/lunar-new-year], and it made a light-hearted ritual look more like a joke.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the mix-up on Saturday at Tai Wai, a fortune stick pulled by event organisers on behalf of the whole city could have been mistakenly exchanged[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2133650/mixed-messages-dog-including-switch-fortune-sticks-hong] with the one drawn for Sha Tin. The confusion gave rise to a face-saving move by the New Territories patriarchs, who argued that what transpired might have been what the deity had in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's a look at what exactly happened and the history behind the highly anticipated ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Who is Che Kung, and why is he worshipped?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kung is an honorific title given to a respected man in ancient China. Legend has it that Che Kung was a military commander of the Southern Song dynasty (1127 to 1279). It is said that he escorted the dynasty's last emperor in his escape to what is now called Sai Kung in the New Territories. His achievements led to his being revered as a god.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin was built around 300 years ago in a desperate move by local villagers to stop a health epidemic that swept the area. According to popular folklore, the epidemic began to subside on the day temple construction was completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why is there an annual ritual of Heung Yee Kuk leaders going to the temple to draw fortune sticks for Hong Kong?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heung Yee Kuk is a government-recognised advisory body that represents the interest of New Territories villagers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ritual is held annually on the second day of the Lunar New Year, to coincide with the Che Kung Festival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ritual enables rural patriarchs to thank the Che Kung deity for protecting locals over the past year. But the elders also ask the deity to drop hints about what the coming year holds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The custom was that a home affairs official would attend the ritual with kuk leaders. After the city introduced a ministerial system in 2002, the home affairs minister represented the government in drawing a fortune stick for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The luck of the city for that upcoming year was thought to be foretold by the message corresponding to the stick, in the form of classical Chinese poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in 2003, then home affairs minister Patrick Ho Chi-ping[http://www.scmp.com/topics/patrick-ho] drew an unlucky stick. And that year, Hong Kong was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. As for Ho, he is now behind bars[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2122552/former-hong-kong-home-affairs-secretary-patrick-ho] in the United States[http://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states] over a bribery case.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2003, the government has not sent a minister to participate in the event. Instead a kuk leader is tasked with pulling a stick for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another embarrassing moment arose in 2015, when veteran politician Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee[http://www.scmp.com/topics/regina-ip] was accidentally knocked over[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1722768/unicorn-hero-who-collided-regina-ip-lunar-new-year-accident-breaks] during the ceremony by a unicorn dancer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's superstition, so why is it a big deal?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trying to foresee the fate of a city merely by drawing a stick is plainly superstition. Yet the event is widely covered. Politicians are quick to offer their own interpretations of Che Kung's message, often seizing on the opportunity to attack rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Media take it seriously too; reports on the deity's prediction are printed across local newspapers the next day. Fortunes are chosen from a container filled with 96 sticks. Of these, 35 are “good”, 44 “neutral” or “medium”, and 17 “bad”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What happened on Feburary 17?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kuk chairman Kenneth Lau Ip-keung and Sha Tin rural committee vice-chairman Lee Che-kee were drawing fortune sticks simultaneously, with Lau drawing one for Hong Kong and Lee for Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau's stick was number 41 - deemed “neutral”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the master of ceremony wrongly announced the stick as having been drawn by Lee. When he tried to correct his mistake and clarified that the stick had actually been drawn by Lau, he mixed up Lau's stick with the one picked by Lee. Then he announced the number of that stick, 21, which is also “neutral”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apparently unaware of the error, no one in the ceremony tried to rectify the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the foul-up was witnessed and filmed by the scores of reporters attending the annual ritual.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Written as a poem in Chinese, the message on stick number 21 was interpreted as “the harder the city works, the more it will achieve”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The message on Lau's original stick, number 41? “Be cautious for everything”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau was later told of the mix-up but said both sticks sounded good to him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is the Heung Yee Kuk going to do anything to rectify the mistake or avoid future blunders?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sha Tin rural committee chairman Mok Kam-kwai has ruled out an investigation into the botched ritual. He said that if there had been a mix-up, it had to have been arranged by the deity and that Hongkongers should accept it. However, Mok said the body would look into whether any improvements could be made to avoid similar confusion in the future.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Everyone else might be excited about the prospects of Luger stretching or even beating Able Friend in the Group One Champions Mile at Sha Tin this afternoon but a long career in training has taught John Size that one of the basics is not to put the cart before the horse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size has been a Champions Mile winner before and on both sides of the fence - Electronic Unicorn's win in 2003 had more in common with the expectations on Able Friend today, but his 2009 success with Sight Winner was a 64-1 shock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luger's spectacular Derby win after sitting off the track in an unrelenting pace juxtaposed with world champion miler Able Friend's supposed dip in form in winning the Chairman's Trophy is a recipe for a match-up that has caught the imagination.I'm a realist - my hope is that Luger runs his race and he pulls up well. I'm long past the point of going to races with high expectationsJohn Size</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Like everyone else, I'm looking forward to the contest, but I just don't want to be too disappointed," Size said yesterday on the eve of Luger's biggest challenge and perhaps Able Friend's biggest challenger for some time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm a realist - my hope is that Luger runs his race and he pulls up well. I'm long past the point of going to races with high expectations - I'd prefer to keep them low and hope for a nice surprise. Able Friend's a super horse, you don't expect to just turn up and beat a horse like that."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size is not buying the argument that Able Friend disappointed in the Chairman's Trophy, however it appeared.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That vision can be an illusion, and the idea that he was tired or disappointing might just be wishful thinking. It's unrealistic to think horses will keep turning up and performing the same way but he did win the race after all," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Able Friend put in his best run at his eighth start last season when he ran second to Variety Club in this race, and this time it's his seventh run. I can only worry about Luger and I'm happy with the process, I just can't control the outcome."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the seven-time champion trainer has any expectations for Luger, they are off in the distance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The way Luger's record reads, you would hope that, as a five-year-old, he'll develop the strength to be one of the better horses around. As for Sunday, it's a small field, it's tricky and the opposition is strong. If he races well, I'll be happy to take him to Japan for the Yasuda Kinen."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wise Talent Information Technology, which operates China's largest job recruitment site Liepin, is seeking to raise as much as HK$3.12 billion (US$400 million) in Hong Kong - the second biggest IPO by a unicorn company this year after Ping An Good Doctor's US$1.1 billion listing in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wise Talent, backed by venture capital firm </span><span class="s3">Matrix Partners</span><span class="s1"> China, plans to sell 88 million shares at an indicative price range of HK$28.5 to HK$35.5, it said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail tranche - 10 per cent of the total offer size - will hit the market from Tuesday to Friday next week and it will start trading on June 29 on Hong Kong's main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese leaders always say talent is the country's foremost resource, so companies all over the country want to upgrade their talent,” Rick Dai Kebin, chairman, CEO and founder of Wise Talent, told a press conference in Hong Kong on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Are you an internet firm or a hardware maker?' regulator asks Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi ahead of IPO[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2150986/are-you-internet-firm-or-hardware-maker-regulator-asks-chinese]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that since a lot of overseas highly-skilled Chinese are gradually returning to China for employment and using our platform, so there is a big demand in the market. “We want to take advantage of this opportunity and the appetite for high-end talent,” adding that the IPO was well-timed because of the rapid growth in Chinese tech start-ups and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liepin, launched in 2011, is China's largest job recruitment site by revenue. Its database included 248,600 companies, 38.9 million professionals and 101,800 headhunters in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, its revenues jumped 40 per cent year on year to 825 million yuan (US$128.4 million), more than 95 per cent of which came from corporate customers. It also generated profit for the first time in three years, posting a net income of 7.55 million yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dai said the company wants to increase its domestic market share by adding more companies and individual users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the reason for choosing Hong Kong as a listing destination was because “the IPO will have a good effect on the brand and bring a more open and public image to our customers, and help improve trust and build partnerships”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forty per cent of the IPO proceeds will be used to enhance research and development capabilities, such as hiring AI and data specialists to improve existing matching algorithm and develop AI-empowered voice and facial recognition technologies to interview potential job candidates via robots.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 25 per cent will be used for potential acquisitions or investments, 25 per cent in improving sales and marketing initiatives, and the remaining 10 per cent for working capital purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Wise Talent's IPO value has been halved from the US$800 million reported in January by IFR, a Reuters publication.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's attempt to turn itself into a listing hub for new economy companies has started to bear fruit. Five major technology companies have debuted since September. These will be followed by Xiaomi's upcoming IPO, which is expected to be the world's largest since 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But of the five tech listings since last year, three have dropped below their IPO prices - ZhongAn, </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, and Razer.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With less than six months left in the hot seat, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and his administration is not going gently into that good night. First came news before Christmas that Hong Kong will build a local branch of Beijing's Palace Museum[http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/arts-music/article/2061276/palace-museum-hong-kong-opens-door-wealth]. Then, right after the New Year, the government announced an even bigger project: the Lok Ma Chau Innovation and Technology Park[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2058878/hong-kong-and-shenzhen-set-partner-innovation-and-technology], on the border with Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 87-hectare site, which could easily swallow four Victoria Parks, will give the two neighbouring cities "unprecedented space and opportunities" to complement each other's advantages, officials say. But why does a city like Shenzhen, which has nurtured global giants such as Tencent and DJI, still need us?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of Hong Kong's traditional advantages are still in place: a low and simple tax regime, a sound legal system, freedom of expression, press freedom and ease of setting up a company. But other cities are desperate to attract the same kind of companies the Lok Ma Chau park will be gunning for - fast-growing technology start-ups and creative industries - and they offer attractive perks and a more nurturing environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Young, an industrial designer who moved to Hong Kong from Britain 10 years ago, says many designers think it is a no-brainer to set up shop in mainland China. "The Shenzhen government once offered me free use of a huge office for three years, plus half a million yuan (HK$563,000) to cover the set-up cost. The Foshan mayor's office also approached me. That's why so many creative people from all over the world are heading to Shenzhen and Shanghai. It's mainly financial," he says.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tommy Tse Ho-lun, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong focused on the development of Asian cultural industries, says despite its draconian laws and heavy censorship, China offers investment but also "cultural capital".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With less than six months left in the hot seat, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and his administration is not going gently into that good night. First came news before Christmas that Hong Kong will build a local branch of Beijing's Palace Museum[http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/arts-music/article/2061276/palace-museum-hong-kong-opens-door-wealth]. Then, right after the New Year, the government announced an even bigger project: the Lok Ma Chau Innovation and Technology Park[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2058878/hong-kong-and-shenzhen-set-partner-innovation-and-technology], on the border with Shenzhen.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 87-hectare site, which could easily swallow four Victoria Parks, will give the two neighbouring cities "unprecedented space and opportunities" to complement each other's advantages, officials say. But why does a city like Shenzhen, which has nurtured global giants such as Tencent and DJI, still need us?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of Hong Kong's traditional advantages are still in place: a low and simple tax regime, a sound legal system, freedom of expression, press freedom and ease of setting up a company. But other cities are desperate to attract the same kind of companies the Lok Ma Chau park will be gunning for - fast-growing technology start-ups and creative industries - and they offer attractive perks and a more nurturing environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Young, an industrial designer who moved to Hong Kong from Britain 10 years ago, says many designers think it is a no-brainer to set up shop in mainland China. "The Shenzhen government once offered me free use of a huge office for three years, plus half a million yuan (HK$563,000) to cover the set-up cost. The Foshan mayor's office also approached me. That's why so many creative people from all over the world are heading to Shenzhen and Shanghai. It's mainly financial," he says.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rather than owning properties, UR Work signs long-term leases of 10 to 15 years to remain asset-light.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The co-working space sector is already fiercely competitive. Many offer chic working environments, modern furniture and the free use of smart services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between the Chinese capital and Shanghai, more than 500 co-working sites have been set up over the past 18 months, JLL data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most existing urban offices are sub-let to small companies. But as the pace of "mass entrepreneurship" - championed by Premier Li Keqiang - has faded many start-ups have fallen by the wayside, the victims of rising rents, cutthroat competition and increasingly impatient investors, which are also challenging a growing number of co-working space operators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Time is a critical for the survival of such start-ups as this is an arena that only allows a few winners, just like other sharing economy sub-sector. Those who get funding first, get the chance to win, " said Ding Zuyu, co-President for E-House (China) Holdings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UR Work says it is seeking expansion overseas, with planned new sites in Singapore, New York, London and Taiwan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early December, it signed an agreement with International Enterprise Singapore and CapitaLand Limited, hoping to help Chinese and Singaporean small firms to enter the global market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ucommune said on Thursday it has acquired competitor Fountown for an undisclosed amount, marking the fifth acquisition the Beijing-based co-working space unicorn has made this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fountown operates 26 co-working offices in Beijing and Shanghai, which would bring Ucommune's offices in Beijing to 88 and in Shanghai to 42. Ucommune has offices in 37 cities across the globe in total, including New York, Hong Kong, Taipei and Singapore among others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The macro environment has seen significant shifts in the past three years. We have seen greater uncertainty in the economy and an increasingly competitive environment with the arrival of new entrants,” said Mao Daqing, founder and chairman of Ucommune, in a company statement. "Therefore, mergers and acquisitions are necessary for leading companies to maintain their competitive advantage and stay relevant to clients' requirements,” he continued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Mao is positive about the future of co-working businesses in China, given "the increasing momentum of urbanisation, upgrades to the service-based economy and urban renewal.” Co-working space has grown in popularity globally amid a rapid rise in new digital economy start-ups and a need for more flexible and creative work spaces. Real estate is typically the second-largest operating expense for a company, excluding staff wages.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ucommune, which competes with US co-working giant WeWork in China, was previously known as UrWork. Ucommune announced in August that it raised 300 million yuan (US$44 million) in pre-series D financing, which valued the company at US$1.8 billion. Ucommune has acquired four China-based co-working start-ups before Fountown - Wedo, Workingdom, Woo Sapce and New Space.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao told the Post in an interview in May that he would consider an IPO for the three-year-old firm, possibly in Hong Kong in the coming two to three years. I want Ucommune to be independent, so an IPO is certainly an option,” he said. "But I am not against the idea of being acquired,” he said in the interview[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2146513/chinese-co-working-space-provider-ucommune-considering-hong-kong-ipo].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although mainland China has always been Ucommune's priority, the company has recently attempted expansion in Asia by setting up two offices in Singapore. It is also planning to open two offices in Hong Kong soon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apprentice Victor Wong Chun faces the next challenge in his fledgling career after bidding farewell to his 10-pound claim at Happy Valley on Thursday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 24-year-old notched his 20th Hong Kong winner after leading all the way on Sichuan Boss, appropriately for his boss Tony Millard in the Class Four Dandelion Handicap (1,650m).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It takes Wong to seven winners for the season, which puts him equal fourth in the jockeys' championship, but he will find things harder now his claim drops to seven pounds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He rode to instructions and rode a good race - he showed a bit of maturity there,” Millard said. “He's a work in progress. Obviously, we'd like to see him step up and he's going to have to as the new handicap comes in. That's a challenge for him and he is certainly well aware of that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most valuable allowance in town is no more: Victor Wong gets the fractions just right on Sichuan Boss in HV R3 and will see his claim reduced from 10lb to 7lb from Sunday after his 20th HK success. #HKRacing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKRacing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/93ijqUz8eQ[https://t.co/93ijqUz8eQ]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 18, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1052900084575166464]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Everybody is looking for success and so is he, he works hard and does a lot of things right but he needs to shine up in a few areas. He will get the opportunity to do that here and hopefully he can step up.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The win was Millard's first at the city track this season and he still holds the early lead in the trainers' championship over freshman Jimmy Ting Koon-ho, who leapt into second with a double.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holy Unicorn (Matthew Chadwick) and Fine With Me (Keith Yeung Ming-lun) took out races four and five, meaning Ting now has an impressive 10 winners from 35 runners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no secret, I've just focused on making the horses happy,” the trainer said. “If the horses are happy, then they run well.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trainer Ting stings at the double! Fine With Me and Keith Yeung withstand a whirlwind late surge from Lucky Shiny Day in R5 at the Valley. And Jimmy T's rookie record now reads ten winners from just 34 runners. #HKracing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKracing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/kNnrf7hAbt[https://t.co/kNnrf7hAbt]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 18, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1052917044348239877]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fine With Me beat Lucky Shiny Day by the barest of margins, leaving jockey Ben So Tik-Hung still chasing his first winner of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the second time on the night a Peter Ho Leung-trained horse had gone down narrowly after Very Rich Man was overhauled right on the line by Junzi in the opening event.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Ho did manage to land a winner when Matthew Poon Ming-fai found the line first with Split Of A Second in the Class Four Aster Handicap (1,200m).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Timing is everything and Split Of A Second is delivered at the perfect moment by Matthew Poon to get the better of Fantastic Fabio in R2 at the Valley. #HKRacing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKRacing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/XByPbh8Lgw[https://t.co/XByPbh8Lgw]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 18, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1052891567604690944]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We haven't had a lot of luck,” Ho said. “[Split Of A Second] was just a bit weak and a bit immature last season, but he has developed a bit, is a bit stronger and more focused and that's why he won. Hopefully he can improve a bit more.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Moore scored his first Valley winner of the season when Storm Signal relished the step back to 1,000m to secure his maiden Hong Kong victory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was Moore's first winner at the city venue since Bingo saluted on April 11 - one of just two he had there across the all of last term - but the trainer said it will be more of a focus going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's never been a track that I have really focused on but John Size now runs a lot more horses here so I've got to take that into consideration, we've got to aim a few more horses here to win more races here,” Moore said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There will be a lot more runners from the Moore stable at Happy Valley this season and hopefully they can be competitive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking of Size, he took out the final two races on the card with favourites Red Warrior and Country Star - both of them partnered by Zac Purton.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Red Warrior is owned by former Jockey Club chairman Ronald Arculli and he will be hoping to take that good form to Melbourne this weekend when Purton partners another one of his horses, the Ed Dunlop-trained Red Verdon, in the Caulfield Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Jockey Club has confirmed three-time champion jockey of Britain Silvestre de Sousa has been granted a licence to ride in Hong Kong from November 1 to February 28.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang who controls acquisitive conglomerate Fosun Group plans to spend 4 billion yuan (US$630 million) to buy a controlling stake in dating service provider Baihe Network, charting a new course into the online matchmaking business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo, 51, has agreed with 32 shareholders to buy 869 million shares, or a 69.2 per cent stake, at 4.6 yuan apiece, according to a statement published by Baihe on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The billionaire will conduct the buyout through Ningbo-based Yuanhong Investment, a firm that is wholly owned by Guo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baihe, one of the mainland's largest dating sites, is traded on the Beijing's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, or “new third board”, an over-the-counter equity exchange slated for technology start-ups.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yuanhong aims to chase high-growth opportunities in new economy businesses related to the internet,” Guo's company said in a statement. “After the acquisition, the company expects to profit from the further growth of Baihe.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017 Baihe posted a net profit of 65 million yuan, reversing from a loss of 114 million yuan a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's services span online and offline dating, consulting and event organising, including wedding planning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, Baihe acquired and privatised Nasdaq-listed </span><span class="s3">Jiayuan.com International</span><span class="s1">, one of its major rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Compared to e-commerce and e-payment, online dating is a market that has yet to be fully tapped,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management. “The number of registered users appears to be huge and online matchmaking has the potential to grow.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baihe has 310 million registered users and 200 outlets that offer dating services.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai Tiandihui Supply Chain Management, China's largest online road transport operator, is eyeing an initial public offering after closing the latest round of financing from a clutch of yuan-denominated investment funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu Shuibo, founder and chief executive of Tiandihui, said the technology start-up would turn profitable in 2018 after four years of operations. That would be a big step towards a mainland listing as the domestic stock exchanges begin scrambling for home-grown unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's taken time for the mainland market to understand our businesses,” he said. “But the key lies in whether the IPO applicant has convincing operating data. We are making efforts to show investors our growth potential and solid performance.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui raised 500 million yuan (US$79.1 million) in a third round of financing led by CICC Jiacheng Investment Management, a subsidiary of investment bank </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, whose online platform matches lorries with cargo in more than 50 cities across the mainland, would not disclose its valuation after the financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on annual revenue of 5 billion yuan in 2017, its valuation could have reached US$1 billion, the threshold for an unlisted technology firm to become a unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If it were to make a profit this year, it would meet the earnings requirements of mainland securities regulators for an A-share listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will keep our fundamentals unchanged to chase profits,” Xu said. “More importantly, we want to expand our business scale faster in this untapped market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He did not elaborate on the time frame for an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui seeks fresh funds to expand to supply chain finance[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2104821/tiandihui-seeks-fresh-funds-expand-supply-chain-finance]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui, dubbed China's </span><span class="s3">CH Robinson</span><span class="s1"> - a US multimodal transport services provider - aims to roll out its operations in 80 mainland cities and double its revenue to 10 billion yuan in 2018, Xu added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are actively hunting for mainland unicorns as the central government encourages technology firms to raise funds on the domestic equity market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move is part of efforts to support a transition of the Chinese economy into a sustainable growth model driven by entrepreneurship and consumer spending.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui is among the few large Chinese tech firms that has publicly revealed a clear intention to list on the domestic bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, nearly all Chinese technology companies conducted IPOs in overseas markets such as Hong Kong and New York because their ownership structure and performance were not in compliance with the mainland's listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Foxconn Industrial internet, a unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer, received a fast-track approval to launch a 27 billion yuan IPO on the Shanghai exchange just five weeks after it filed its application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiandihui handled transactions worth 118 billion yuan in 2017, nearly double the amount a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Road transport makes up 60 per cent of China's 11 trillion yuan logistics market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The staggering size of the logistics sector is seen as a drag on the country's manufacturing industries because they end up footing a huge bill for transport costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aside from expanding its network and investing in new facilities, Xu said the proceeds from the fundraising would also be used to reinforce Tiandihui's supply-chain finance segment. Tiandihui offers loans to logistics firms operating on its platform to help them upgrade their fleet of trucks and enhance efficiency.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size has the unusual luxury of a rest day today to consider whether he should pursue an international start with Real Specialist or keep those ambitions for later on after the five-year-old returned in triumph yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With 133 pounds on board and certainly no dream run through the </span><span class="s3">Panasonic</span><span class="s1"> Cup (1,400m), Real Specialist and Douglas Whyte looked destined for the also-ran basket even at the 300m mark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But just as his rivals looked to have him covered, Real Specialist lifted himself over the final stages to grab New Vision and Keen Marie right where it counts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With 100m to go, I wasn't going to get there, but he sticks his neck out and really wants to win," Whyte said later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Earlier in his career, he got to that point and he wanted to go left or right and be wayward. He got away with it in the lower grades but he's had to change his attitude to make transition to being a big horse, and he's done that now. If he gets into these big races coming up, he won't be there just making up the numbers. If the big names make a mistake he'll be there to zap them up."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Size's first Hong Kong season, he announced his arrival by producing Electronic Unicorn in the same race to win in stunning fashion before taking the Chevalier Cup next as his stepping stone into the internationals, but that option isn't open to him with Real Specialist as his rating now will render him ineligible for that race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That leaves Size's options as backing up in the Jockey Club Mile next weekend to roll out his credentials for the Longines Hong Kong Mile next month, or not running again until international day, December 9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Well, I've got a day to think about it since we raced on Saturday not Sunday," Size said. "I'll see how he is at home and if I think he can back up, he will.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If I think the best thing for him is to have a few weeks before he runs again, then that's what he'll do. His rating isn't enough to command an automatic call-up for the international race, so there's a Class One on international day that he can run in if the Jockey Club doesn't select him."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Real Specialist only scrambled home, both Size and Whyte highlighted the win was far better than the on-paper result might indicate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The short margins at the top end of the race and the time are probably not a good indication of the performance," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Real Specialist has often been able to park close to the pace in his races and Whyte said he didn't lack any gate speed yesterday, but he opted out of trying to use it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He had speed but I could see the ones inside me weren't going to let up, so I dropped off and let him drift back rather than having to do too much for too long with that weight," the jockey explained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was the best thing I could have done, as it let him find some momentum back there, but I got put even further back at the 800m when Kyara was being untractable and came out in front of me."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The win took Real Specialist's impressive record to seven wins, three seconds from 13 starts, with his only failures when tried at staying distances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the winner rightly took all the plaudits, the John Moore-trained pair of Kyara and Silver Grecian ran shockers, although the vets found substantial blood in the trachea of Kyara, which would explain his flop.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed live streaming game platform Douyu was named the fastest growing technology company in Asia Pacific, according to global accounting and consultancy firm Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wuhan Douyu Network Technology Co, operator of douyu.com, a website similar to Amazon's Twitch, has seen its revenue surge 707.8 times over the past three years as live-streaming and mobile gaming continues to grow in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The revenue surge comes as the three-year-old start-up achieved unicorn status in June after investments from backers including Tencent and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> helped vault its valuation to over US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies that are focused on providing China's millennials with inexpensive entertainment options, such as gaming and live streaming, or those focused on e-commerce and fintech, are continuing to succeed,” William Chou, Deloitte China's managing partner in technology, media and telecommunications, said in a statement on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market penetration of digital technology in China continues to grow, with those born after 1990 showing a much higher propensity to consume online content due to greater acceptance of digital payments and credit facilities, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Live-broadcasting has taken off in China, becoming one of the hottest sectors in China's rapidly evolving internet environment, with nearly 400 million people regularly watching live broadcasts via mobile devices, according to iResearch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new, low-cost pastime was estimated to have generated US$3 billion in revenue last year, up 180 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu, whose name literally translates as “fighting fish”, is one of the many companies that built a business around gamers broadcasting their online matches and sharing their strategies with fellow gamers, before expanding to other kinds of live streaming content such as cooking lessons, cosmetic tips and outdoor sports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have worked very hard since we began in 2014 and have now started earning profits as a result,” Chen Shaojie, founder and chief executive of Douyu TV, said in a statement. Chen declined to elaborate when contacted for follow up questions by phone.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Wuhan-based start-up is competing with over 200 competitors including Panda TV, a live-streaming game site backed by Wang Sicong, the son of China's second-richest tycoon Wang Jianlin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Asia Pacific region continues to be at the forefront of revolutionary digital change,” said Toshifumi Kusunoki, a Deloitte leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China continues to dominate the tech sector in the region, claiming five spots in the top 10 list of fasting growing tech firms in Asia Pacific, and 119 in the Technology Fast 500 ranking. The lists are compiled by Deloitte based on a company's financial year revenue growth over three years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New York city headquartered co-working space operator WeWork will focus its China business in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing in the near future while leveraging the connections and networks of its local partners as a means to fend off aggressive domestic competitors, its co-founder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The copycats are interesting because some of them branded themselves as ‘WeWork of China', which helped establish us before we were there,” Miguel McKelvey, co-founder of the “unicorn” valued at around US$17 billion last year, said during the opening ceremony of its space in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay district on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“More people and businesses are moving in this direction...we are making our products the best,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to the two locations it currently owns in Hong Kong, WeWork is slated to open its first Beijing location in May, and another two in the Chinese capital in the near future. It also plans to bolster its two existing locations in Shanghai with three more work spaces in co-operation with its Chinese investment partners, which include property developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Zhao, chairman of mainland private equity fund Hony Capital, one of WeWork's key investors, said sentiments for investing in the US were recovering as concerns eased after US President Donald Trump talked to China's leadership. Zhao added that he believes cross-border investment from China to the US would increase rather than be dampened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> moves 300 staff into WeWork hot-desking site in Causeway Bay</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A consortium led by </span><span class="s3">Hony Capital</span><span class="s1">, joined by its parent company </span><span class="s3">Legend Holdings</span><span class="s1">, Shanghai's Jinjiang hotel group, and two property player Oceanwide Group and Greenland Holdings, invested a total of US$690 million in WeWork last March, securing a boardroom seat after the investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The founders realised very quickly that their company should be both global and local. Now through our connections, Hony has brought in some very powerful local partners,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Group</span><span class="s1"> is weighing an investment of well over US$1 billion in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported in late January. However, WeWork executives didn't confirm the report during Thursday's media interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Right now we don't have anything to announce [about fund raising], but it's something we've always been considering. As for going public, we are certainly preparing for it internally, but we have no time frame,” said McKelvey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ole Ruch, managing director of Asia and Australia for WeWork, said occupancy rates for their space was very high, reaching 90 to 95 per cent in mature markets. He added that the company would open new space in India soon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past several years Hong Kong has been trying to reinvent itself as a hi-tech hub, looking to turn start-ups into the next </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">. But with the focus on technology, other entrepreneurs say they are being neglected, even though they feel they are just as important to the city's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After his recycling business collapsed four years ago, Wouter van Marle established a hydroponics start-up, which allows Hongkongers to use their balcony or rooftop to grow vegetables such as choi sum and bok choi, as well as herbs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Van Marle self-funded his business - also known as bootstrapping - but found it difficult to tap sources for financing and marketing advice, which were more widely available for tech start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“From the point of view of investors, I don't really understand it. Because the chance of making money with [my business] is much better than the chance of making the next big thing on the internet,” van Marle, owner of City Hydroponics, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Of course, they will never make billions on this, but the chance of making it profitable is much greater.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Van Marle added that there were “many more of these relatively small ideas” being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the government's investment promotion arm, </span><span class="s3">InvestHK</span><span class="s1">, there are about 2,000 start-ups in Hong Kong - mostly tech-related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the internet boom, Hong Kong was mainly a trading and finance hub for the region. But the internet revolution has investors and the government clamouring to find the next technology unicorn - a company valued at more than US$1 billion - leaving traditional or low-tech businesses to fend for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecka Lundin, a full-time product developer for a major international clothing retailer in Hong Kong, moonlights as a skin care start-up entrepreneur. She said she hoped for subsidised spaces for low-tech retailers to help generate interest in businesses like hers - an advantage given to tech start-ups in areas such as the Science Park in Sha Tin and Cyberport in Pok Fu Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would love to have a workspace that's also retail all in one,” Lundin, the owner of Swedish's, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lundin said she got the feeling “nobody cared” about businesses like hers and she would like to have support similar to tech start-ups so she could concentrate on her business full time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chinese University associate professor of economics Terence Chong Tai-leung argued that the government could not support every industry and would probably like to sunset certain low-tech sectors in favour of hi-tech industries, hoping to hit the jackpot with another Apple or GoGoVan - an app-based transport and logistics service and one of Hong Kong's successful unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other than subsidised work spaces, the government also provides for tech start-ups an incubation programme which provides up to HK$330,000 in financial assistance, subsidised legal fees, subsidised training, trade fair or exhibition services, advertising subsidises and networking and mentorship opportunities. Most of these are not available to low-tech start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now, however, two local entrepreneurs have decided to take matters into their own hands and establish their own start-up that helps low-tech small businesses and home-based entrepreneurs get noticed by customers and potential investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anasua Chatterjee and Sai Sudha Chandradekaran started Hidden Truffles in 2014 after seeing a wide range of start-ups with customers confined to family, friends and peers, without the knowledge or money to break out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Somehow we felt all of them were stunted in their growth and were only kept within friend circles ... they did not have a way to grow professionally,” Chandradekaran said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most home-based start-ups received an opportunity to meet their customers in person at various pop-up bazaars held around the city several times a year, Chatterjee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But going beyond bazaars was where start-ups would succeed, the pair believed. So the duo started “pitch nights” for entrepreneurs to get start-up owners out of their comfort zones and thinking outside of their usual customer base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They've stopped thinking beyond B2C [business to customer], and pitch night allows them to strike a professional relationship with somebody unknown and coach them about doing business in this day and age,” Chandradekaran said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After three years, their company has a listing of about 250 ultra-small businesses which can be discovered by customers, investors and firms. They have also seen audiences grow for their pitch nights, which Chatterjee and Chandradekaran said proved there was still interest in low-tech, home-based, small businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Two judges from one of our pitch nights asked us to connect them with two of the businesses because they wanted to follow them and see if there was potential to invest in them,” Chandradekaran said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UrWork, a major shared work space provider in China, has taken its rivalry with US giant WeWork into Southeast Asia by financially backing an Indonesian start-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based UrWork took part in an early round of funding that raised US$3 million for ReWork, which will use the cash to bankroll its expansion from Jakarta to the island of Bali. The fundraising was led by ATM Capital and Indonesia's Convergence Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With 88 locations in 25 Chinese cities, UrWork is one of China biggest players in the co-working field. A recent round of financing valued the company at US$1.5 billion. It is a direct rival of the American giant, WeWork, which recently made its own foray into Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As Chinese co-working companies look overseas and move to cater to medium-to-high end tenants, such changes will inevitably pose challenges to WeWork," said Yu Kexin, an analyst iResearch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As it launches eight new locations at home, UrWork aims to move into 32 cities worldwide, setting up 160 shared workspaces over the next three years, according to a statement posted on the company's website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision came around the same time that WeWork announced its plan to acquire Singapore-based SpaceMob as part of a US$500 million investment in Southeast Asia and South Korea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UrWork, with its continued fundraising and overseas ambitions, has been seen as a threat to the US unicorn as it doubles down in the world's second largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The co-working sector has taken off in China over the past three years, thanks partly to the country's efforts to promote entrepreneurship. According to iResearch, the market was worth 4.29 billion yuan at the end of 2016. Rent generates 80 per cent of income for space providers and added incubation services and government subsidies another 10 per cent each.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The co-working sector is still in its infancy in Southeast Asia. Global partnerships will enable companies to learn from mature operating models and provide extensive services to tenants," said Yu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2074381/singapores-sovereign-wealth-fund-invests-chinas-co-working-space-start]ReWork currently works with property owners on a revenue-sharing basis, but is in talks with larger real estate firms over joint ventures as it eyes rapid expansion, according to a report carried by TechCrunch. The company is looking to expand into major urban markets including Bali and Bandung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the markets in Southeast Asia may still need time to pick up steam, despite the region's start-up boom and fast-growing economy, said Chen Xi, founder of Xspace, a start-up based in Manila specialising in providing shared workspace to Philippine Chinese people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Co-working is more like an extension of the real estate industry," Chen said. "In reality the Southeast Asian market may be even more sophisticated than the one in China because of the complicated human relationships and investment constraints."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese coffee chain operator Luckin Coffee has raised US$200 million in its latest funding round, doubling the valuation of the </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> challenger in just five months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The B round of fundraising was led by its existing investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1">, Joy Capital and Centrium Capital, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest investment follows a July A round when Luckin raised US$200 million at a valuation of US$1 billion, bringing the Xiamen-based start-up unicorn status in the six months since a soft launch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin has expanded to over 1,700 stores in 21 major cities across China and claims "thorough” coverage of downtown Beijing and Shanghai, where there's basically a store within a five-minute walk for everyone, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will continue to increase capital investment in product research, technology innovation and business development, and continue to optimise our product and user experience,” Qian Zhiya, Luckin chief executive said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up promises an average customer in major cities that they need only wait about 18 minutes after placing a delivery order through their phone to receive their coffee, Qian said in a July interview. Such orders would be fulfilled by "takeaway kitchens” where coffee is prepared exclusively for on-demand service.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The man who battled Travis Kalanick to a standstill and forced </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> to pull out of China is unperturbed by talk of a challenger to his ride-hailing throne.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you want war, you will get war,” Cheng Wei, the co-founder and chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, the world's biggest ride-hailing company, said in a recent interview with Caijing Magazine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng, 34, was quoting 12th-century Mongolian warrior-ruler Genghis Khan, whose empire spanned Asia to the Adriatic Sea, in response to a question about competition from </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, which has advertised its plans to expand into the ride-hailing industry in several Chinese cities with offers of steep discounts to consumers and rebates to drivers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi, which counts hi-tech giants Apple, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings among its biggest shareholders[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1944553/apple-invests-us1b-didi-chinas-uber], is itself born from a truce between two rival ride-hailing companies[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1713463/leading-taxi-apps-kuaidi-and-didi-us6b-merger-counter-ubers] that had engaged in a ruinous price war, which at one point went as far as giving consumers free rides to win market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After that merger, the combined entity took on Uber, which pulled out of China in 2016[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1997821/uber-sells-chinese-business-didi-chuxing] in return for a minority stake in Didi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Didi has withstood the fiercest competition in history, from Kuaidi to Uber. We have PK'ed countless rivals,” said Cheng, using a local slang for duelling. “</span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> may not be the weakest, but it may not be the strongest either.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng's comments were confirmed by a representative of Didi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Headquartered in Beijing, Didi last week secured more than US$4 billion in a new equity funding round led by Japanese conglomerate </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Group Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That lifted the Chinese ride-sharing company's valuation to about US$56 billion and boosted its cash reserves to US$12 billion[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2125203/chinas-didi-chuxing-raises-us4bn-new-funding-taking-total-more], according to a person familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi, which serves more than 400 million users in China, said that investment will support its business expansion initiatives, including in artificial intelligence and the development of new energy vehicle service networks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping had raised US$4 billion in its latest funding round in October, giving it a US$30 billion valuation that places it behind Uber, </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, and ahead of </span><span class="s3">SpaceX</span><span class="s1">, the space travel start-up founded by Elon Musk, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights.</span></p>

Last year, New York-listed Alibaba reached a deal to sell its stake in Meituan-Dianping[http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/1906522/china-internet-giant-alibaba-eyes-global-retail-expansion-quarterly] for a reported US$900 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping signalled its ambitions to expand into ride-hailing on Thursday, when it unveiled a new booking icon on its mobile app, with a pledge to start services in Beijing as soon as it collects 200,000 sign-up clicks from future customers and drivers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It doesn't matter which platform I have to work with, as long as it puts more money in my pockets,” said Li, 40, a driver for Didi in Beijing who only gave his family name. “Right now, Didi takes 20 per cent of the ride fare as commission.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In light of what were otherwise quite routine events at the Jockey Club last week, the seventh race on Sunday gave us pause to wonder about a particular direction that is being taken.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unless you happen to be in the ballot for a racehorse ownership permit of any kind, the results of said ballot are enough to make the eyes glaze over and might be prescribed as a cure for insomnia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But underneath the prosaic announcements of the successful applicants last week, there were some numbers that had us scratching our heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the June 2008 ballots, the Jockey Club announced names of the members who had secured permits for 80 Private Purchase (PP) horses, those with previous careers somewhere else; 200 Private Private Purchase Griffin (PPG) horses, that were unraced anywhere; and 25 Subscription Griffins. The SGs are no more but also were unraced horses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A year later, and again the following year, the spill was 100 PPs and 220 PPGs. Yawn. You're right, but stay with us. Then someone's bright idea changed the formula and not for the better.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, there were permits for 220 PPGs again but 120 PPs, which rose to 130 the following year and now to 150. And the list for PPG permits shrank to 180 last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why is this wrong? Why would anyone care? Because any increase in PP permits leads to an increase in uncompetitive runners, a step backwards for any racing jurisdiction, let alone one that prizes its place at the leading edge. It also runs contrary to certain smart owners' initiatives the club introduced at the turn of the century.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the seventh race on Sunday was a lovely example of what happens when PPs flood the market: of 14 runners, seven were 100-1 or longer - some much longer - and all of the centurions were PPs which, for reasons of acclimatisation, fitness, unsuitability or modest talent, were not going to play a part.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ironically, the winner was also a PP, Able Friend, but a well-prepped, talented animal from a stable capable of producing competitive debutant PPs. They are a rarity and only a handful win each season. This term, seven PPs have won their Hong Kong debut and that is a boom year. More often the score is two or three.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So we have a regular scenario that sees PPs go out at 100-1, not only on debut but for the first four or five times we see them, until they drop from Class Three to Class Four in many cases and start to be competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ninth Galaxy had eight turns as a triple-figure punching bag and there are many that run at 100-1 three, four and five times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During this season, we have seen 761 runners at 100-1 or better, so how many were PPs? Remove the horses which have been here for more than one season and you're left with the "P" and "N" horses and then remove any international visitors which might have been at those odds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 196 "P" branded horses left - this season's imports - which ran around at 100-1 in any start, 135 were PPs. From the 322 "N" horses to run at 100-1, the percentage is lower, at 203 PPs, but still significantly higher than the horses which arrive unraced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously raced horses are an important part of the scene. Many of our best have been PPs, though PPGs like Fairy King Prawn, Electronic Unicorn, Silent Witness and Ambitious Dragon etc weren't too shabby, either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unraced horses lacking education, health or talent are still a better deal for owners - they find their levels faster, and are usually cheaper to buy than PPs with the same issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then you have replacement permits. Just over a decade ago, the club made some adjustments to rules allowing owners to replace horses and they've been tweaking them ever since. But no matter how you slice them, replacing a PPG is more satisfactory than having to replace an overpriced, under-talented PP with another of the same.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Raced horses with talent, that somebody actually wants to sell for a reasonable price? Trickier to find than Edward Snowden.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By increasing the number of PP permits, the Jockey Club is actively encouraging more uncompetitive runners in races, which should be the opposite of its intentions. With turnover rising by double digits, it's difficult to suggest to anyone at Sports Road that something is bad for turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a way, it's right - as long as Hong Kong is bordering China and money of whatever colour keeps leaking in ever larger droplets across the border, we are not expecting turnover to drop again. Ever. But that doesn't mean a policy should be acceptable simply because its obvious and negative effects will be masked at the bottom line.</span></p>

The country's social commerce market will top US$150 billion with 24 million merchants selling on such platforms by 2020, according to e-commerce marketing firm Advangent.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A series of successful recent initial public offerings suggests Hong Kong's stock exchange may be turning into a listing hub for technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the transformation is something of a mixed blessing as two large international companies with a traditional business focus announce their departure from the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new trend shows the exchange's efforts to get more "new economy" companies to list their shares here is bearing fruit, while past attempts to attract and retain international companies have proved less successful.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange, traditionally a hub for financial and property companies, has seen several technology IPOs in recent weeks selling like hot cakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though Hong Kong is one of the largest IPO destinations in the world in terms of funds raised, it has until now not been popular with technology companies. It ranked only 12th worldwide for tech IPOs in the first eight months of this year, below the likes of New York, Switzerland, Singapore and South Korea, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, funds raised through tech IPOs in the same period surged threefold to US$18.87 billion from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO market has been dominated by financial firms, which made up 59 per cent of funds raised between January and September, while technology companies accounted for a mere 0.8 per cent, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent spate of tech IPOs hopefully represents a turnaround. The latest data from the stock exchange shows IT shares had become the third largest category in the Hong Kong stock market as of the end of September, after property and finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO trend is likely to continue, particularly after the regulator and the government supported </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in launching a pilot scheme next year to allow "unicorn" internet companies - those with a valuation exceeding US$1 billion - with dual class shares structure to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The red hot fintech IPO rally started with online-only insurer </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which launched the biggest listing by a financial technology firm in Hong Kong's history in September, locking in about HK$200 billion (US$25.64 billion) of capital in an offering that was nearly 400 times oversubscribed ahead of its debut, making it the most popular flotation of the year at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Literature listing expected to leave ZhongAn's IPO in its shadow[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2117813/china-literature-listing-expected-leave-zhongans-ipo-its-shadow]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its record however was quickly and easily surpassed by China Literature, the mainland's largest online publishing and e-book site, which has just completed its IPO this week and is expected to be oversubscribed by more than 600 times and lock up about HK$520 billion (US$66.66 billion). That would make it the second highest on record after </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction Corporation</span><span class="s1">'s IPO locked up capital of HK$540 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US-based gaming equipment maker Razer, which is backed by </span><span class="s3">Intel Corp</span><span class="s1"> and Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, also started its IPO in Hong Kong on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a natural trend for investors to shift their focus to the technology and new economies as mainland companies such as Tencent or Alibaba are not just coming out with good innovations, but also delivering profits," said Clement Chan Kam-wing, managing director of accounting firm BDO.Hong Kong investors are very smart. They put their money on whatever sector or companies promise them a good returnClement Chan Kam-wing, managing director, BDO</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong investors are very smart. They put their money on whatever sector or companies promise them a good return. The trend of fintech and other technology companies listing in Hong Kong is set to continue in the coming year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These technology IPOs are very popular with Hong Kong investors. Many investors want to take a quick profit after seeing the strong share-price rally of the technology companies in both Hong Kong and overseas," said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn's share price shot up at least 60 per cent from its debut at HK$59.7 on September 28 to HK$90.8 on October 9 before dropping back to HK$77.3 at Thursday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides retail investors wanting to make a quick profit from the tech IPO bonanza , large institutional investors are also chasing these stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The primary listings of technology-related companies in Hong Kong benefit from the level of local investor participation as well as international investor interest. Investors are seeking good liquidity and coverage by analysts," said Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of insurance company AIA Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the lock-up of so much capital in the tech IPOs and other technology-related stocks has dried up the liquidity in traditional stocks, prompting two international firms to opt for exit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week's sizzling IPO bonanza was counterbalanced somewhat by news of the delistings of the two companies, which had faced a cold response from local investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American luxury brand Coach announced on Wednesday that it would withdraw from its secondary listing in Hong Kong because of thin trading. That came a day after </span><span class="s3">Glencore</span><span class="s1">, the Swiss commodity trading and mining firm, said it would delist on January 31 next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Coach and </span><span class="s3">Glencore</span><span class="s1"> launched their secondary listings in the city in 2011, after the Hong Kong stock exchange ramped up its marketing campaign to promote the value of an expanded equity presence to multinational companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their departure suggests their listings had not helped HKEX to become more international. Hong Kong stock market is still very much dominated by mainland companies, which account for 38 per cent of the main board's market capitalisation and 47 per cent of its turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the top 10 most traded stocks in Hong Kong in the third quarter, eight were Chinese firms, with only </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and HKEX itself as the exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX proposes latest ‘Connect' system - this time to lure more foreign listings and then link them with Chinese shareholders[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2112258/hkex-proposes-latest-connect-system-time-lure-more-foreign]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, chairman of Christfund Securities and a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the current tech fever may be just a short-term phenomenon. He believes investors would still be interested in buying the shares of good quality international companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's very important for HKEX to fight for the many infrastructure projects of the Belt and Road Initiative to list here. And it's likely that if HKEX could successfully fight for </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list here, it would be the world's largest IPO and would encourage investors to trade these international stocks listing in Hong Kong," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia is considering listing about 5 per cent of the state oil giant next year, which would raise US$100 billion if the firm was valued at about US$2 trillion as hoped.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will soon be possible to rent a flat with a facial scan and pay automatically by locking the door when you leave, thanks to blockchain-enabled "smart contracts", according to </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> is developing applications that, when combined with biometric recognition, will make the home rental experience "more convenient and efficient", said Geoff Jiang, the company's vice president and head of Ant Technologies Lab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is building a smart contract platform which can be applied to industries such as the industrial, finance and leasing markets," Jiang told the South China Morning Post on the sideline of the Alibaba Computing Conference in Hangzhou, where the company is based.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A "smart contract" is a self-executing agreement stored on blockchain, where the executions are triggered automatically when certain terms have been met. It is believed to be one of the most promising applications for business-related blockchain technology.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of Alibaba's initial projects included working with the Hangzhou Realty Administrative Bureau in developing a leasing regulation and service platform that came online last month, where property agents, tenants and landlords register using facial scan and all transactions are recorded to prevent fraud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The interest in blockchain by the real estate industry coincides with the central government's effort to boost the residential leasing market to counter endless price rises of homes in the country's first and second-tier cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cities including Beijing, Chengdu and Hefei have announced plans to increase land supply for rental housing and encourage the setting up of more property leasing firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jiang said the key to success lies in finding "killer applications" that are both practical and suitable for smart contracts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> has confidence in blockchain. With distributed ledgers, internet of things and data sharing, a lot of [technology] revolutions await Alibaba," he told the Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stars have aligned for Unique Awesome in a Class Four on Sunday at Sha Tin, where the Almond Lee-trained three-year-old stands out as banker in the opening leg of the Triple Trio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A step up to a mile at his third career start looks perfect for the youngster after a strong closing effort and barrier one on the C+3 course should allow for a perfect trailing run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After a debut run where he scooted home for fifth, Unique Awesome found himself right in the market two starts back and on face value was disappointing. He raced back in the field, Alvin Ng Ka-chun had trouble settling the gelding, and he was one-paced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when he relaxed better last start, Unique Awesome caught the eye at the end of 1,400m to indicate a step up in distance was in order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He maps to get a nice trail behind obvious leader Heart Wood, who will be first-up for a new stable off a three-month break and with 10-pound claimer Jack Wong Ho-nam aboard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heart Wood has needed a light weight in Class Four to win previously, and requires all the favours in the way of a nice draw or soft lead in order to do it, but he could get that here. Heart Wood will be carrying 118 pounds and he could easily get the lead without much pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though Malayan Pearl can sit handy and has front-running apprentice Dicky Lui Cheuk-yin on top, he hasn't been able to show the speed to press forward over 1,600m, the lower end of his distance scale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From gate one, Unique Awesome can roll along behind and either settle in the box seat or three back the fence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It could be a "Unique" quinella in the race, with Unique Joyful (Keith Yeung Ming-lun) the obvious danger after a strong last start display. The Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained four-year-old has put together a string of consistent efforts and is another who looks ready for the step up to a mile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last start, Unique Joyful sat three wide with no cover and up near the speed, yet still stuck on gamely to be beaten just a half length. The trouble for him here is another wide gate on the C+3.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next best is Chris So Wai-yin's Asia Rising (Douglas Whyte), whose runs at 1,600m and beyond have been solid and has run on for third in his two starts down in Class Four. He needs some tempo to show his best, but should be right in the contest anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a race that lacks depth, but include Unicorn (Zac Purton) despite his wide gate, and consider Imperial Gallantry (Howard Cheng Yue-tin).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the second leg, a Class Four over 1,200m, take a chance on a horse that has been disappointing since his early season win, Benno Yung Tin-pang's four-year-old Sensation (Purton).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sensation trialled well since his last start and drops into a lovely draw, gate two, from where Purton should get the run of the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take Sensation as banker ahead of Spitfire (Nash Rawiller), who gets a great chance at a second career win from barrier one after a solid effort behind impressive newcomer Bayonet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ten Flames (Derek Leung Ka-chun) and Thors Bolt (Whyte) look the best of the closers and go in despite being hampered by tricky draws.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Size sends first-starter Coup D'Etat (Joao Moreira) straight to the races after a solitary trial in New Zealand and two local efforts, neither of them impressive, where he was asked to chase. He still should be included out of respect for the stable, and while another debutant This Is Gladiator (Cheng) might not be in the market, he should be kept safe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the final leg, take Gold Dragon (Neil Callan) as banker, with the Richard Gibson-trained three-year-old coming back to 1,400m, where he looks more comfortable with the help of a soft draw.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It looked like Bear-Pop (Moreira) had his birthday last start when he got all the favours and even though he drew out here, this is a weak contest and he has to go in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also take Never Better (Purton), Elegance Klammer (Olivier Doleuze) and Golden Partners (Damian Lane).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As an analyst covering tech start-ups in China, Zhao Ziming has seen some really wacky ideas cross his desk. Even so, he was surprised by his cousin, who was preparing to launch a start-up to share rolls of toilet paper.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My cousin said he always cannot find toilet paper in the restrooms in most office buildings in China, so he is going to start an app to share toilet paper, at one yuan for a roll,” said Zhao, who works for Beijing-based consultancy Cyzone. “I told him that was a really stupid idea and brought him to some restrooms in Beijing to prove that his idea can't work, that there's no demand for sharing toilet paper.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has seen an entrepreneurial fever sweep the population, lured by tales of exponential riches made seemingly overnight and news about a new class of billionaires minted by the internet boom. Venture capital funds were awash with money and chased marginal ideas, leading to a boom-and-bust cycle that is now still playing out particularly in the so-called sharing economy, which is a term for owners renting out something they are not using.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reminiscent of the dotcom boom in the late 1990s when any company that added a .com suffix</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">guaranteed investor interest, many start-ups in China have raised millions of dollars by shopping around concepts tied to sharing. Except that start-up founders and the venture capital money funding them have moved on from cars and homes, represented by the likes of Uber and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, to areas like rental of bicycles, power banks and even life-size companion dolls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flood of money, though, appears to be slowing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China-based companies raised a total of US$8.8 billion in the quarter ended September, or about half of the US$16.8 billion raised in the same period two years earlier, according to data compiled by Dow Jones VentureSource.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unicorn fever seizes China as start-ups and investors seek the next big thing[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2125953/unicorn-fever-seizes-china-start-ups-and-investors-seek-next-big]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest proportion of that money - 42 per cent - was invested in consumer services, a broad category that covers everything from bicycle sharing and second-hand car trading to online learning. Fintech, shorthand for computer programs that support banking and financial services, was second with about 32 per cent of the investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other reports put the amount of funds raised by sharing start-ups at about US$24.4 billion in the first seven months of this year, about enough to fund two new US aircraft carriers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the most prominent sectors attracting institutional investment is bicycle sharing, which has been popularly referred to as one of China's four modern-day “inventions” together with high-speed railway, mobile payments and online shopping. The reference itself is a nod to ancient China's role in the making of paper, gunpowder, printing and the compass.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bluegogo, once China's third-largest bike-sharing start-up, abruptly closed down in December, leaving scores of users with unreturned deposits. Wukong Bicycle ceased operations after just five months, followed swiftly by 3Vbike, which was mainly offering its services in third-tier cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At its peak, there were about 100 companies offering similar dockless short-term bicycle rental services in China. The market was so crowded - not to mention pedestrian walkways outside subway stations and major tourist attractions - with multi-hued bicycles that those late to the game ran out of colours to paint their bikes. These days, only three companies, Mobike, Ofo and Hellobike, are seen to have enough scale and financial muscle to potentially survive another price war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The casualties aren't restricted to bicycle sharing. Beijing-based car-sharing companies Ezzy and Youyou, as well as umbrella-sharing company Huoli Modeng and sleeping-capsule sharing enterprise Xiangshui Space all announced they had ceased business operations this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These start-ups typically failed because they had run out of funds before being able to find a sustainable profitmaking model. Many times, these companies had to effectively give out their products and services for next to nothing in the hopes of building a sizeable user base that they could then either charge a fee (once the other competitors all died off) or sell the data to some third-party user to mine for marketing and sales leads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese entrepreneurs are very keen on expanding market share to gain leading position,” said Kerry Lai, the founder of a three-year education start-up in Shenzhen who is looking for a business partner to help with the company's expansion. “It can easily lead to insolvency or bankruptcy if revenue cannot keep up with the aggressive expansion.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the era of fast-and-easy money largely over, venture capital investors like Andrew Yanyan are becoming more selective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I have become humbler and more cautious in selecting investment projects and entrepreneurs over time because of my experience of failure,” said Yanyan, who has been in the venture capital industry for over 20 years and is founding managing partner of </span><span class="s3">SAIF Partners</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separating good ideas from bad is easy compared with identifying a good start-up founder, which is arguably a more important determinant of the company's eventual success, he said. “But I myself get confused about what makes a good start-up founder.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Zhao at Cyzone, the current fever for all things artificial intelligence, spurred on by high-profile backing by the central government, is a harbinger of a bust to come.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The golden time of attracting investments only by ideas has passed,” said Zhao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now people and capital are shifting their attention to artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the coming two years, closures will increase in these sectors.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six years ago, fewer than a dozen big venture capital firms were based in Chengdu, said Wu Zhong, general manager of Yinke Venture Capital. And most of the ones that were there, operated without a functioning office or staff. Whenever an industry seminar came to the city, organisers called contacts on their list but no one was ever in town.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Organisers don't have that problem now, as venture capitalists arrive in a steady stream, renting prime office space and executive residences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yinke Venture Capital has witnessed the breakneck growth of Chengdu's private equity industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2009 by the Chengdu government and </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> with 1.5 billion yuan ­(HK$1.74 billion) in capital, the fund of funds has teamed up with national players to foster promising companies in emerging industries. By March, its funds were managing a combined 6 billion yuan in assets.We are bullish on Chengdu's economy, and there are enough promising start-upsWu Zhong, Yinke Venture Capital, general manager</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But unlike some fund of funds backed at the local government level, Yinke doesn't require its funds to invest a certain proportion in home-grown firms, Wu said. While Yinke had such requirements for its general partners during the early years, they found this "non-market-oriented" approach didn't work, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the project is really good, general partners certainly will invest. If not, how can you demand them to invest?" Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the fund of funds does require their investments to actively engage in local fairs and funds should be locally incorporated, with local offices and resident staff.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are bullish on Chengdu's economy, and there are enough promising start-ups. The question is whether they can effectively spot them. This is why we require them to operate locally," Wu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chengdu Detong-YInke Capital Fund, launched with Shanghai-based Detong Capital, outperformed other eight other parallel yuan-denominated funds under Detong's management, with annualised growth of more than 50 per cent since it was founded in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">General manager Li Nong said his fund would like to remain rooted in Chengdu as his team was bullish about the opportunities, citing the defence, high-end manufacturing and agri-tech sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm committed to spotting ‘original' unicorn companies. If the company is in Beijing and Shanghai, it will immediately be pursued by numerous funds. But here we get the opportunity," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As one of the earliest venture capitalists to arrive in the city, Li has seen the industry grow from infancy. He said the city had better potential to become a private equity centre before could turn into true financial centre. "Private equity is special because despite its small scale, it's extremely active and can stimulate the whole system," Li said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The John Size-trained Sight Lover has not been the kindest to punters, but Triple Trio players will look to him as a banker again in the opening leg at Happy Valley tomorrow night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sight Lover has been well in the betting at most of his 10 starts and has delivered only once but he got along well with Weichong Marwing last start, finishing second to Oyster over the Valley 1,650m, and the pair up again from a good draw in what looks an open event to start off the fresh TT pool with a $2 million prize on offer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another with serious claims looks to be maiden three-year-old Riyadh (Olivier Doleuze), who has been runner-up at both his starts for Michael Chang Chun-wai over the this course and he has his hoof right on the till. Both times he gave away a start to the race leader who went on to win and he should be hitting the line strongly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the placings, punters should certainly include track-specialist Ottimo (Alvin Ng Ka-chun), thereabouts in his three attempts since a drop back to Class Four, Silver Dragon, who should benefit from the removal of blinkers after running along a touch too freely in the lead last time, consistent Ambitious Treasure and a rejuvenated Easy Ahead (Ben So Tik-hung). It is several seasons since Easy Ahead's only win, leading all the way over this course, but he is showing signs that he is ready to go in again and should lead this field from the pole barrier. Two solid runs at the Valley were followed by a last-start seventh running on late over 1,200m at Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle leg offers a solid double banker in three-year-old Bundle Of Joy (Brett Prebble), despite an awkward draw, and another lightly raced runner, Beauty Sparkle (Matthew Chadwick).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The winner of two of his three starts, Bundle Of Joy looks destined for much higher in the ratings and his tactical versatility looks an important factor in this race with plenty of speed. It won't surprise if he is ridden off the pace rather than leading as he was when he won last start from Beauty Sparkle over this course.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beauty Sparkle gets a nice weight turnaround on Bundle Of Joy for that last meeting and he has drawn the coveted barrier one. Although a year older than Bundle Of Joy, Beauty Sparkle is also one with some upside after only six starts and he is close to a win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is a long list of place chances to consider, with Croesus (Tommy Berry), Mr Ginger (Zac Purton), Cour Valant, Diamond Elegance and Formula Won all capable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final leg looks a tricky one, but banker seekers could do worse than settle on Supreme Essence (Doleuze). The Michael Chang-trained gelding has raced into some form over sprint courses with a third to Impeccable and fifth to Sea The Pearls but goes to a more suitable 1,650m this time. That's the kind of distance over which he was a three-time winner in France so we should see the best of Supreme Essence now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be hard to leave out the likes of Flying Unicorn (Purton) and Intellectualstride (Gerald Mosse), who are racing well over the trip, and Happy Champion's debut at the extended Valley mile when finishing fifth after being squeezed out early was sufficient to convince Prebble to stick with him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The honest eight-year-old My Home Town gets the benefit of Dicky Lui Cheuk-yin's 10-pound claim and looks a likely leader in the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The eight-year-old's latest effort was sound when fourth to Galaxy Prancer after playing front runner and he looks a compulsory inclusion as well from barrier two.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Playing a pair of well-drawn fancies as a double banker in the final leg of tomorrow' nights Triple Trio at Happy Valley can deliver punters a share of a jackpot-boosted dividend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Barrier draws are critical when the rail is in the "C+3" position, and starting positions of Spirit Soaring and Freak Zone - drawn four and five respectively in a Class Three over the extended mile - can help them figure in the finish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The TT has been hard to crack in recent weeks, and with more than HK$7 million carrying over into this week's pool, a pay out of HK$13 million is expected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Spirit Soaring (Tim Clark) and Freak Zone (Zac Purton) come in off narrow defeats against in-form or progressive opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many European imports, John Moore's Spirit Soaring has taken a long time to acclimitise - taking 11 starts to run a place and battling some lameness issues along the way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two juvenile wins and three lengths sixth at Ascot in the Jersey Stakes gave the former Clive Brittain-trained charge a starting mark of 86. He had dropped to the brink of Class Four - a mark of 61 - when the gelding showed some spark last start with his light weight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The extended mile is where his previous career-best effort locally was, and in a short head second to Forgive And Forget showed an ability to take up a midfield spot and a nice turn for foot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clark replaces Eddie Lai Wai-ming, with the gelding now allotted 117 pounds after a three-pound hike for the bold last-start effort.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caspar Fownes' New Zealand-bred Freak Zone has also been troubled by leg issues, a left front tendon injury sidelined him earlier this term after an impressive first-up run over 1,400m at Sha Tin. Freak Zone got into a real dogfight with Victory Master and never gave in, the winner going on to win again in Class Two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fownes has switched to visors - essentially blinkers with a small slit cut in the cowl - after the four-year-old had worn conventional shades in his first two runs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He heads to the Valley for the first time but had a trial at the city track under Zac Purton and did everything right.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another horse with tendon problems, but who seems like he could be about to turn a corner - the Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained Cheer (Howard Cheng Yue-tin) - a six-year-old whose rating once budged triple figures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At one stage, Cheer won four races and was placed five times in the space of 13 starts, taking his rating to 99. Then persistent front tendon issues plagued the gelding, and eventually surgery was required.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His rating had dropped to where he has found himself in Class Four - and Cheer clearly appreciated the drop in grade when he was a solid fourth. The key is the switch back to the Valley, where the horse has been unplaced just twice in 11 starts and has notched all four of his victories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The options are limited after that, but three horses widely drawn but worth some consideration are New Greenfield (Brett Prebble),last-start winner Noble De Best (Umberto Rispoli) and My Home Town (Richard Fourie).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drawn one, Able Magic (Derek Leung Ka-chun) is the obvious stand out in the first leg, a Class Four over 1,650m, from Always Something (Olivier Doleuze), Forever Ahead (Brett Prebble) and Goldmen Y Y (Lai).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the middle pin, Fownes has utlilised Alvin Ng Ka-chun's seven-pound allowance on Dream Builder, who has drawn five in a Class Three 1,200m sprint. Take him as a banker from Gold Ball (Doleuze), Rainbow Fighter (Weichong Marwing) and Perfect Finish (Keith Yeung Ming-lun).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese students returning home with overseas educational qualifications are still likely to be paid better in the short and long run, than those educated at home, although fresh graduates arriving back on home soil have become more realistic in what salary levels to expect in their first jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wide-ranging new latest research, polling 100,000 Chinese grads, suggests Chinese students armed with a foreign degree are this year being paid 17.2 per cent more than those graduating from a home university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carried out by BossZhipin, a Beijing-based big-data recruitment firm, the study showed 26.3 per cent of fresh graduates from overseas universities are being paid over 10,000 yuan (US$1,500) and 2.3 per cent more than 20,000 yuan per month in their first jobs in China - which is double, and triple the level of the average domestic graduates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But interestingly, the advantages of an overseas educational grow even more pronounced in the longer run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After eight years in work back home, 43.2 per cent of the returnees can now expect to be paid over 20,000 yuan a month, 30 percentage points more than domestically counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Newly returned students, on average, pitch for expected monthly salaries of 8,315 yuan, but in reality they are actually being paid 7,306 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of more ambitious returnees looking for upward of 15,000 yuan per month has lowered their expectations, with 11.6 per cent this year, from 13.8 per cent in 2016, while those who are happy to be paid below 8,000 yuan have increased from last year's 41.2 per cent to 45.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Beijing, maybe unsurprisingly, are the biggest magnets for returning graduates, accounting for 28.8 per cent and 24.9 per cent, respectively. Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Guangzhou ranked 3-5, attracting 8.6 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Official Ministry of Education data shows 544,500 Chinese left to study abroad last year, of which 498,200 were self-funded. But the rate of returnees this year has soared to 80 per cent, compared with just 30 per cent a decade ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher earning potential and more promising career prospects have helped internet technology-related sectors overtake financial and professional areas - such as lawyers and accountants - to become the most desired choices for returnees looking to settle at home, despite half of them being armed with business or finance degrees, the study also showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year, 16.2 per cent of returnees chose to work for internet firms, up 3.1 per cent from 13.1 in 2014. Business and financial sectors attracted 14.9 per cent compared with over 18 per cent three year ago, followed by education and training (13.4 per cent), media's (8.7 per cent) and culture and entertainment (6.4 per cent).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet giants and so called unicorn start-ups (those with US$1 billion+ valuations) were shown to be the best payers and students also considered them as offering the best career prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consulting, legal, accounting and auditing jobs still offer handsome pay packages, and were identified as being ideal to build future connections, although more are losing out now to hi-tech recruiters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although internet companies are most popular among returners, just 42 per cent of those who accepted job offers from them actually had computer science- and natural science-related majors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business and financial majors were the most common, accounting for over a half of returning students over the past two years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores Technology Group, a Hong Kong-listed contractor-turned-blockchain investor, plans to raise HK$100 million (US$12.7 million) via a digital token fund to finance a yen-backed cryptocurrency project.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores Technology's pivot to blockchain investment is the result of an acquisition of SHIS by a company controlled by Yongjie Yao in May and its subsequent back door listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao is also a founding partner of the 10 billion yuan (US$1.45 billion) Hangzhou Grandshores Fund backed by the Hangzhou government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other backers of the fund include Li Xiaolai, the bitcoin tycoon of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Grandshores Technology chairman said the company would tap qualified investors outside China to raise funds denominated in tether, a US-dollar backed stablecoin and list it on a cryptocurrency exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset such as gold or hard currencies like the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said Grandshores was seeking to fund start-ups and cryptocurrency projects globally as he believes some blockchain unicorn-hopefuls were on track to disrupt the traditional financial system and break monopolies currently enjoyed by tech and internet giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Blockchain will become the mainstream technology in the next three to five years,” said Yao, who is also a part-time lecturer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. “We are entering the next stage of blockchain evolution, a stage which is akin to when computer operating system was transiting from MS-DOS [disk operating system] to MS-Windows.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the yen stablecoin project, Yao said the founding partners of the Hangzhou Grandshores fund, are currently working with a mid-tier Japanese bank, whose name he refused to divulge, in creating a stablecoin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said he sees demand for a yen-linked stablecoin, and is hopeful of launching the token by the end of this year or early 2019 and the next anchor currencies Grandshores will explore are the Hong Kong dollar and Australian dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe cryptocurrency traders and exchanges will be potential takers of these stablecoin,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many cryptocurrency exchanges already trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and EOS against tether. Grandshores Technology's yen stablecoin could provide an alternative that can be traded on these exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao was also an early investor in Canaan, the world's second largest maker of bitcoin mining rigs which is seeking to raise US$1 billion and list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has invested 107 million yuan in Canaan since 2015 through his own blockchain venture fund, and is expecting returns “to the tune of several hundred times”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, the founding partners of Hangzhou Grandshores fund, together with some of its affiliated funds under Grandshores Technology, have invested 500 million yuan globally in blockchain and cryptocurrency projects outside China. These include Zcash, an open-source cryptocurrency that offers selective transparency of transactions; blockchain start-up GX Chain and blockchain-based social media network ONO.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ucommune chairman Mao Daqing has predicted no more new players will enter China's crowded co-working office space industry as the pace of consolidation picks up in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao said this will remain the story moving forward, following a series of mergers initiated last year by Ucommune, the country's largest co-working space provider, with domestic rivals Woo Space, Wedo Coworking and New Space.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The merger of different platforms sped up our [growth], which was the most exciting thing for me in the past year,” he said on Wednesday as the company, formerly known as UrWork, marked its third anniversary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2015, Beijing-based Ucommune now has more than 100,000 individual members and 6,000 corporate clients at 160 locations across 36 cities, including Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as New York and Los Angeles in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's co-working space unicorn holds firm at home amid push into to Europe[http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2120393/chinas-co-working-space-unicorn-holds-firm-home-amid-push-europe]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's expansion strategy has put it on a collision course against larger US co-working space operator WeWork, which agreed to merge last week with Chinese rival Naked Hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeWork, counted among the world's most valuable start-ups at about US$20 billion, will pay about US$400 million for the three-year-old Chinese business, according to Bloomberg. The deal adds co-working spaces in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, as well as Vietnam, Australia and Britain to the portfolio of the New York-based firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies such as Ucommune and WeWork are flourishing because a rising number of young workers are opting for flexible working hours and a more relaxed working environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising number of technology start-ups bolstered by Beijing's ambitious goal of turning the mainland into a global innovation powerhouse has created a strong demand for flexible offices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Co-working spaces taking China by storm[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125778/co-working-spaces-taking-china-storm]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A survey by global property services company JLL found that 81 per cent of white-collar respondents in Shanghai now accept working in flexible offices, compared with 24 per cent at the end of 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An explosive growth of co-working offices can be expected as the authorities ramp up support for start-ups by offering them fast track listing approvals, and more young entrepreneurs set up their own shops,” said Daniel Yao, research director with JLL.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global market for co-working office space is forecast to reach 30,432 locations and 5.1 million members by 2022, according to co-working conference organiser GCUC. Those numbers are up from 14,411 co-working space locations and 1.7 million members last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GCUC estimated the Asia-Pacific to continue growing rapidly over the next five years, with China becoming the world's largest co-working office space market by 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao, the 49-year-old founder of Ucommune, said the sweeping consolidation in China's co-working office space market will see only the biggest companies survive as new investments in the industry decline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the country's sharing economy saw plenty of investors and start-ups “trying to get a slice of the pie”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that frenzy dies down as soon as a couple of billion-dollar start-ups, known as unicorns, emerge in the market, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Comparing the co-working space business with the once red-hot bike sharing market, Mao said “one is a moron if someone says he wants to do bike-sharing now”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bike-sharing has been among the most prominent sectors that have seen weaker players drop out as funding dried up. The consolidation in bike-sharing followed that in ride-hailing, which saw fierce competition between rival platforms before </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> emerged to take on and eventually acquire the China operations of </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After kicking out Uber, Didi now faces a new challenge. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, the world's largest on-demand delivery platform that is known as the Chinese </span><span class="s3">Yelp</span><span class="s1">, is expected to launch a national expansion of its ride-hailing business after debuting the service in Nanjing city in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's sharing economy raised a record 216 billion yuan (US$34.4 billion) last year, an increase by more than a quarter compared from a year earlier, according to a report by the State Information Centre, which predicted that competition among platform companies will intensify and drive the number of mergers and acquisitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mergers and acquisitions in this business is quite normal,” Mao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the country's co-working space market, Ucommune's string of mergers has helped lift its valuation to 11 billion yuan (US$1.7 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has raised US$525 million in total venture capital funding, more than the rest of China's co-working space providers combined, according to venture capital research service CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York start-up WeWork just made a big play for China's co-working crown[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2141411/new-york-start-just-made-big-play-chinas-co-working-crown]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is backed by a group of large multinational and Chinese investors, including </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Zhen Fund</span><span class="s1">, Noah Wealth Management and Sinovation Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, if history is any guide, one cannot rule out further developmentsfor co-working space providers amid efforts by Baidu, Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, the parent of South China Morning Post, to become more involved in the sharing economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese bike-sharing start-up Ofo last month secured US$866 million in a new round of financing led by Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mao, a former vice-president at Chinese residential property developer Vanke and grandson of Beijing's Great Hall of the People architect Mao Ziyao, said the co-working space market has been relatively outside the sphere of activity of the Chinese internet triumvirate known as BAT.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are not like the internet companies who must choose to side with one of these giants,” Mao said. “But we collaborate with BAT.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shopping tags that link directly to a product listing are not new: China's social commerce companies have been using them since 2015, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> tried something similar in the same year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's boom in online shopping and its penchant for social networks has seen companies such as Pinduoduo and Xiaohongshu tap the so-called Social+ business model where they offer e-commerce services underpinned primarily by a social community.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaohongshu, which has its roots in a social community for Chinese users to discuss and share overseas and cross-border shopping tips, first implemented shoppable tags around 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai-based social commerce firm, with 80 million users, is popular as a platform to discuss cosmetics and skincare products, with users able to share photos of their latest purchases on their feed, tagging the name and brand of each item before linking it to a product listing page within Xiaohongshu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gates to a medieval castle open and in comes a majestic queen riding a silver unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Juxtaposing the archaic castle is a ghostly hologram of Lady Gaga's face floating high above - welcoming you to a world where anything goes, where Mother Monster herself can pop out of a gigantic womb or be pressed into a meat grinder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga launches into her top hit Born This Way in a jewel-encrusted black gown with outstretched wings like a goddess from hell. The crowd goes wild with their iconic Little Monster claw raised up high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you find the painful screams, the gory meat dresses and the almost-naked dancers' homoerotic caresses a little hard to stomach, then find the exit, because Lady Gaga couldn't care less.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga splays her legs - and freezes - before a male dancer's face, leaving the audience to finish the thought with their cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All the breathless dancing and techno beats may have blanketed the au naturale essence of Lady Gaga's songwriting talent, and a highlight is when she rides a motorbike onto a stage that serves as her keyboard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She sings the misty-eyed Hair on her keyboard and bellows, urging the audience to be "as free as [their] hair".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But "classics" such as Bad Romance and Just Dance drew the loudest cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lady Gaga's costumes - as spectacular as her music - are worth noting. In one playful moment she wears a dress that extends into a keyboard, placing a hand between her legs while pretending to grace the keys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between the arches of the medieval castle - the backdrop of the stage - hang large chunks of meat. It's Lady Gaga's new take on her famous meat dress as she performs Americano - and ends with her disappearing into a meat grinder.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial services industry is likely to move towards an ecosystem of traditional banks collaborating with innovative start-ups, technology and telecom companies, forging strategic partnerships and adopting fintech solutions to enhance service offerings, according to </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The introduction of a new licensing regime for virtual banks by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> this year, which deliver retail banking services through the internet or other electronic channels instead of physical branches, is a significant factor in bringing a new era of smart banking to the city. The city's de facto central bank has set a deadline of August 31 for receiving applications for the first batch of virtual banks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initiative is designed to give new players - non-banks - a level-playing field to set up banking operations to supplement their existing non-financial services to enhance customer-focused digital services, said Paul McSheaffrey, partner and head of Hong Kong banking at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China, in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By adding a range of financial and payment services from cinema ticket purchases to booking taxis on to their core messaging and gaming businesses, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">' </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> Pay and Ant Financial Services' Alipay have become the primary platforms of choice and are winning the competition against traditional banks to engage Chinese retail customers in financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong is still lagging behind in developing digital banking. Control over the predominant platforms in Hong Kong is still undecided, which is the key to owning the valuable customer relationship, said McSheaffrey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What is crucial in Hong Kong is it has still not been decided who will run the platform [of digital banking], which is still up for grabs. It is likely to be a combination of technology companies and banks together that will drive this ecosystem,” said McSheaffrey.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company that is going to be truly successful will be the one that owns the customer relationship and the interaction with the users allowing it to generate data and tailor products and services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means the company will be able to select other providers to provide services on its platform to give what the customer wants, and thereby capturing the most value while other companies merely are “service providers”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trust, personalisation and convenience are also factors that are needed to enhance customer experience, said McSheaffrey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whichever company that can control the customer relationship, that is where the real value is going to be,” McSheaffrey said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology has already enabled traditional banks to provide basic online and mobile banking services but new entrants should provide an impetus to traditional banks to collaborate with innovative start-ups that would change how many retail customers and small medium enterprises consume financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab joins fintech race to become Hong Kong's first licensed virtual bank [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2144899/welab-joins-fintech-race-become-hong-kongs-first-licensed]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many fintech companies have developed innovative technology that can enhance the overall customer experience, lower the costs of financial products and facilitate the granting of loans to consumers who otherwise do not have the credit history to obtain finance from traditional banks. This could encourage traditional banks to further develop their own platforms and customer-focused digital services, thereby raising the bar across the entire banking sector in Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab, Hong Kong's home-grown fintech unicorn, told the Post in May it would be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the HKMA after the guidelines were issued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> has teamed up with internet giant Tencent and online travel provider Ctrip, and is seeking more tech partners to develop its virtual banking services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Opportunities to banks are likely to arise from the ongoing development of the Greater Bay Area in southern China to transform the region into a global technology hub.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ambitious Dragon was beaten but not bowed in the Jockey Club Mile yesterday for the second year running and trainer Tony Millard quickly called for a rematch in the Longines Hong Kong Mile next month with his conqueror Glorious Days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wearing blinkers for the first time, the John Size-trained Glorious Days (Douglas Whyte) was smashed in betting from 6.5 to 2.8, then travelled like a new horse in running and beat Ambitious Dragon at his own game in the sprint down the straight to win by a clear margin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He has always promised to do that, it was just a matter of whether he delivered," said Size. "I'd been thinking about blinkers for him last season when he first got into Group company, when he started to looked as though he was intimidated or not focusing when he was beaten a couple of times. But I decided not to because he was racing well despite it."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But after a sound defeat at the hands of the Horse of the Year first-up this season, Size said the Jockey Club Mile would see Glorious Days in blinkers in an effort to narrow the gap between them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, the gap vanished, then turned right around yesterday, with Whyte highlighting how switched on Glorious Days had been in the straight as he dashed away from Ambitious Dragon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I always thought, in the last four runs, that he would need blinkers. It has been frustrating in a sense riding him because, in the early days, his brilliance won him races and he could afford to make mistakes," Whyte said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the last few have been frustrating because he's been coming through, giving me this amazing feeling and then hitting a flat spot, like he's lost concentration, and it's gone. Today he just travelled so sweetly, and when I've pressed the button, he's taken up the slack and taken up the gap that I wanted and just been a man about it. Full credit to John - he has thought about the blinkers for a while too but he said you can put them on the wrong day and the horse overraces and then you've lost him. He decided today was the important day, the right day."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size now has a serious favourite in the Hong Kong Mile for the fourth time, with Electronic Unicorn (twice) and Armada all finishing second in the past, and he admitted after this win that he wasn't expecting any further improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think you could ask for more than his effort today," he said. "It's a pretty big run going into a big race, which is always a discomfort, but he's got three weeks to get over it. If he just repeated that run, that would be enough. To ask him to step up again would be too much."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Millard had been toying with a choice between the Hong Kong Cup and Mile next month, but declared his hand rather than any extreme disappointment yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Second run in, that's what I feared - a flat run like last year. First-up, he ran 1 minute 33s and change with 133 pounds on his back and this time they've run 1 minute 34 seconds and he's been beaten," Millard pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"You've just got to take it. This time there five pounds between them, and next time there's no pounds. I've spoken to his owner, and it looks like we'll go the Mile. We've just got to move forward and I'd rather have a flat run now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jockey Zac Purton echoed the trainer's view and said Ambitious Dragon was a different horse second-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Last time he towed me into the race, then dashed away. Today he towed me up but as soon as I went for him, he was flat," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think there's a great deal between him and Glorious Days, though, and the five pounds that made a difference today could make a difference next time."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, the former Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has joined online lender WeLab as a senior adviser, the second top minister to join the budding fintech sector in as many months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining WeLab is Chan's first major private sector commitment since he left the government in July last year after serving in the post for 10 years. He has since returned to academics as an adjunct professor of finance with the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 61, has taken a path similar to former financial secretary, John Tsang Chun-wah, who was defeated last year in his bid to become the city's chief executive, and in June joined fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific as vice-chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan declined to reveal his salary for his role in WeLab, which he took up on July 6 but was only made public on July 16.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said this was not a full-time job and that he could advise other fintech companies as well while continuing to teach at the university. At WeLab he will only help with setting out strategy and will not be involved in the day to day operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I taught at the university in the first part of my career. Then I joined the government for 10 years as a minister. Now I think it is right time for me to open a new chapter in my career in fintech,”Chan said WeLab's office in Sheung Wan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I always promoted fintech when I was in the government. During the past 12 months at the university, my focus has also been on financial technology and start-ups. By joining WeLab, it gives me a chance to put academic theory about financial technology into use,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's decision to join WeLab has a lot to do with his faith in co-founder Simon Loong.The home-grown unicorn - which has a valuation of US$1 billion - will be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), Loong told the Post in an exclusive interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority is now accepting application from new players to set up virtual banks which purely offer services online without any physical branches.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The online lender last week filed an application to list on the main board of Hong Kong stock exchange.Brokers speculate it may raise US$500 million, although the company has not made any comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a start-up which uses big data and other new technology to approve and handle loan approval. It is full of young staff below 30 years old. I like to work with young colleagues to try something new,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said fintech development in Hong Kong has taken huge strides since the HKMA brought in a range of measures last September to promote banks to use new technology to cut costs and enhance their services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chan was in government, e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014 opted for listing in New York instead of Hong Kong as the city at the time did not accept dual-class shareholding companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April implemented massive listing reforms to attract dual-class shareholding companies and biotech tech firms without revenue to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We did all want Alibaba to list here but our regulations would not let that happen. There was no regret as we had to follow the regulations at the time. We do hope after the listing reform of HKEX, we can now attract many of the unicorns to list in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's successful listing marks the beginning of an era for multiple class shareholding companies to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, said it was a positive move for a former minister to join the fintech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fintech is a hot topic in town and has a lot of room for development,” Cheung said. “It will be good to have these experienced government officials join the fintech industry as this will help forge closer ties between the public and private sector and promote Hong Kong as a smart city.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American Restaurant, a Hong Kong institution for more than half a century, has closed. Hoardings went up a few months ago for “renovations”, a telltale sign that it might not reopen, and now there is signage that another restaurant is replacing it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a go-to place for big groups of diners, mostly expatriates keen to indulge in large plates of food washed down with bottles of Tsingtao beer. The waiters, who looked jaded and would have been in their sixties, were accustomed to inebriated and boisterous guests and to taking orders in English for the restaurant's northern Chinese fare.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the American Restaurant's most memorable dishes were the Peking duck - which arrived at your table already sliced and accompanied by the giant steamed pancakes in which to wrap the meat. The duck was on the oily side, but as the health-conscious didn't walk into this place it didn't matter. The minced duck meat was served in a stir-fry wrapped in large cabbage leaves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another was the Mongolian beef pockets, in which dry, shredded (and oily) beef was stuffed into hollow sesame pockets. The beef had a simmering spiciness that slowly fired up the taste buds the more you ate. It was so spicy, and yet so addictive.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most dramatic dish had to be the sizzling Sichuan prawns. When it arrived at the table, the waiter would pour the sauce on top, causing a giant waft of cough-inducing steam. Diners held their napkins over their faces and chests to protect their respiratory tracts and clothes from the sweet and sour sauce flying off the iron-hot platter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once the sizzling died down, the prawns tasted fantastic - large and crunchy, and with a pronounced garlic taste.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even when credit cards became popular, the restaurant didn't accept them, so diners had to bring wads of cash to pay the bill at the end of the evening; some had to run to the nearest ATM, which was blocks away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American Restaurant was often recommended in tourist guides to Hong Kong and travel features about the city, and a visit by Prince Andrew, Duke of York when his </span><span class="s3">Royal Navy</span><span class="s1"> ship was on a port visit in the 1980s may have garnered it some extra publicity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The restaurant was founded in 1950 by Chung Shu-luen, who apparently enjoyed sitting at a table in the corner observing the hustle and bustle of the place. American Restaurant's original location was in Wan Chai Road, near where the Cathay Theatre used to stand. Chung called it American Peking because of the American naval presence, and in Chinese it was called “Mee Lei King”, which sounds a bit like “American”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the building the restaurant was in was scheduled for demolition, Chung moved it to the western end of Lockhart Road, where it remained until its closure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two-storey establishment, with its kitsch decor, never changed much even as the rest of Wan Chai did, which is probably why American Restaurant eventually had to go, after 68 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will be sorely missed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Danny Shum Chap-shing's Hei Hei Posh drops back to his best trip at Happy Valley tomorrow night and can kick-off the Triple Trio in style as a sound banker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hei Hei Posh is a winner over 1,800m at both turf tracks, but it was his brave runner-up effort over 2,200m last start that adds some further confidence in a Class Four Handicap.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tim Clark, who rides again from gate five, was one-off facing the breeze when leader Kensworth Kid slowed to a near-walk down the back, the Australian forced to stride forward with 600m to go. Not surprisingly, Clark found himself in front a long way from home, and it was only a heads-up ride by Tye Angland on Super Strike that saw him nabbed late.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is probably a weaker field. The John Size-trained All Bountiful (Douglas Whyte) has been a hard one for punters to figure out - he heads to the city track for the first time and is stepping up to 1,800 for the first time, too. Both moves create some attraction; he is a strong-enough looking individual, and his speed could make him versatile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take your pick of the rest in a race with a long tail, but Telecom Supremo (Howard Cheng Yue-tin), Glory Of India (Angland) and Goldmen Y Y (Alex Lai Hoi-wing) look logical-enough selections.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle pin is an open race, where Dennis Yip Chor-hong's well-drawn One Of A Kind (Whyte) is a great chance of breaking through at his first try over 1,650m.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From gate three, Whyte can stalk a speed which will depend on whether Gerald Mosse on Real Dragon comes across from gate 10 to challenge last-start winner Home With Glory (Howard Cheng Yue-tin).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One Of A Kind didn't get the clearest run last start and endured a bumping duel late with winner Able Magic - a horse he meets four pounds better off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Able Magic (Zac Purton) also goes in, as does Home With Glory - a recent stable transfer who seemingly has plenty of rating points of improvement left in him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consider double-banking Home With Glory and One Of A Kind - for affordability purposes - as this is a race with a lot of strong place chances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Danzulu (Umberto Rispoli), Magnanimous (Andreas Suborics) and Sugar Pegasus (Derek Leung Ka-chun) all deserve some consideration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final leg contains a clear standout as a banker - Kick Serve (Purton), who has drawn two and handles himself well at this track in this grade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Michael Chang Chun-wai-trained six-year-old has been placed at his only two runs this term, and faces a race without depth. Kick Serve is no world beater, but he can be placed in different spots in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That could be crucial in a race with apparent speed that could drop off sharply if the nominal frontrunners sort themselves into an order early. Purton can sit as far forward, or back, as the pace dictates from that gate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gamekeepers (Whyte) has hit a wall since striking Class Three company, and barrier nine is tough, but a place is possible here. Caspar Fownes' pair Ride On The Fire (Clark) and Jumbo Gold (Vincent Ho Chak-yiu) are the next in - but it drops off sharply from there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TRACK STARS</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Foxconn Industrial Internet</span><span class="s1"> is quickly losing favour among investors only a month after its stellar debut on China's stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The affiliate of </span><span class="s3">Hon Hai Precision Industry</span><span class="s1">, known for assembling iPhones and iPads, is now among the worst-performing initial public offerings in the mainland this year, with its shares down 33 per cent from its peak in June. Its descent was swift, even as analysts had touted the company a unicorn of China's manufacturing industry, and the regulators fast-tracked the approval process for the flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These privileges were not enough to convince investors like Hengsheng Asset Management, which said the stock was more overvalued than its main customer Apple, or </span><span class="s3">Midea Group</span><span class="s1">, a comparable industry giant that is also making its foray into smart manufacturing. Foxconn Industrial's ambition to turn itself into a smart manufacturer that offers businesses from cloud computing service to precision gadgets and industry robots also had a long way to go, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foxconn unit soars by maximum 44pc in Shanghai trading debut, giving it a US$61b value[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2149856/foxconn-unit-soars-maximum-44pc-shanghai-trading-debut-giving]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We simply view the company as a traditional assembler that has low profit margins and its plan to develop smart manufacturing is still in the storytelling stage,” said Dai Ming, a Hengsheng Asset fund manager in Shanghai. “And the size of the company is already pretty big, and it's impossible for the market to give it a valuation premium like smaller growth companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foxconn Industrial is now valued at 339.4 billion yuan (US$51.1 billion) after raising 27.1 billion yuan in the mainland's biggest IPO sale in three years. Its market capitalisation is 50 times as big as the average size of the 729 companies on the ChiNext board for growth stocks. Its shares added 1.6 per cent to 17.23 yuan at the close in Shanghai on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foxconn unit gets green light to start fundraising for US$4.3 billion IPO, China's biggest in three years[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2146000/foxconn-unit-gets-green-light-start-fundraising-us43-billion-ipo]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expectations had been high for its post-IPO stock performance as Chinese regulators unveiled a slew of favourable policies to woo home listings of fast-growing technology companies. Foxconn Industrial waited only 27 days before its IPO application was vetted by regulators, against the 500-plus days for regular IPO candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even after a 33 per cent drop from its all-time high, the company is still valued at 19.2 times estimated earnings for this year, making it pricier than Apple that has a multiple of 16.1 times, according to Bloomberg data. The stock is also 32 per cent more expensive than Midea, China's biggest appliance maker that has already made a concrete step in entering smart manufacturing by acquiring a major stake in Kuka, the world's larger producer of robots used to make cars.We simply view the company as a traditional assembler that has low profit margins and its plan to develop smart manufacturing is still in the storytelling stageDai Ming, Hengsheng Asset Management</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A breakdown on Foxconn Industrial's current sources of revenues does not seem to justify its valuation premium. Manufacturing of phone equipment made up 61 per cent of its sales in 2017, while the proportion of industry robots was less than 0.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market has doubt over how much real hi-tech the company has on hand,” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai. “And its smart manufacturing plan is still the wild card.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sell-side analysts have been slow in adjusting their rating on the stock and the share-price estimates. All the six brokerages including </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> and Ping An Securities that cover the stock, according to Bloomberg, rate the stock a “buy”, setting an average 12-month price target of 22.16 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hengsheng Asset's Dai said Foxconn Industrial would be more reasonably priced at below 15 yuan, which indicates a minimal 13 per cent drop from Friday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market is always right,” said Shanshan Finance's Wu. “There's probably more room for downside on the stock.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With their rosy cheeks, golden horns and cascading purple manes, Anita Caswell Ng Hoi-ying's distinctive unicorn-themed goodies are sure to get the social-media likes rolling in for the students of her Little Miss Macarons baking workshops in Wong Chuk Hang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sitting somewhere between a cake, a biscuit and a meringue, the macaron (not to be confused with the macaroon) originated in medieval Italy before being popularised in France in the 19th century. It has enjoyed a resurgence over the past decade, and Hong Kong baker Caswell Ng's painstakingly decorated and photogenic treats are her signature creations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These days, people need dreams, and unicorns - whether for kids or adults - appeal to people all over the world,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macarons are made by piping meringue and almond-flour mixture into circles and baking at low temperatures before two halves are sandwiched together with jam and butter icing. They are famously tricky to master, especially in a place like Hong Kong, where humidity plays havoc with the egg-white base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then comes the decoration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's very much like a make-up class,” Caswell Ng says. “We put some pearl powder on the macaron like foundation, then use a bronze powder to do the eyes, and then we have pink powder like blush on the cheeks. The hair is made from icing, and the horns and ears are made with fondant.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Food editor Susan Jung shares the secrets of the perfect macaron[https://www.scmp.com/article/713838/sweet-child-mine]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macarons should be savoured slowly to appreciate their flavour, Caswell Ng advises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A good macaron should be slightly crisp on the outside, then, once you bite into it, it's soft and melts in your mouth,” she says. “The filling should give you an aftertaste; it's very much like wine. You bite in, close your eyes and sense a beautiful aftertaste. That's a good macaron.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caswell Ng enjoys teaching others and seeing what variations her apprentices come up with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It takes time, but I love it,” she says. “Seeing people smile makes it all worthwhile.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Little Miss Macarons classes are held at Baking Maniac, in Wong Chuk Hang. Private workshops (for parties of eight to 15 people) cost HK$880 per person and include at least 20 take-home macarons. Visit littlemissmacarons.com[https://littlemissmacarons.com/].</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, China's biggest online health care platform, aims to expand its services in Southeast Asia later this year to cater the growing demand from the region and mainlanders travelling for medical tourism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, officially known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, last Thursday announced the formation of a 70:30 venture with Southeast Asian ride-hailing platform Grab, which will give users in the region access to artificial intelligence-assisted online medical consultations, medicine delivery and appointment bookings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After signing the joint venture agreement, we now need to form the management team,” said Wang Tao, chairman of Ping An Good Doctor. “We hope to see the services in at least one country this year. It is possible Thailand will be the first one.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Thailand is good because of the availability of low-cost, high-quality services provided by private medical centres.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week , a spokeswoman for Grab said that the company is “looking at Indonesia closely”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will also keep an eye on the growing medical tourism market as an increasing number of mainland Chinese looking for international medical services. Wang said they would also cooperate with hospitals in the region to provide online and offline medical services to Chinese users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Medical institutions in Thailand and Indonesia provide good services, and costs are low. And they have a large number of young mobile user population,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia, with a population of about 660 million, has over 200 million mobile users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Ctrip, China's largest online tourism agency, in 2016 over 500,000 outbound medical trips were taken, five times the number in 2015. Average spending was over 50,000 yuan (US$7,286), 10 times the expenditure for individual overseas trips.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Both China and Southeast Asian countries face a shortage of medical services. People in Southeast Asia are willing to pay small amounts for medical consultancy services. I see the market has great growth potential. It will see quicker profit return as we have already built up the infrastructure and Grab has provided a strong network in the region,” Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab has built up a strong network in eight countries and it has more than 20 million monthly active users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's almost half of our monthly active users in China and it also has good relationships with governments in the region,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spun off from </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, China's biggest insurer by market value, Ping An Good Doctor was the first technology unicorn, a start-up valued at over US$1 billion. It listed in Hong Kong in May this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company last week reported its first six-month earnings since going public. Losses narrowed by 2.6 per cent to 444.2 million yuan, while revenue jumped 150 per cent to 1.1 billion yuan from the year-earlier period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said the two companies only took three months to form the joint venture, with help from Masayoshi Son, chief executive of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, Wang said the company was actively exploring diversified forms of partnerships with insurance companies and could form the first one with its parent </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> this year, having already built a payment mechanism for companies to settle their policyholders' claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said he has a target to turn the company profitable. But he does not plan to disclose it as new investment opportunities may alter the timetable.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Tony Cruz-trained Green Manner caught the eye with a gutsy debut performance in the Class Three Fa Po Handicap (1,600m) on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The five-year-old launched his career at Sha Tin off a seasoned 10-run campaign in New Zealand under the same name for trainer Graham Richardson, winning twice over 1,400m at Te Aroha and at Pukekura in the North Island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He showed some response when asked for an effort in an all-weather trial, but it was not enough to catch the attention of punters and the gelding was sent out at 24-1 under Matthew Chadwick.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green Manner jumped alertly with a hood and tongue-tie to settle second behind Shiny Day, and then eased back to sit along the fence in fourth behind Soldier at the 1,200m. He switched off the leader at the 400m, rushed to the lead 300m out and stayed on dourly, only to find the progressive Taknam too good in the final 50m.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is son of exposed Danehill Dancer line which has thrived over varying distances on the local front with 37 winners from 66 starters, the best of whom have been smart sprinters One World (Group Two </span><span class="s3">Cathay Pacific</span><span class="s1"> Jockey Club Sprint winner) and Rich Unicorn (successful over Little Bridge in last season's Group Two Premier Bowl) and the middle-distance victorious pair of Super Satin (2010 Derby winner) and Super Pistachio (2011 Queen Mother Memorial Cup winner). His dam, Galileo mare Snapdragon, raced twice in Great Britain and came away fourth on both occasions over 2,400m and 2,600m and is a half-sister to five winners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green Manner appears to have acclimatised quickly and should be saluting over a mile to 2,000m.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Hong Kong artificial intelligence lab backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and SenseTime, the world's most valuable AI start-up, has named seven companies that will receive funding under its accelerator programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong AI and Data Laboratory announced in a ceremony on Thursday that it will provide US$100,000 in seed funding to each of the selected start-ups, who will also be given office space, access to AI resources from Alibaba and SenseTime, and a range of cloud computing services from Alibaba Cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These start-ups not only have innovative technologies and business ideas, but they also offer valuable solutions for different industries and scenarios,” Jeff Zhang, the chief technology officer of Alibaba, said at the ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said it was important to work on the application of AI technologies in different industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lab was established in May by the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund and SenseTime, which became the city's first unicorn - a start-up valued at more than US$1 billion - in July last year. The lab has partnered with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) to launch the six-month accelerator programme to nurture more AI start-ups in the city.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Accelerator programme participant Dayta, a local start-up that offers computer vision and natural language processing solutions to businesses, predicted demand for AI technologies in Hong Kong to grow steadily.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Artificial intelligence has a lot of potential in the market, which is still very much underserved,” Dayta founder and chief executive Patrick Tu said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tu said he made the decision to start Dayta five months ago, while he was setting up an education start-up. Dayta has already broken even with its initial projects, he said. Those included a project that helps retailers monitor customer traffic and another in which a media organisation automatically analyses data in reports.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong AI Lab was established amid the city government's efforts to step up innovation in areas like AI, biotechnology and financial technology to keep pace with developments in major economies. The government's budget for this year included HK$40 billion for HKSTP to support hi-tech innovation. A separate amount of HK$10 billion was earmarked to establish two technology research clusters focusing on health care technology and AI.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is also looking to increase the adoption of mobile payments as it continues to lag behind other economies in Asia, particularly mainland China. Consumers in the city mostly prefer using cash, credit cards, or stored-value card platforms like Octopus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online payment service AlipayHK on Thursday introduced EasyGo, a payment technology that allows users to pay their transport fares by scanning a QR code to complete the transaction in 0.3 seconds, even when both the user and the bus are offline or have poor network connection.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AlipayHK, a joint venture between tycoon Li Ka-shing's </span><span class="s3">CK Hutchison</span><span class="s1"> Holdings and Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services, has teamed up with two of Hong Kong's biggest mini bus operators, </span><span class="s3">AMS</span><span class="s1"> Public Transportation Holdings and Koon Wing Motors, to make EasyGo technology available on their vehicles, according to a statement from the online payment service. It did not provide the specific date when EasyGo will be made available.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Karl Wong, head of product development at AlipayHK, said EasyGo technology will be adopted to other modes of public transport in Hong Kong. He said it was based on a system already being used in densely populated mainland cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While AlipayHK reported having 1.5 million users in Hong Kong as of the end of June, it found the adoption of mobile payments to be an uphill battle amid the city's attachment to more traditional forms of transactions and concerns over data privacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The joint venture also competes against Western payment services like </span><span class="s3">PayPal</span><span class="s1">, local providers like TNG Wallet and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">' </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> Pay.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s on-demand delivery services unit Ele.me plans to expand a </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> coffee delivery service across more Chinese cities as it ramps up competition with a raft of new entrants including beverages upstart Luckin Coffee, which is backed by </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting from October 22, customers in nine new cities will join those in Beijing and Shanghai in being able to receive </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> coffee deliveries direct to their door, courtesy of Ele.me, Alibaba said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> started delivery services in September in Beijing and Shanghai following the announcement of a partnership with Alibaba the previous month. The service is expected to expand to “more than 2,000 stores across 30 cities by the end of the year,” Belinda Wong, chief executive of Starbucks China, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market for on-demand delivery is crucial for Chinese internet giants as it opens up an entry point to other services such as online payments, and also provides further insights into consumer spending patterns. The expansion also comes amid intensifying competition in China with a partnership forged by Tencent and Luckin in September, which leverages the ecosystem of </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, Tencent's dominant messaging, social media and payment app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luckin Coffee confirms US$200m in new funding as it aims for even faster delivery[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2155110/chinas-luckin-coffee-confirms-us200-million-raised-latest-funding]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coffee-and-bakery chain Luckin, which began operations in November 2017, has staked out its claim to be a domestic challenger to </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> in China. “</span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> is a great company and has done tremendously well, especially in educating Chinese consumers about coffee,” said CEO Qian Zhiya earlier this year. “But it does not equal coffee in China and neither is it the sole contender,” she said, adding that all countries have local coffee brands.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 44 per cent of Luckin shops opened as of June were effectively “take-out kitchens”, according to the company, which delivers its coffee using the SF Express delivery firm in less than 20 minutes. The Beijing-based start-up claimed a unicorn-status valuation of US$1 billion after raising US$200 million in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It operates 1,003 physical stores in 13 Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai and has sold 26 million cups of coffee as of September 3. The start-up expects to operate 2,000 stores nationwide by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> and Luckin are vying for a bigger share of a fast-growing coffee market in the world's most populous nation. China's total coffee consumption surged 16 per cent annually in the past 10 years compared to the world's average growth of 2 per cent, according to the </span><span class="s3">International Coffee Organization</span><span class="s1"> in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The coffee shop market in China is estimated to be worth over US$4.5 billion as of last year, thanks to years of booming growth, according to </span><span class="s3">Euromonitor</span><span class="s1"> data. </span><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> is currently China's dominant coffee provider with a market share of about 58.6 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Euromonitor</span><span class="s1">, yet the Seattle-based firm reported a 2 per cent drop in comparable-store sales in China, a rare sales decline for the chain, for the second quarter of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Starbucks</span><span class="s1"> aims to triple revenue in China over the next five years. It also plans to build about 3,000 new stores in the country over the next few years, doubling the current number of 3,300 stores by the end of 2022, according to a company announcement in May.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year saw record deal activity backed by venture capital (VC) in China, with half of the top 10 largest deals globally by Chinese telecoms and internet companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Topping the list was </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">'s US$5.5 billion financing in April, which emerged as the largest VC-backed deal in the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Preqin, a data service provider for the alternative assets industry, expects an uptick in venture capital investors seeking initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Spotify [is expected] to become publicly traded in 2018, and other venture capital-backed companies may follow suit. A number of VC-backed companies have now grown to valuations that would make them unlikely candidates for trade sales to corporates … as such, becoming publicly listed is the most likely exit strategy for these companies,” said Felice Egidio, head of venture capital products at Preqin.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, the Swedish music-streaming service filed for a listing on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Details of the listing are limited, although the company is reportedly seeking a direct listing on the exchange without an initial public offering to raise additional capital.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment deals backed by venture capital reached a record US$182 billion globally in 2017, with the value up 28 per cent compared with 2016, even as the deal count dropped 4.7 per cent to 11,144. The US dominated the rankings, drawing 42 per cent, or more than US$76.4 billion. Greater China ranked No 2, attracting 36 per cent of total deal value, with US$65 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Preqin said the 2017 deal number and value figures are expected to rise by up to 5 per cent as more information become available. In 2016 Chinese start-ups accounted for seven out of the top-10 financing deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US$5.5 billion financing to </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, which is Asia's biggest unicorn - or start-up companies valued at more than US$1 billion - also amounted to the largest Asia-based VC deal on record.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, exits deals backed by venture capital - or the method by which a venture capitalist cashes out of a business - amounted to US$71 billion. Of these, 676 exits amounting to US$51.7 billion were completed in North America. China completed 60 exits valued at US$5.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when it comes to fund raising, 2017 stopped short of being the best record for venture capital. For the year, venture capital funds raised US$55 billion while growth funds raised US$39 billion, both lower than in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ironically, it was Hing Chao's time studying in the West that played a hand in his many projects aimed at preserving and promoting traditional Chinese culture. "I was born in Hong Kong, but went to the UK to study, spending my teenage and university years in England. However, my mother thought that my personality had become thoroughly anglicised, which she saw as a problem, so I was sent to Beijing," says Chao, organiser of the ongoing Hong Kong Culture Festival[http://hkculturefestival.com].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sitting at a giant conference table in his Wan Chai office - he works for his family-run shipping firm, the Wah Kwong Group - Chao says that after graduating in philosophy from the University of Durham he spent a year in Beijing, including travels to Inner Mongolia that planted the seeds of a love affair with the cultures of ethnic minorities in the far northeast of China - "the indigenous marginalised peoples in Manchuria … the hunters and gatherers".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2004, he established the Orochen Foundation, a non-profit charity aimed at preserving the culture, language and identity of minority groups in northeast China, focusing mainly on intangible cultural heritage, aspects that include song, music, dance, drama and festivals, aspects that can be recorded but cannot be touched or stored in physical form.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And his passion for cultural preservation also extends to Hong Kong, where Chao is a major supporter of heritage conservation and martial arts. "Hong Kong didn't pay much attention to historical buildings until 1997, when the change of sovereignty was a marker for how Hong Kong people looked at ourselves and our past."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chao says the turning point came after the demolition of Queen's Pier in 2008, which created an uproar among conservationists, and sparked protests in the city that included then-legislator Law Chi-kwong swimming in Victoria Harbour and a hunger strike by three students at the pier. Other protestors camped at the site.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chao says the backlash took the government by surprise. "The public outcry was highly unexpected," says Chao, who also refers to the 78-year-old King Yin Lei mansion on Stubbs Road, Mid-Levels, as another milestone for heritage conservation. In 2008 the building was spared from the wrecking ball after public pressure forced the government to intervene.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for his favourite heritage building in Hong Kong, Chao says he has many, but a standout is the Blue House in Wan Chai that reflects his love for both heritage buildings and martial arts. "The Blue House is close to me personally," Chao says of the grade one historic building on Stone Nullah Lane that was part of a HK$100 million plan by the Housing Society and the Urban Renewal Authority to preserve nine Chinese-style buildings in the district.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the 1950s, the distinctive blue building houseda martial arts school run by Lam Cho. "I'm a practising martial artist, so I'm mindful of the history of trans-martial arts in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To say Chao loves martial arts is something of an understatement. Obsession is more apt. He has studied several styles of southern Chinese martial arts, holds a second dan black belt in Shotokan-style karate, is a qualified kick-boxing instructor and founder of the Journal of Chinese Martial Studies, the first English-language research periodical focused on the study of Chinese martial arts culture and indigenous sports. In 2008, he co-founded the International Guoshu Association, the only non-profit organisation dedicated to the research and reconstruction of Chinese sports and classical martial arts (he's also the association's chief executive).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2013, Chao co-authored Hung Kuen Fundamentals: Fok Fu Kuen with Lam Chun-fai, the highest authority in hung kuen, a type of kung fu discipline. He says the book aims to keep alive a 300-year-old martial arts style that focuses on deep, low stances and strong hand techniques.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it is Chao's latest project - the Hong Kong Culture Festival, which started last month and runs until October 18 - that could leave the deepest imprint on the city's cultural fabric.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This festival is about promoting and sustaining local intangible cultural heritage through activities centred on martial arts, lion dance, Hakka unicorn dance, contemporary ink wash, Cantonese opera, Taoist music and other local traditions … it's an integrated platform for the traditional culture of Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a platform that is desperately needed if the city is to restore the traditions that were diluted by its colonial past, he says. "While it added another layer of culture to the city, colonialism also diluted local traditions. Hong Kong is deeply anchored in British colonial history … all our institutions are modelled after the British, including our schools, the legal system and the public service. For this reason, traditional culture has existed on the periphery, it was never properly institutionalised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Go to any school and you'll see that the disciplines of maths and science are all modelled after the West. The physical education, too - there is basketball, athletics, rugby. But where are the martial arts? Chinese culture has a certain space in the Hong Kong education system, but it's not an important space."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He says the city's rapid development and modernisation has also resulted in the loss of the old communities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The city's social fabric has become fragmented and because of this displacement and transformation, a lot of traditional customs were removed. We need to construct a new platform - a new showcase for people to understand what Hong Kong heritage is."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through the Looking-Glass: And What Alice Found There by Lewis Carroll Macmillan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Readers familiar with this book's 1865 precursor, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, won't be surprised to find that everything in its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, is topsy-turvy. This even begins with the book's jacket: Lewis Carroll is a pseudonym for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Since the author's identity is not the whole truth, it makes sense that he should have become known as a laureate of nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The very title of this novella provides a clue as to what we are going to encounter: the looking glass reflects to Alice the world as she knows it. But, as a child - able to easily comprehend alternative realities - she reinterprets this world and creates a parallel, magical realist version of her own when she steps through the mirror.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The truth as we know it is suddenly inverted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Within this world, everything is back to front. Alice picks up a book to find the text is reversed in the poem Jabberwocky (a nonsense poem Carroll began before he wrote Through the Looking-Glass). In order to get where she wants to go, she must walk in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reality is parodied: unicorns are incredulous at the idea of a real human being - Alice is described as a "fabulous monster". When Alice cuts a cake, the unicorn tells her looking-glass cakes should be handed around first and cut after. Sure enough, the advice works. For in this world, events precede actions. Crimes are punished before they are committed, and fingers feel pain before they are pricked. Logic and ideas are inverted, often through riddles and word puzzles spoken by personified objects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alice is at first confused by all this nonsense, and the White Queen tells her it's "the effect of living backwards". Carroll challenges his readers to invert their perceptions of reality and enter the world of the child, the imagination, the dream, in order to make sense of his nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only by accepting this version of reality can the book be truly appreciated, just as Alice herself becomes more accustomed to the strangeness she encounters. In the looking-glass world, she is a pawn in a chess game, trying to reach the eighth square to become a queen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just as in dreams, the action jumps seamlessly from a wood, to a shop, to a boat. With his protagonist at the mercy of unseen forces, maybe Carroll is suggesting we all are victims of a predetermined fate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But finally Alice awakes from this dream world, and Carroll provides an epilogue in the form of a poem that suggests life itself is a kind of dream. Carroll, in his perpetually avuncular tone, asks us to rethink. We should remember that we have the ability not only to look at our true selves in a mirror, but also within ourselves - and also perhaps even trust the nonsense of dreams.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inspired by the huge success of companies that make a business out of sharing cars and housing, China is going through a bout of a sharing boom, with increasing number of seemingly shareable products and services, from bicycles to power banks, to baby strollers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As many as 600 million people were involved in activities related to China's sharing economy last year, with transactions estimated at US$500 billion, according to the State Information Centre. Economic activity around sharing could account for as much as 10 per cent of China's gross domestic product by 2020, the centre said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What the report didn't specify is its definition of the “sharing economy” in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sharing economy typified by </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> or Uber, both of which now have market capitalizations in the billions is becoming China's latest business fad. However, the concept in China might differ from </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> or Uber's definition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Not many of those companies belong truly in the sharing economy,” said Tan Jing , investor and one of the founding members of Uber China. “The sharing economy is a trade-off between private individuals. It's a way to make the most of the social surplus.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's three dozen bicycle sharing services, with their ride-anywhere and park-anywhere business model, uses the public space as their parking spots, which increases management cost for the government and sometimes even cause inconvenience for the public, so they're “not the real essence of the sharing economy,” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many pedestrians and local governments might agree. The boom in bike sharing services across the mainland has generated complaints about illegal parking, traffic violations and dumped cycles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Profiting at the cost of public resources is not the only problem. How many of those “sharing economy” companies are profitable is still a question.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When we talk about sharing economy, we have to think about what has the lowest use ratio and highest price. Only those who fit the criteria have actual sharing value,” said Pan Shiyi, chairman of SOHO China. “If you start to share cheap things like umbrellas and power banks, the concept of sharing economy is distorted.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That might partly explain why the pioneer of the business model was usurped by the pretender, as Uber's China business was bought out by Didi-Chuxing, after burning through billions of dollars in the market. </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post, owns 6 per cent of Didi. The ride-sharing company is valued at US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's taxi price is relatively low, and Uber didn't have much competitive advantage in China,” said Tan. “That's why the real car-sharing companies can only survive in countries like the United States where taxi fares are much higher.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of the trendy sharing companies in China are in fact rental businesses, Tan said. “Didi has more taxi companies on its platform than private car owners. It's more like an online car-hiring company now,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So why do startups want to pass themselves off as sharing economy businesses? That's because venture capital and angel investors love the buzzword.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Successful business like Didi has a strong demonstration effect,” said Shu Huan, chief executive of venture capital database company VC Smart. “The investor might not be genuinely interested in this ‘sharing economy' project, but they don't want to miss out the next Didi.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By packaging themselves as a sharing economy, some startups are offering themselves to investors as the chance to get in on the next unicorn, as companies with at least US$1 billion in valuation are called.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When you say you are a rental company, investors compare you with the library, or traditional car hiring firms. But when you say you are a sharing-economy company, they will compare you with </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">. That's called comparable company valuation, and it got many start-ups valued at a much higher price than they worth,” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">VC Smart data shows 23 per cent of the 329 “sharing economy” startups have been financed, which is much higher than ventures in other fields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past month, three umbrella sharing startups have raised several million yuan from investors, even as doubts remain as to how their business models work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, those startups still have their business value even if they can't make any profits for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The online market is quite mature now. The cost of getting a new user online is not much cheaper, sometimes is even more expensive, than attracting a new customer offline,” said Shu. “Business like bike-sharing or umbrella-sharing can be a good way to catch new customers offline and direct the new traffic to their online or other profitable businesses.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ofo, one of China's biggest bike-sharing companies, has raised a US$700 million Series E funding round led by Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent, which operates China's largest social media network, led a US$600 million financing round of another bike-sharing startup Mobike. By asking bike hirers to use Alipay or Wechat as payment methods, the much smaller but highly popular bike rental companies have become an efficient channel to attract new customers for those online giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maybe some companies should call themselves ‘sharing economy,' but the real opportunities are not in sharing anyway,” said Shu. “Rental business has a lot of more potential to explore in China.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Chinese developers paid a record HK$16.86 billion (US$2.17 billion) for a plot of residential land at Ap Lei Chau, topping market valuations by almost 50 per cent, making it Hong Kong's most expensive lump-sum sale to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A land parcel measuring 126,500 square feet (11,752 square metres) was sold by tender to Unicorn Bay (Hong Kong) Investments, according to the Land Department's data. The buyer is a venture between Logan Property Holdings[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=3380&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] of Shenzhen, and Guangzhou-based KWG Property Holding .[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1813&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With total gross floor area of 762,091 sq ft , the price translates to HK$22,118 per square foot in land cost. Property agents expect apartments on the site to sell for at least HK$32,000 per sq ft, a record for the district.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ap Lei Chau, Cantonese for “duck's tongue peninsula,” is a small island connected by a bridge to the south of Hong Kong island, near the Aberdeen fish market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sale is the government's largest lump-sum sale, exceeding the HK$11.82 billion fetched in 1997 for a Siu Sai Wan site that's now home of the Island Resort.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The record price undermines the assertion by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying that a November 2016 policy to raise the stamp duty for individual second-home buyers to 15 per cent had “achieved its goal” in deterring speculative buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First-time buyers made up 95 per cent of January's residential property sales, while home sales requiring a double, or 15 per cent, stamp duty plunged 83 per cent to 406 transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These figures show the government's efforts to suppress investment demand for flats have been effective,” Leung said this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from bolstering the government's coffers, buoyant land sales boost overall market sentiment and encourage apartment owners to raise their selling prices, property analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government should speed up the release of more land for sale to stabilise the housing market, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The aggressive bidding shows that developers outside Hong Kong see the city's property market as an attractive place to invest in, taking into account the limited new land supply and well established property transaction system,” said Lau Chun-kong, head of the valuation department at property consultant JLL. “The government must increase land supply if they hope to maintain a healthy and stable housing market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's land supply for private housing will be enough for almost 32,000 flats in 2017, surpassing targets for the fourth year, the government said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government plans to sell 28 plots of land for private housing in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, and will provide almost 19,000 flats, with the remainder coming from railway property, urban renewal and private redevelopment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That supply is still not enough, making it hard for buyers to find apartments, Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ap Lei Chau site, expected to become a luxury residential property enclave, won't immediately affect the price of mass housing, but it'll boost the overall market sentiment, said Alvin Lam, director of Midland Realty's valuation department.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese developers will continue to snap up prime sites in Hong Kong, paying a premium to squeeze out local builders, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, the Chinese conglomerate that owns </span><span class="s3">Hainan Airlines</span><span class="s1">, paid a total of HK$20 billion to buy three parcels of land at Hong Kong's former Kai Tak airport in three months through January.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The raging cut-throat competition in China's power bank sharing sector will knock out some small players before a stable competitive landscape emerges this year, say industry players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector is also growing at an exponential pace, with the influx of capital inflows from internet giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed industry player Xiaodian has begun operations in 33 cities in just about three months since the company came into the market on March 12.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We'd probably be in 144 cities, if you ask me for the data a month later, “ said Tang Yongbo, founder of Xiaodian, arguably the market leader for power bank rental that has raised a total of 450 million yuan (US$66 million), by far the biggest amount in the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rival Ankerbox said the ferocious battle to grab market share came earlier than expected, and to a large part due to the capital inflows from China's internet giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In order to not miss the business opportunities, most internet leaders are taking a proactive approach with early investment in these start-ups,” said Yuan Yuan, CEO of the Shenzhen-based power bank rental firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland media reported that an estimated 1.2 billion yuan from 35 venture capital firms have already poured money into the power bank sharing business by April.In order to not miss the business opportunities, most internet leaders are taking a proactive approach with early investment in these start-upsYuan Yuan, Ankerbox</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With ample capital available, Ankerbox said it now operated in 20 cities and would cover all Chinese tier-one and tire-two cities by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market for power banks sharing is potentially massive given the huge number of mobile phone users in China and their long hours of usage . iResearch data shows that Chinese users on average spend nearly 3 hours a day on their smartphones for social networking, viewing videos and shopping online.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The major players said they were are also eyeing the global market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are planning to step into overseas markets; cities with big population and smartphone users, and with developed online payment system will be our first choice, “ Yuan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On home turf though, the stiff competition was expected to force out weaker players, market players said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The players in power bank sharing sector will be quickly reshuffled with the influx of capital inflows, and we will see a stable competitive landscape in the second half of the year, “ said Allen Zhu Xiaohu, managing director and partner at GSR Ventures and an investor of Xiaodian.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What we care most in an investment are two factors: how often are customers willing to use it [product] and how it will make money,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At present, the battle for market share has resulted in price war with the likes of Xiaodian slashing the rental fee to 1 fen per usage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The main purpose of lowering prices is to attract customers to learn about and try the new products,” said Xiaodian's Tang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Subsidies are common in the internet industry and I think it is just a way to attract the customers to adopt to the new kind service quickly,” said Ankerbox's Yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For decades, aspiring entrepreneurs all over the world have looked to Silicon Valley to find inspiration for the next big idea in technology. On the other side of the Pacific, China has worked hard to encourage company founders to set up shop, but Beijing's strict internet controls don't appeal to the open minded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now, instead of shunning China because of its censorship restrictions, some adventurous entrepreneurs are seeing opportunities behind China's Great Firewall, where an isolated market with more than 750 million internet users and abundant venture capital create fertile soil to turn start-up ideas into reality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of those adventurous is Grant Long, Silicon Valley born and bred, who moved to Shanghai late last year to set up a business that provides personalised digital expressions, such as animated GIFs and Emoji, to Chinese consumers who use a set of digital communication tools that are different from the rest of the world.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Great Firewall makes China a closed internet ecosystem.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Critics argue that true innovation cannot flourish in a country that stifles free of speech and limits access to information, but China proves to be the exception to that rule. In fact, censorship and an isolated internet are often the spark behind many of the country's tech and innovation breakthroughs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, China is already a world leader in online shopping applications and mobile payments thanks to its role as the world's biggest e-commerce market. In mobile internet applications, the country's tech firms are taking the lead in enabling consumers to order food and rent shared bikes with just a few swipes on a smartphone. Moreover, the world's second largest economy has been ramping up efforts to create the next Silicon Valley by introducing favourable policies and tax breaks for the tech sector.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, none of this changes the fact that China's internet environment is cut off from the rest of the world. In fact, the central government has been imposing tighter controls on virtual private networks which give people on the mainland access to banned websites that include </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">New York Times</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Justin Ren, an associate professor at Boston University, said the Great Firewall may have offer some benefits in terms of keeping foreign competition out of China, but it also has long-term detrimental effects.That gives us the opportunity to use our Western perspective to come up with something tailored to the digital communication demands of ChinaGrant Long, BiaoqingYun</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For one thing, people are not getting the full information on what exactly other innovative countries are doing. In today's information age, having partial information equals weaker competitive advantage," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Industry insiders say the restrictions on foreign search and social media in China over the past decade have enabled mainland internet giants like Baidu and Tencent to grow into what they are today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But this phenomenon is mostly over now. Chinese internet companies can now compete with foreign internet companies on ability," said Jeffrey Towson, an investment professor at China's elite </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> would get very far in China today, and most foreign smartphone companies, including Apple and </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1">, are really struggling against Chinese competitors."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There weren't really any limits that protected Didi against Uber last year and they won handily. Chinese internet companies can beat you fair and square," he said, adding that in most cases the Great Firewall is more for security concerns and political sensitivity, not to protect the emergence of national champions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment going into China's start-ups is growing steadily and access to funds remains a strong attraction for entrepreneurs, both domestically and internationally. So far in 2017, 41 global technology companies have reached unicorn status, defined as privately held companies valued at more than US$1 billion, according to US research firm CB Insights. Most are in still in the US, but China has seen 15 new unicorns form this year while Europe has five.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What's more, Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, have invested in 46 per cent of all China's unicorns, according to CB Insights. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Yi Jingping, a computer science graduate who co-founded a retail discount platform company two years ago, said he still wants to build his own business despite the challenges of accessing banned content. "The conditions for starting up a company in Beijing are more than perfect," Yi said. "There are many people that have had success around me. It's easy to get funds."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi often seeks inspiration from accessing sites that may be blocked in China. "For a technician, the ability to get around the firewall is a basic skill. I don't think [internet censorship] has a big impact [on what I do]."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But China's heavy handed approach to regulating the internet may be hardest on firms that have foreign clients. Some consider China's new cyber security law, which requires personal information and data collected or generated in China to be stored on the mainland, a major concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Already you need to have data on local servers here, but this could impact moving more of that business locally from abroad," said Stewart Philips, Asia-Pacific business development manager for Event Bank, a cloud-based management platform based in Beijing. "For some things, organisations and companies are happy to comply because the cost of operating and doing business in China is lower. But at a certain point with data it gets a bit trickier because this is sensitive information."</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dapper Boy was his own worst enemy last term, but returns as a seemingly more composed individual and should be able to settle in behind a suitably fast speed at Sha Tin on Monday after showing some encouraging signs of relaxing in a barrier trial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The David Hall-trained four-year-old can act as a banker in the final leg of the Triple Trio at the National Day meeting, a low draw adding confidence to his claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his first season of racing, Dapper Boy was well-supported in his three starts, but needed the experience as his tendency to overrace brought him undone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 1,050m trial, where Weichong Marwing restrained the solid sprinter out of the gates, wasn't perfect, but it did seem an improvement on the hefty gelding's previous intractably green efforts. Best of all, Dapper Boy charged home without any urging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A hot tempo should help Marwing settle Dapper Boy from gate five. Bear Elite, who is first up and with aggressive Matthew Chadwick aboard, should find the front, and Vincent Ho Chak-yiu should reprise his last-start tactics on The Prince from a wide barrier. Throw the two claiming apprentices into the mix - Alvin Ng Ka-chun on Solar Up and Dicky Lui Chek-yeung kicking up from gate one on Ming Hoi Glory - and Dapper Boy won't have any chance to overrace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next in is Holyangelholy (Tye Angland) - with blinkers on and dropping back to 1,200m after an infuriating display as favourite last time out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holyangelholy was a devilish ride for Douglas Whyte, showing surprisingly erratic racing manners and perhaps as a result, was flat-footed and one-paced when they dashed. He, too, will be helped by solid sectionals and the ever-thoughtful Size isn't frivolous about his gear changes, nor anything he does with a horse, so it's fair to expect improvement with the move to shades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a race that drops away sharply, Bear Elite should be forward and will run a race, while Nightlign (Zac Purton) should improve off his first-up run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first leg is up the straight and at first glance the obvious banker seems to be Castle Hero (Ho) after a solid first-up run behind Dane Patrol last weekend, but persistent lameness issues for a horse on a seven-day back-up leave some doubts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drawing one could also leave him facing the breeze as he was last start and doing all the work in the run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oriental Prosper, a first-up winner last season and with Ng's claim bringing him down to a similar weight, gets the cover of the grandstand rail and is an option as a banker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead of standing one out, maybe play narrow with four, including Castle Hero, Oriental Prosper, Bould Mover (Chadwick) and Flying Smart (Brett Prebble), whose first-up fifth was better than it looks on paper. An outsider to consider is one from the trials - Keen Tactics (Eddie Lai Wai-ming).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle leg looks like Lui's best chance of breaking through for his first win on Cosmo One - but drawn inside him are two other on-pace runners that won't make it easy for him to get the rail or a two-wide spot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Include Cosmo One, who is well-treated with the 10-pound allowance, but go for Purton on Meridian Treasure as a banker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drawn six, Purton has the one-dimensional Ferrabosco outside him and can disrupt the big grey's rhythm and then find a perfect spot just behind the speed. Kensworth Kid (Olivier Doleuze) peaked on his run last start after being asked to sprint early.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He will be better for that run and will appreciate any pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Others to consider are Breeze Of Luck (Marwing) and Kingston Spartacus (Lai), with Global Fame (Richard Fourie) a place chance despite his wide draw.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thousands of cups of Hong Kong's "silk-stocking" milk tea will be served to visitors at an exhibition in Taiwan showcasing the city's cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Intangible cultural heritage will take centre stage at Hong Kong Week 2014 in Taipei, the third annual showcase presented by the Hong Kong-Taiwan Cultural Cooperation Committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The October 17 to November 2 exhibition will feature 480 items that best represent the Hong Kong community and provide cultural continuity. "We can showcase Hong Kong history, tradition, personality and local products," said committee convenor Fredric Mao Chun-fai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previous Hong Kong Week exhibitions have featured contemporary art, music, design and dance. This year's event would feature a mix of serious and lighthearted attractions, Mao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chau Hing-wah, curator of the </span><span class="s3">Heritage Museum</span><span class="s1">, told the South China Morning Post the exhibition would feature items of cultural heritage not included in </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">'s list or the national list, but which were on the city's inventory, such as Hong Kong-style milk tea. Hong Kong's inventory was announced in June and was drawn up following passage of a UN convention on safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simon Wong Ka-wor, chairman of the Association of Coffee and Tea of Hong Kong - which runs the International Kam Cha, or milk tea, competition to pick the master milk tea brewer - said Mok Pui-ling, last year's champion, would make 2,000 cups of milk tea at the exhibition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The association estimates Hongkongers drink 2.5 million cups of milk tea per day at nearly 10,000 milk-tea outlets in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said Hong Kong-style, silk-stocking milk tea - named because it is served strained through a cloth bag similar to women's tights - was nearly a century old and had a very different taste from "bubble milk tea".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Few places in Taiwan serve Hong Kong-style milk tea," Wong said. "It is still something very new to the Taiwanese."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the association would be sponsoring materials for the demonstrations in Taipei, including equipment, paper cups, tea leaves, milk and sugar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will provide enough to supply about 2,000 cups," he said. "This is a great opportunity - not just to promote the cultural heritage of Hong Kong, but also to help brand the city."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other heritage items on show at the exhibition, covering more than 1,000 square metres, will include a Unesco-listed Cantonese opera performance and a bamboo theatre, as well as a six-metre King of Ghosts paper statue, one of the icons of the Cheung Chau Bun Festival - which is on the national heritage list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unesco-listed herbal tea will also be presented, alongside the Tai Hang fire dragon dance, Tai O dragon boat water parade and Yu Lan Ghost Festival, which all feature on the national list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chau said a number of items for which national listing was sought last year would feature in the exhibition, including Hong Kong Quanzhen temples, Taoist ritual music, Wong Tai Sin beliefs and customs, the production technique for the seven-stringed guqin instrument, and a Hakka unicorn dance.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, China's ride hailing giant, may be slowing down its plan to raise funds and could be considering an IPO in the second half of next year partly because the need for fresh financing has been less pressing, according to people familiar with the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Didi was actively seeking to raise fresh capital by issuing US dollar convertible bonds, a type of debt security that can be converted into stock, but Didi is now slowing down its fundraising moves partly because competitor </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping has also been easing back on the expansion of its ride hailing business, said the people familiar, who declined to be identified because the information is private.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financing plans are fluid though and can change on market conditions, the people familiar said. A Didi spokeswoman declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, China's largest provider of on-demand online services, and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> are two of China's most valuable unicorns, with valuations of US$30 billion and US$56 billion respectively based on their latest venture capital fundraising rounds last year. Last month, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> filed an application for an IPO in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment Banks are working on the fundraising plans for Didi and </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and have set up separate teams to keep the two companies' information confidential as they are competitors, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi are among Chinese Internet companies that are building online platforms for services as they seek to make their apps more sticky for users. This trend of building everyday apps where Chinese Internet giants are doing everything is one of the trends identified in the China Internet Report [https://www.abacusnews.com/china-internet-report/] co-authored by the Post, Abacus and 500 Startups and released this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ride-hailing king Didi now wants to help cities solve traffic jams [https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2154027/chinas-biggest-ride-hailing-platform-wants-crunch-its-data-improve]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi did not start out as direct rivals. In 2010, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> was founded by serial entrepreneur Wang Xing as China's answer to Groupon, the US discount e-commerce player, while in 2012, Didi was established by former Alibaba employee Cheng Wei as China's answer to Uber, the US ride hailing giant. Before 2016, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi were barely competitors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between 2012 and 2016, Didi got busy strengthening its presence in the cash-burning ride hailing business in China, which saw it acquiring rivals Kuaidi and Uber China. Didi became the dominant ride-hailing giant in China, and handled more than seven billion rides last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During that time, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> was gradually expanding into various businesses including food delivery, dining, local listings and online travel. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> merged with Dianping in 2016, which was then a local listing and restaurant review firm, taking a 50 per cent stake in the new company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s recent filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s founding members, Wang Xing, Mu Rongjun and Wang Huiwen, together hold dominant voting rights over 59 per cent of </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only at the end of 2016, when Wang Xing personally participated in the series C financing for China's bike sharing firm Mobike for an undisclosed amount, did </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Didi begin to square off in the mobility sector. Months before Wang's interest in Mobike, Didi poured tens of millions of dollars into Ofo, Mobike's major rival in China's hot dockless bike sharing sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last February, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> started to touch upon the ride hailing business by initiating trials in Nanjing. This March, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> announced it was entering the ride hailing sector in Shanghai. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> said it gained 30 per cent of the ride hailing market with a peak of 300,000 daily orders in Shanghai within its first three day of operations. Numbers were helped by heavy subsidies to both ride hailers and drivers. The price to take a ride with </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> can be no more than 5 yuan (US$0.75), while it should be at least 14 yuan (US$2) with a taxi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan unveils US$2.9bn loss as it prepares investors for long haul in IPO filing [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2152287/meituan-unveils-us29bn-loss-it-prepares-investors-long-term-hong-kong-ipo]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> declined to comment on how much cash it set aside for ride subsidies in Shanghai and Nanjing. A Meituan spokesman said the rationale behind its move into ride hailing was that “local transport is a core service in the everyday lives our customers … We are evaluating the synergies that ride hailing services can bring to our platform, including higher user stickiness.” And the ride hailing business is “not a competition just based on subsidies,” according to the spokesman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s potential IPO investors have a different way of thinking though. “</span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> relies heavily on subsidies to maintain and get more market share for their ride hailing, food delivery, online travel agency and other sprawling businesses,” said Alex Au, managing director of Alphalex Capital Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If new competition emerges, </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will need to burn more money to keep market share. How many sticky users they can maintain remains a question no one can answer,” said Au.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s other major move to bolster its transport business was the full acquisition of Mobike, the Beijing-based bike sharing unicorn, for US$2.7 billion in April this year. Didi meanwhile, took over the operations of smaller bike sharing company Bluegogo at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> hasn't expanded its ride hailing business further into any other major Chinese cities. “One of the resistance points </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> might face is from transport regulators, especially for operating licences,” said Xue Yu, analyst at research firm IDC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's Meituan in US$2.7 billion deal to buy bike-sharing firm Mobike [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2140187/chinas-meituan-buys-bicycle-sharing-firm-mobike-mobility-push]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April this year, Didi answered back by starting a food delivery business — a market where </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba-owned Ele.me have dominated. IDC's Xue described this as a “defensive move” from Didi. Didi said its food delivery platform received 334,000 orders on its launch day in Wuxi, southern Jiangsu province in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi's food delivery business now operates in four cities - Wuxi, Nanjing, Taizhou and Chengdu, again using heavy subsidies to reduce the price of a typical order to as low as two yuan (US$0.3).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's always better for customers when there's a new player entering the food delivery business. And Didi's entry will provide more of a counterbalance to the industry,” said Xie Pu, a Changsha-based technology columnist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Didi and </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> have been loss-making. In </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s prospectus, the company reported an adjusted net loss of 2.85 billion yuan last year, 5.35 billion yuan in 2016 and 5.91 billion yuan in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s net loss has narrowed in recent years, the Hong Kong market may not quite be ready to welcome loss-making companies in the same way that the US market does.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the eve of what could possibly be the world's biggest initial public offering this year, has the fizz gone out of Hong Kong's market?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 87 companies that raised funds in the city this year, 53 per cent of the total traded at prices below their offering prices in their first month of trading, according to Bloomberg data. And 20 companies fell below their offering prices on their trading debut.Investors need to be careful, as it's unclear if all these listings can be digested by the market and receive a positive responseAlvin Cheung Chi-wai, associate director, Prudential Brokerage</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These also included high-profile technology stocks, the very group of new-economy darlings that exchange officials were so convinced would be the future of the bourse that they overhauled the listing rules to accommodate them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overpricing and excessively large fundraising targets are some of the headwinds investors appear to be facing in Hong Kong, especially as many technology and biotechnology companies that go public are still making losses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance, the city's largest technology IPO of 2017, was overbought by 391 times and it's shares soared by as much as 57 per cent within six days of its debut. But it is now trading 17 per cent below its IPO price. Similarly, </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> is trading 50 per cent down from its IPO price, Razer is down 41 per cent and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, also known as Good Doctor, is down by 21 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In this climate, how Xiaomi's US$10 billion IPO - expected next month - fares could determine how attractive Hong Kong's newly overhauled equity market might seem to other Chinese unicorns considering large valuations and fundraising. The company is the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, and a lot will be riding on the success of its listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, what does a disappointing performance by past IPOs mean for the city's biggest listing reform in 25 years? In April, the Hong Kong stock exchange began allowing flotations by companies with dual-class shareholding structures and new economy firms from the biotechnology sector that do not have revenue yet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city is gearing up for a pipeline of blockbuster IPOs this year that could amount to about US$40 billion in total, according to some estimates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a stock drops significantly after its IPO, people will ask where the supporting [price] point is,” said Kevin Leung, executive director of investment strategy at Haitong International Securities. “But it is hard to know as this is a whole new business category, with no comparables.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Underwriting banks and IPO sponsors, for a fee ranging between 3 and 6 per cent of the value of the deal, aim to set reasonable expectations ahead of time and advocate for the well-known “opening day pop” by pricing IPOs at a modest discount to allow about 20 per cent upside on market debut, as an incentive for active trading thereafter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/35f5b7a8-657a-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_191044.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First day trading is often very different from long-term investment performance, as flipping and reselling a hot IPO stock in the first few days to earn a quick profit has increasingly become a practice. Stocks might also often record a downturn with the expiration of their six-month lock-in period, during which pre-IPO investors are prohibited from selling their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when IPOs end up selling below their offering prices within a year, after soaring in the first day or week of trading, then this could be an important indicator of demand being weaker than expected, and could imply that the actual price should have been lower. And if a stock does not record even an opening day pop, this could act as a stronger signal for the relative values of similar companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class listing rules require that companies have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion at listing, or have a market capitalisation of at least HK$10 billion at listing and revenue of at least HK$1 billion in their most recently audited financial year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/2603ddbc-657e-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_191044.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means most companies are likely to be big enough to be included in benchmark indexes soon after their flotation, allowing increased flows to support the stock, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Chinese unicorns considering going public this year seem to be bigger, better-known household names than the ones last year: Lu.com, the online and mobile financial services platform; the ride-sharing giant Didi; </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, a big provider of on-demand online services; </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, the operator of China's biggest online payment platform; and financial technology unicorn WeLab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But scepticism persists: did the projected growth at ZhongAn, Yixin, Razer and Good Doctor justify their high market caps? All four companies are underperforming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as expected interest rate increases by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> are also weighing on market conditions this year, and have triggered fears that money may be sucked out of Asia and into the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors need to be careful, as it's unclear if all these listings can be digested by the market and receive a positive response. Valuations have been aggressive,” said Alvin Cheung Chi-wai, associate director at Prudential Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at SharesPost Research, said Xiaomi's reported gross margin of 13 per cent for 2017 was about three times lower than Apple's 38 per cent, and four times lower than </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1">'s 47 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has performed well in India and needs to replicate this success in Brazil, Indonesia and other developing countries, said Kulkarni.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is rumoured that Xiaomi has persuaded institutional investors in the US and Europe to value its business at no less than US$70 billion, falling back from the US$100 billion initially expected. Based on its 2017 adjusted net profit of about 5.4 billion yuan (US$841 million), this would give the Beijing-based company a price to earnings ratio of 80 to 120 times, well above Apple's 18 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/dc5ca34a-6584-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_191044.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-leader of the National Public Offering Group at Deloitte China, said the maturity of Hong Kong's stock market - because of its large investor base made up of institutional investors - meant it was able to better price an IPO to meet demand. In 2016, 77 per cent of Hong Kong's securities trading was made up of exchange participants and institutional investors, with the remaining 23 per cent coming from retail investors, according to a survey by bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Au said he still expected the Hong Kong IPO market to shrink this year, mainly driven by listings of small and medium-sized companies and biotechnology firms, compared with jumbo listings by Chinese financial institutions in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He forecast the market to continue slipping to about US$20-24 billion in 2018, compared with US$35 billion in 2017, which itself was the smallest amount since the financial crisis in 2008.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wondering what to do on the weekend? With at least 90 different running and multisport races, ranging from one to 173 kilometres long, taking place between now and the end of April next year, there's good reason - whatever your fitness level - to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From road to trail, a leisurely charity walk to speedy competitive runs, an easy loop round the Peak on Hong Kong Island to the challenging Pat Sin Leng ridge in the northeast New Territories, the variety of events is mind-boggling. With trail running alone - arguably the fastest growing sport in Hong Kong in recent years - there are at least 60 events, more than four times than in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are eight races that whet our appetite for running.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lamma 8</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: November 12</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Tai Wan To Beach, Yung Shue Wan, Lamma Island?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 8km run with a mix of concrete and trail</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: a charity run organised by the Child Welfare Scheme, a local charity that supports disadvantaged children and their families, this is the first event of its kind on Lamma. The route goes past the Lamma wind turbine and a scenic mountain trail, before looping back to the start. It's an easy hike for beginners and can be a challenge for runners racing against the clock. The race ends with a beach music festival featuring local bands, food and drinks, market stalls, beach games and children's activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">cwshk.org/NewsandEvents/Lamma8.aspx</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSIG 50 Series - Lantau Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: December 4</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Lantau Island?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 16km, 27km and 50km trail run</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: rub shoulders with some of the region's and world's best trail runners, such as Ultra Trail Mont Blanc champions Caroline Chaverot and Ludovic Pommeret of France in this event that doubles up as the Asian Skyrunning Championships. The race is part of the MSIG 50 Series, which also includes an event on Hong Kong Island (Oct 23) and Sai Kung (Feb 18). The 16km route covers no major peaks, unlike the longer routes, and has a generous six-hour cut-off - ideal if you're just getting started in trail running.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aberdeen Boat Club &amp; Beneteau Four Peaks Race</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: January 21 to January 22, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: all around Hong Kong?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: Asia's ultimate sailing and hill running challenge that covers between 55 to 90 nautical miles (101km to 167km).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: an annual overnight multisport race organised by the Aberdeen Boat Club since 1985, the race brings together the sailing and running community for an endurance feat which takes on average 24 hours to complete. Typically, competitors set off from Tai Tam Bay on the Saturday morning, sailing towards Lantau. There, runners are dropped off in an allocated zone and travel to shore via a small boat or kayak and ascend Lantau Peak (934 metres) on any chosen route, before making their way back to the boat. From there, competitors tackle three more mountains: Mount Steinhouse (353m) on Lamma, Violet Hill (433m) on Hong Kong Island and Ma On Shan (702m) in Sai Kung. The minimum crew is five, with at least two runners climbing each peak.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fat Choy Run</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: January 30, 2017</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: The Peak, Hong Kong Island?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: an 8km road run to usher in the new Lunar Year</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: one of the long-running popular events on the local running calendar, the Year of the Rooster will be the 36th edition. Organised by the Hong Kong Ladies Road Runners Club, the figure-of-eight course starts at the Peak Galleria and passes by this tourist landmark two more times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Kowloon and New Territories?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 50 mile (82km) and 50km trail races, back-to-back</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: Hong Kong's newest ultramarathon is an interesting concept that combines a 50-miler, starting at midnight on the Saturday, and a 50km race on the next day. Both courses will be different, with 200 runners given the chance to compete in both - conquering the legendary "Eight Dragons" of Kowloon: Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill and Crow's Nest. The winner of the race will be crowned the "ninth dragon". Organiser Steve Carr of RaceBase Asia says it will be "the hardest and coolest thing you've ever done in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: a team relay event with a total distance of 26km</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: this new race has a different format - teams of three runners tackle three different loops A (4km), B (4km) and C (5km). First all three runners complete loop A.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: a charity trail race for the entire family with 4km and 8km races for adult-child teams on Saturday, as well as 16km and 42km options on Sunday</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: started in 2015, this is a memorial race for Andy Naylor, a Hong Kong policeman who died while competing at the 2012 Ironman triathlon in New York City. The race goes through the scenic Clearwater Bay Country Park, the trails and roads that Naylor trained on. All profits from the race will go towards investing in running programmes for local children; investing in the local adult running scene; and donating money to any family who has lost a loved one in a running-based event or activity. On Saturday, after the family races, a BBQ and party will be held.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wondering what to do on the weekend? With at least 90 different running and multisport races, ranging from one to 173 kilometres long, taking place between now and the end of April next year, there's good reason - whatever your fitness level - to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From road to trail, a leisurely charity walk to speedy competitive runs, an easy loop round the Peak on Hong Kong Island to the challenging Pat Sin Leng ridge in the northeast New Territories, the variety of events is mind-boggling. With trail running alone - arguably the fastest growing sport in Hong Kong in recent years - there are at least 60 events, more than four times than in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are eight races that whet our appetite for running.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lamma 8</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: November 12</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Tai Wan To Beach, Yung Shue Wan, Lamma Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 8km run with a mix of concrete and trail</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: a charity run organised by the Child Welfare Scheme, a local charity that supports disadvantaged children and their families, this is the first event of its kind on Lamma. The route goes past the Lamma wind turbine and a scenic mountain trail, before looping back to the start. It's an easy hike for beginners and can be a challenge for runners racing against the clock. The race ends with a beach music festival featuring local bands, food and drinks, market stalls, beach games and children's activities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSIG 50 Series - Lantau Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When: December 4</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Lantau Island</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: 16km, 27km and 50km trail run</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: rub shoulders with some of the region's and world's best trail runners, such as Ultra Trail Mont Blanc champions Caroline Chaverot and Ludovic Pommeret of France in this event that doubles up as the Asian Skyrunning Championships. The race is part of the MSIG 50 Series, which also includes an event on Hong Kong Island (Oct 23) and Sai Kung (Feb 18). The 16km route covers no major peaks, unlike the longer routes, and has a generous six-hour cut-off - ideal if you're just getting started in trail running.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: Asia's ultimate sailing and hill running challenge that covers between 55 to 90 nautical miles (101km to 167km).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: an annual overnight multisport race organised by the Aberdeen Boat Club since 1985, the race brings together the sailing and running community for an endurance feat which takes on average 24 hours to complete. Typically, competitors set off from Tai Tam Bay on the Saturday morning, sailing towards Lantau. There, runners are dropped off in an allocated zone and travel to shore via a small boat or kayak and ascend Lantau Peak (934 metres) on any chosen route, before making their way back to the boat. From there, competitors tackle three more mountains: Mount Steinhouse (353m) on Lamma, Violet Hill (433m) on Hong Kong Island and Ma On Shan (702m) in Sai Kung.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where: Clearwater Bay, New Territories</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What: a charity trail race for the entire family with 4km and 8km races for adult-child teams on Saturday, as well as 16km and 42km options on Sunday</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why: started in 2015, this is a memorial race for Andy Naylor, a Hong Kong policeman who died while competing at the 2012 Ironman triathlon in New York City. The race goes through the scenic Clearwater Bay Country Park, the trails and roads that Naylor trained on. All profits from the race will go towards investing in running programmes for local children; investing in the local adult running scene; and donating money to any family who has lost a loved one in a running-based event or activity. On Saturday, after the family races, a BBQ and party will be held.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frankie Lor Fu-chuen's first campaign may be the racing story of the season so far but as much as we want the affable trainer to emulate his mentor John Size and challenge for the championship in year one, he needs to change one key statistic to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For all of Lor's success with the second-hand junk cars he has transformed into Ferraris, he is yet to win with one straight from the showroom floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than half of Lor's 30 wins so far have been in Class Five and while his strike rate in the grade is an extraordinary 43 per cent (16 of 37), these horses can be seen as hand outs to a new trainer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those Class Five wins have come from horses that were clearly under-valued by the handicapper or under-trained by previous handlers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The theory goes that after the Lor polish they have been able to rise close to their correct level in the ratings, he hasn't actually improved them as such, just trained them better. Or, to be more kind to the previous trainers, Lor received them right at the point at which they were going to turn things around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lor has been a revelation, but with around 40 per cent of the season gone there are still a few gaps that need feeling on his resume, the most obvious being the lack of wins with new horses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A grand total of one win - the aptly named New Elegance on December 17 - has come from his horses that hadn't had a previous start with another stable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rattling off wins with stable transfers is a great way for a first year trainer to make a name for himself, but it isn't uncommon either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Back in 2011-12 transfer turnarounds formed the backbone of a solid season for a rookie named Richard Gibson.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Englishman trained 35 winners in his first season, but all but four of them were transfers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's no surprise that the new guy gets the horses nobody else wants, it's not as if a new trainer has many other options early on, as he waits for horses he has sourced himself to acclimatise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And desiring diversity, the Hong Kong Racehorse Owners Association and club officials are no doubt keen for the freshmen handlers to hit the ground running, so steer connections towards the new stables.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the cautionary tale for Lor and those trumpeting him as a future championship contender (yes, hands up, this column pleads guilty on that charge) was what happened next for Gibson.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2011-12 was meant to be the foundation for an upward rise through the ranks for Gibson, and although he has had his fair share of big race success, he hasn't trained as many winners in a single season since.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And just as Gibson turned around transfers like Easy Gold (five wins, 37 points), Great Renown (three wins, up 24 points), Super Caga (four wins, 29 points), Zezao (three wins, 28 points) and Kung Hei Fat Choi (two wins, 14 points) - all but one of whom started in Class Five - the bulk of Lor's success so far has come from picking up somebody else's problems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another similarity between the initial success of Gibson and Lor is that they have both benefited from the retirement of an under-performing veteran local trainer prior to their arrival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Easy Gold, Great Renown and Kung Hei Fat Choi all found a home with Gibson after dropping like a stone in the ratings under the care of Alex Wong Yu-on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just as Gibson put the polish on Wong's rejects, Lor has scooped on some key recruits out of the Gary Ng Ting-keung fire sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yourthewonforme (three wins), Diamond Friends (three) and Furious Pegasus (two wins) all come from Ng's yard and the trio might have more wins in them yet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another challenge for Lor will be when to let go of his Class Five projects. Gibson clung on to too many of his multiple winners. Easy Gold, Great Renown, Zezao, Super Caga and Kung Hei Fat Choi were still with the stable at the start of the following season but none of them were able to win again for the trainer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Letting go is hard to do, but Lor will need to be tough-minded and not waste too much time with horses that have reached their ratings peaks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is nothing wrong with winning a trainer succeeding with stable transfers, after all it was a high profile stable move to Size that sparked arguably the greatest training career in Hong Kong racing history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Electronic Unicorn's early season shift from Ricky Yiu Poon-fai to Size - capped by a dominant first-up victory with top weight in the Panasonic Cup - elevated the Australian to mythological status, he was now the man with the </span><span class="s3">Midas</span><span class="s1"> touch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Size was soon the undisputed God of Hong Kong racing; he won not only that championship, but three in a row and nine from 16 in total (ten if you count a tie with Caspar Fownes in 2013-14, which the club should add retrospectively).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Lor is the local Messiah we want him to be he is going to need to do more than turn transfers around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Private Purchase Griffins, horses that arrive in Hong Kong with no prior racing experience, have been Size's specialty and Lor gets a chance to break through with his first PPG wins this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We shouldn't rush to peg this season's rookie of the year as the next Size, or another Richard Gibson - it's still early days - but if talented PPG's Super Missile and Have Fun Together can breakthrough on New Year's Day it will open up a new level of possibilities for Lor.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, China's biggest online health care platform, said on Thursday that losses narrowed by 2.6 per cent in the first half of the year, helped by strong growth in the number of users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its first earnings report since going public in May, the company, officially known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1">, reported a net loss of 444.2 million yuan (US$64 million) for the first six months, while revenue jumped 150 per cent to 1.1 billion yuan from the year-earlier period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mobile app Ping An Good Doctor had 228 million registered user by the end of June, up 19 per cent from the end of last year. Monthly active users, who tapped on the app for online medical and wellness consultation services, reached 48.6 million, climbing 51 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its aggressive expansion into new markets and offline businesses, Good Doctor has set up a US$120 million joint venture with ride-hailing platform Grab to enter Southeast Asia and fully acquired Wanjia HealthCare, a former unit of Ping An Group that runs a network of private clinics across China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will increase cooperation with internet companies and insurers to lift profit margin and control costs,” said Wang Tao, chairman and chief executive of Good Doctor.We will increase cooperation with internet companies and insurers to lift profit margin and control costsWang Tao, Ping An Good Doctor</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spun off from </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, China's biggest insurer by market value, Good Doctor was the first technology unicorn, a start-up valued at over US$1 billion, listed in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It raised US$1.1 billion from the most sought-after initial public offering in Hong Kong since 2009, with the retail tranche of the offer oversubscribed by 654 times.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flotation came amid high anticipation for technology IPOs following the stock exchange's listing rules reform in April to capitalise on China's technology boom over the past decade.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor priced its offering at the top end of the HK$50.80 to HK$54.80 range, but the stock has fallen 22 per cent below the IPO price. It closed 2.3 per cent down at HK$42.50 on Thursday, before the earnings were announced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company suffered a net loss of 1 billion yuan in 2017, its third straight year of annual losses.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest supplier of business management software, and Alibaba Cloud (AliCloud), a subsidiary of e-commerce powerhouse </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, plans to jointly launch a new range of online solutions designed to ramp up cloud computing adoption by enterprises across mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We see our key to success in China is increasing penetration of our cloud solutions into small and medium-sized enterprises,” Edward Chen, the chief business officer at SAP Greater China, said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The launch follows </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"> and AliCloud's strategic partnership, which was announced at an event in Shenzhen in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cloud computing enables companies to buy, sell, lease or distribute online a range of software and other digital resources as an on-demand service, just like electricity from a power grid. These resources are managed inside data centres. “Cloud” refers to the internet as depicted in computer network diagrams.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simon Hu Xiaoming, the president of AliCloud, said in April the strategic alliance with </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">German software giant </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1"> has about 11,000 corporate customers, many of them large enterprises, across the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. A growing number of those clients are cloud users, it said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">SAP</span><span class="s1">, AliCloud will jointly market and help deploy its Hana One and other “software-as-a-service” solutions on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou-based AliCloud, which was founded in 2009, is the mainland's largest cloud infrastructure services provider, with more than 2.3 million domestic clients as of March 31. These users include companies in the finance, transportation, genomics, medical and meteorological sectors, according to Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Morgan Stanley equity analyst Robert Lin said in a report that AliCloud had 500,000 paying clients, including half of the top 35 Chinese “unicorn” internet companies - start-up firms with a US$1 billion valuation as determined by public or private investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin said AliCloud started making its broad product offerings commercially available in 2014, “implying ample revenue growth opportunity”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's public cloud service market appears primed for rapid growth, with research firm Forrester predicting that it will reach US$3.8 billion by 2020, up from an estimated US$1.8 billion last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of China's biggest buyers of global assets, Fosun has kept its buying spree going this year even though a national crackdown on “irrational” overseas acquisitions has left most of its peers busy offloading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe our investments in the US will still be welcome, and we have seen more investment opportunities in Europe,” billionaire tycoon Guo Guangchang, who co-founded the company, told a press conference.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">India and countries in Africa were also welcoming Fosun's technology and investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo said he “trusted the wisdom of the Chinese and US leadership” to resolve their trade conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai-based Fosun owns the French holiday resort chain </span><span class="s3">Club Med</span><span class="s1">, and 25 per cent of the world's largest theatrical producer, Cirque du Soleil.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has acquired a number of overseas assets this year, including stakes in European fashion brands Lanvin and Wolford, despite coming under intense scrutiny from the government as it cracked down on debt-fuelled foreign shopping sprees by Chinese conglomerates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firms including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> found themselves under the regulatory spotlight and have been busy offloading overseas assets to comply with Beijing's guidelines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Fosun plans to spin off more business segments and list them in Hong Kong. It recently received approval from the bourse operator to float its Fosun Tourism and Culture Group unit, and has filed for an initial public offering for online parenting firm, Babytree Group, in which it owns a 25 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope we will present more unicorn-style, high-growth businesses to the capital market in Hong Kong and elsewhere,” said Chen Qiyu, executive director and co-president of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's market had become more attractive since the stock exchange reformed its listing rules to accommodate technology and biopharma firms, Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo and Chen were speaking after Fosun posted a 17 per cent rise in first-half profit on the back of strong growth in its health care, tourism and fashion segments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net profit rose to 6.9 billion yuan (US$1 billion) for the first six months of this year from 5.9 billion yuan in the same period of 2017, while revenue was up 20 per cent to 43.5 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the firm had fallen 1.5 per cent to HK$14.32 as of 1:10pm on Wednesday after the results announcement.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multiple classes of shares among their shareholders may be allowed to raise capital in Hong Kong by the middle of 2018, as the city's Securities&amp;Futures Commission (SFC) backs away from its position on the "One Share, One Vote" principle, which has been a pillar of the local capital market since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A pilot scheme will be launched next year, whereby certain start-up companies that have attained the so-called unicorn status - valuations exceeding US$1 billion - will be allowed to raise capital on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange through initial public offerings, if they put in place sufficient investor protection provisions, two sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The protection provisions may include a sunset clause that compels the companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stocks listed under this pilot programme will also need to be designated with a special code to distinguish them from other listed companies, for reminding investors to be aware of potential risks, the source said. The pilot plan could be widened if sufficient number of high-quality companies are attracted to Hong Kong without regulatory problems, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's about-turn is a major step forward in helping Hong Kong compete with global capital markets including New York, Singapore and Shanghai, especially in attracting technology and new economy companies to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for companies to raise funds this year, falling behind New York and Shanghai. Between January and June, the city's stock market raised US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, a drop of 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised in the same period in 2016, when it was ranked as the leader for new listings worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> pushed for a consultation to launch dual-class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections by the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the SFC in 2014 opposed exemption for </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, to list in Hong Kong. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source said the SFC was supporting Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who in August signalled the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC and the government also want to see dual-class shares listed on the main board instead of a proposed separate board, as they do not want to see a fragmented market structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange is likely to announce the pilot scheme in the coming weeks, the second source said. It will hold a second round of detailed rule changes for this pilot scheme before dual-class shares can be listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Can Shenzhen, the former boomtown in southern China's Guangdong province known for its pioneering economic reforms, remain the “world's factory” for global technology start-up firms?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The head of a start-up accelerator in Taiwan that is backed by the nation's government believes her team can change the playing field by leveraging the island's unique advantages in terms of design and quality of hardware.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anita Huang, a former regional executive for US technology giants </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, was appointed the head of Taiwan Startup Stadium (TSS) earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accelerator is funded by the National Development Council (NDC), a government branch of the Executive Yuan, or Taiwan's cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang has two key missions: putting Taiwan's start-ups on the world map, and finding a way to attract start-ups from other countries to do business with the island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The TSS was only launched a few months but it has already generated plenty of buzz among the international start-up community, for example by aggressively promoting local start-ups at a high-profile event in the US last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new body has also attracted the attention of foreign companies by promoting Taiwan as a destination for hardware sourcing and manufacturing, after growing concerns about product quality in Shenzhen, which lies just across the border from Hong Kong but in some ways is a world apart.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you want to compare price [with Shenzhen], we can't beat China,” Huang said on the sidelines of a </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">-sponsored event in Taipei focusing on start-ups and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yes, you can find cheaper stuff in Shenzhen, where prototypes can typically be manufactured at a very fast speed,” she said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But if you think twice and consider the excellence in product design and manufacturing quality, many clients actually come back to Taiwan for business after trying Shenzhen.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen has served as the home base for a number of Chinese technology giants including internet portal and real-time messaging service leader Tencent, as well as the two biggest manufacturers of telecoms equipment on the mainland, namely Huawei and ZTE.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">DJI, which controls about 70 per cent of global market for civilian drones, is also headquartered in this industrial but sun-stroked city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology start-ups from Europe and the US have chosen Shenzhen as the production base for their early prototypes because of its extensive supply chains, clusters of manufacturing vendors, cheap labour costs and proximity to the giant Chinese market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They often head here first because it is a cheap and effective way to get demonstration products made before they head out to court venture capital investors and pitch for funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But while this special economic zone endorsed by late leader Deng Xiaoping has maintained its reputation as a world factory for three decades, inflation and labour costs have shot up in recent years to erode its competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also facing challenges related to intellectual property rights as some of the Chinese tech companies that originated there have been dubbed clones of advanced products originating in the West.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In some cases, high-quality counterfeits of iconic tech products can be purchased in Shenzhen even before they are officially released on the Chinese mainland or in other markets. A case in point would be the recently released iPhone 6S.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just this week, local media in Shenzhen reported that several factories in the Pearl River Delta, including a mobile phone plant belonging to Jingchi Plastics in the Fenggang township of Dongguan, were shut down immediately after China took a week off to celebrate its national day.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This further stoked concerns that electronics manufacturers in the region, in which Shenzhen always plays a leading role, have been losing out to their foreign rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spate of shutdowns followed a drop in demand for exports of electronic information products like trendy wearables and other gadgets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, rising costs at factories in Guangdong are prompting companies from Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere to withdraw from the province and relocate to cheaper neighbouring countries like Vietnam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Huang, this translates as a golden opportunity for Taiwan to grab more international clients as the island is well-known for its talent pool of programmers and engineers, as well as its hardware production capacities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang related the story of how one non-Chinese maker of electronic devices travelled to Shenzhen first to get some prototypes made but was disillusioned after the local vendor failed to deliver the required quality. In frustration, the client quit the city and headed to Taiwan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang said Shenzhen can still lean on its formidable reputation, but no one knows for exactly how long.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Shenzhen still has a lot of advantages, especially in terms of manufacturing scale, and it already has a good reputation, as many people already know what Shenzhen can do when it comes to technology manufacturing,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said manufacturing speed was one area where Taiwan is racing to catch up, but that it must do so without sacrificing either quality or its competitive prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TSS has worked with more than 100 homegrown start-ups and partnered with dozens global tech leaders including </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, which chose Taiwan as the location for its regional data centre, to help them expand beyond the island into Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Huang led a group of 30 people, including representatives from a dozen Taiwan start-ups, to join the highly influential TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her team also used the event to pitch the idea of doing business in Taiwan to a number of European and US start-ups, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eventually we hope there will be some unicorn companies born in Taiwan, so we can put more Taiwanese start-ups on the world map,” she said, referring to a popular investment industry term for a start-up whose valuation has risen above US$1 billion even before it goes public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recent examples of unicorns include Xiaomi, often known as the “Apple of China”, and Uber, the San Francisco-based car-hailing app that has transformed the way people move around big cities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Hong Kong Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung has joined WeLab Virtual Bank, which has applied for a licence in the city, as chairman, he said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan joined WeLab, the virtual bank's parent company, as a senior adviser in July, his first appointment since leaving the government in July 2017. WeLab, an online lender, serves more than 30 million customers in Hong Kong and mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial technology company, a home-grown Hong Kong unicorn, is also among the first batch of 29 applicants for virtual banking licences, which will be issued by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, the city's de facto central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a home-grown fintech company, which has a sound risk-management system. It has invested in technology and security measures to provide innovative banking services to customers. As I am confident about the future of the company, I have agreed to take up the chairman's role,” Chan told the media on Tuesday. He will, however, “only act as non-executive chairman”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is a very positive move for the HKMA to introduce virtual banking this year, as well as its Faster Payment System this week. These are very important measures for Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab co-founder Simon Loong was present for the announcement. A former banker with </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">, Loong help set up WeLab five years ago with a money lender's licence in Hong Kong, and has since teamed up with mainland Chinese partners to allow customers to apply for loans through the internet or smartphones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are targeting younger customers who are between 20 and 35 years old, who are not the traditional banks' target clients. Many traditional banks focus on clients who are over 40 or 50 years old, as they borrow larger sums of money. We believe by adopting technology, we can offer small loans but can still make a profit. We want to target tech-savvy customers,” said Loong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 70 per cent of the fintech company's customers are between 20 to 40 years old, while customers in this age group account for only 30 per cent of the clientele at traditional banks, Loong added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to the use of technology such as chatbots and facial recognition, WeLab only needs 700 employees in Hong Kong and mainland China to served its 30 million customers. “Our customers have increased by eight times over the past two years, but our staff has only increased by 1.8 times,” said Loong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, the company applied to list on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange. There was some speculation in the market that it would raise US$500 million, but Loong declined to comment on the matter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Chinese tech start-up listed in Hong Kong released a profit warning on Monday, joining a wave of once-promising mainland internet and tech start-ups that have faced difficulties in their operations recently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Feiyu Technology International Company</span><span class="s1">, a Chinese mobile and web games developer, informed its shareholders and potential investors on its website that it may record a net loss of approximately 75 million to 85 million yuan for the six months ended June 30, 2016 under the International Financial Reporting Standards as compared to a net profit of 92 million yuan for the corresponding period in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following the announcement, Feiyu's share price dropped from HK$1.63 in early trading on Monday to HK$1.4 on Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Feiyu went public in Hong Kong in December 2014, one year after it was set up in Xiamen in Fujian province, on the back of its success in developing several popular mobile games, including Carrot Fantasy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its statement, Feiyu explained that the expected net loss was due to the delay in launching key new games and a decrease in revenue of the group's existing games as they reached mature stages of their product life cycles, as well as a significant increase in administrative expenses and research and development costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Feiyu saw annual revenue of 322 million yuan with net profit of 200 million yuan, according to mainland media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company expected to launch six new games this year but so far has only launched one game on the Tencent platform, released on June 13.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, ShenqiBuy.com, another high-profile e-commerce company founded by 17-year-old Wang Kaixin, China's youngest internet tycoon, reportedly laid off half of its employees and moved the office, mainland media reports have said since Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ShenqiBuy, or MagicBuy in English, targeted the post-1995 generation of young Chinese and has attracted huge attention across the country since it was set up last year by a 17-year-old high school dropout.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In January this year, Wang successfully landed 20 million yuan in A round fundraising from several domestic investors only three months after the launch of her app, and after appearing on the Beijing TV programme I am Unicorn, which helps start-ups lure venture capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the Chinese public has begun to have doubts about Shenqibuy since May when international monthly magazine GQ revealed that the company was faking the number of users and average daily orders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of February, more than 800 mainland Chinese online to offline (O2O) companies that landed A Series financing in 2014 had burned through their investments and had been shuttered, according to the government-run Guangzhou Daily.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's technology sector is in a bubble - but not the kind that erases huge fortunes when it bursts. This bubble, imposed by the Chinese authorities in Beijing in the form of the censored, closed internet also known as the Great Firewall, has stymied efforts by the world's second-largest economy to create truly innovative breakthroughs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Various commentators of late have written about how China has "won" against Silicon Valley or has caught up with it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They cite the rapid growth of BAT - </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1">, Alibaba Group Holdings and Tencent Inc - and their innovations in e-commerce, mobile payments, social network and instant messaging as evidence of China's innovation prowess[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2080409/how-innovative-china-beating-facebook-google-and-amazon]. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What they often don't mention is that BAT were born, survived and thrived in a protected market, which is the other aspect of the bubble. It keeps competitors out, as well restricting the free flow of information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shielded from competition from the American tech innovators they original copied, and with a home market of 1.35 billion people, BAT and newer Chinese web startups have been able to grow rapidly on[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2095721/why-chinese-web-users-will-pay-content-westerners-wont-and-apps-content] the mainland and come up with innovations that have evolved out of the closed Chinese internet environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recent examples include live streaming companies, and so-called knowledge payment services that offer online comedy, investing tips, beauty advice for a fee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have attracted venture capital funding on the basis of their millions of paying subscribers. But very few of these business models are exportable outside of China. All this content is available for free on </span><span class="s3">YouTube</span><span class="s1">, which is banned in China. If that ban was ever lifted, these start-ups would find their business models severely disrupted overnight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for BAT, they have largely been unable to make inroads outside China, other than being listed on stock markets in the US or in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ancient Chinese scientists gave the world paper currency, the compass, gunpowder and moveable type printing. What inventions of similar importance have emerged from China since the country embarked on its economic transformation three decades ago? Nothing comes to mind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compare the inventions of antiquity with the major tech milestones of the past 50 years: mobile phones in the 70s, personal computers in the 80s, the internet and web search in the 90s, and smartphones and social media after 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is doubtful any of these US tech breakthroughs would have happened without free market competition, and an open information environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world is overdue for another game changing technology, one that should come from China given its near unlimited manpower and financial muscle. But with the free flow of ideas hampered by strict censorship laws designed to maintain social harmony and keep the ruling Communist Party in power, the odds are stacked against it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under Xi Jinping's rule, China's internet controls have tightened and scientists and academics complain they can't access overseas research, hampering their work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the parliamentary meetings in March, some delegates proposed an easing of the restrictions[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2078350/chinas-internet-censorship-under-fire-two-sessions] - but ironically one proposal was censored and the other went unreported on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What about the next generation of Chinese tech firms: could a game changing innovation emerge from this group, which includes scores of of so-called unicorns, or private firms valued at over US$1 billion?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China accounts for a fifth of the world's unicorns, while the US has 55 per cent, according to CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's biggest unicorn is </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies Inc</span><span class="s1">, with a valuation of US$68 billion, followed by China's Xiaomi at US$46 billion, and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> - the dominant Chinese ride-sharing company that bought out Uber's China business - at US$34 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi started in 2010 as an iPhone copycat while Didi drove the company it copied out of China after it got a US$1 billion investment from Apple.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Xiaomi's phones have become commodities and Didi is, as one tech commentator put it, an "illegal cab company with a slick smartphone app."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To their credit, Didi and Xiaomi recognise the limitations of their current copycat business models and are investing in research and development, with Didi targeting artificial intelligence, which is also a focus of BAT.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The newest crop of Chinese unicorns includes Ofo[http://www.scmp.com/tech/leaders-founders/article/2088427/chinese-bike-sharing-start-says-its-now-worth-more-us2-billion], one of many so-called "Uber-for-bicycle" companies that are attracting venture capital investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While they satisfy a need for convenience and environmentally friendly "last mile" transportation, it's hard to see these companies as the vanguard of the next game-changing technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Billion dollar valuations for companies with little in the way of intellectual capital is reminiscent of Silicon Valley's dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when flimsy start-ups like online grocer Webvan saw their valuations soar to billions of dollars after their initial stock offers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Silicon Valley dot-com bubble burst in spectacular fashion soon after - but out of the rubble came many of the tech advances that have changed people's lives over the past 15 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maybe China is in a tech bubble after all - the type that overvalues companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But before the country can come up with the next truly game changing technology, both bubbles will need to burst.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size has dipped his toe back in the Group One pond over the past year after a drought, but even his stunning upset with It Has To Be You has failed to ignite any serious optimism about Fay Fay's prospects in the HK$8 million Citibank Hong Kong Gold Cup on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At 125-1, It Has To Be you threw out his credentials to follow Fay Fay's 2012 win and be Size's second Hong Kong Derby winner. Added to Glorious Days' Stewards' Cup victory in January, he gave the trainer a third Group One in the last 12 months following a three-year absence from that elite circle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size said yesterday it wasn't something he lay awake at night worrying about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Of course, it's nice to win them but first you need the horse. I'll cop it sweet when those horses come along but I'd go crazy worrying about how many Group Ones I'm winning here," he said. "It isn't like Australia, where there are many, many Group Ones in half a dozen different states and if you look hard enough you can travel to find a race you can win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In Hong Kong, you always have one or two horses who dominate each distance range and you can't escape. Every time you turn up for a Group One, they are there, and you can't beat them." In Hong Kong, you always have one or two horses who dominate each distance range and you can't escape. Every time you turn up for a Group One, they are there, and you can't beat them</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's something Size went through with Electronic Unicorn when he was the dominant miler and on the flipside with Sight Winner, who won a surprise 2009 Champions Mile then spent 21/2 years marooned on a high mark and finishing within three lengths of Good Ba Ba, Able One and Beauty Flash, but unable to win. And now Size is a realist where Fay Fay is concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I thought he was, at best, an average Derby winner last year, winning off a 110 rating and nothing special and I thought he'd struggle after," Size said. "So far, I've been pleasantly surprised. Even though he hasn't won, he has run truly and to his rating. Going to the Gold Cup, I think he can earn prize money, but it would be a quantum leap in his form to beat California Memory."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Umberto Rispoli, Size has a jockey who has been positive about Fay Fay's place in the pecking order especially getting up to 2,000m. Rispoli has been aboard Fay Fay finishing well in shorter races and said he believed the gelding had only California Memory to fear at the distance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Umberto got the ride when Douglas Whyte rode Real Specialist one day in the same race and then the same situation with Glorious Days. It wasn't Douglas' decision not to ride the horse, I'm happy to keep Umberto on," Size said. "He gets on well with Fay Fay, he understands him and he's done nothing wrong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, stewards yesterday completed their inquiry into Alvin Ng Ka-chun's handling of Mr Speedy on February 12.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They took no action but cautioned Ng he had ridden an ill-judged race.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> . said it'll go on a hiring spree over the next three years, as it reorganises its China investment banking team into additional categories to serve so-called new economy companies that are expected to raise up to US$200 billion in capital over the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new economy in China is newer than, and very different from, many economies in the West,” said the bank's co-head of Asia-Pacific investment banking Murli Maiya, aiming to turn the team into a “tech-everything” organisation. “In three to four years, our bankers would be obsolete, as our clients change in a way they can't understand, so we have to force the change here. ”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hiring also forms part of its plan to build a securities business onshore in China, once it is approved by local regulators. In May, the bank applied for approval to set up a majority-owned securities company in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reorganisation of its China team, which began earlier this month, will expand its workforce by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent, while dividing the current structure into seven new sectors, comprising financial services and technology, health care and technology, enterprise and technology services, new mobility, lifestyle and smart manufacturing, digital access, and infrastructure and commodities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the heart of China's techno-nationalism is a hit list of 200 unicorns [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139684/heart-chinas-techno-nationalism-hit-list-200-unicorns]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reorganisation coincides with the overhaul that Hong Kong's stock market operator and securities regulator pushed through last year, changing the city's listing regulations to allow biotechnology research teams and technology start-ups to raise capital in the city. In a survey conducted by PwC, most Chinese unicorns said they prefer to raise funds in Hong Kong, more so than in New York and Shanghai or Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also aligns with a liberalisation in China's ownership rules, which allows banks like </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> to own up to 51 per cent share in their onshore operations, a structure which may eventually lead to wholly foreign-owned operations [http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2145181/bring-trade-tension-down-notch-and-talk-says-jpmorgan-chief] in Asia's largest capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland, home to more than 160 unicorns, or start-ups with at least US$1 billion in valuation, is the main reason the bank is retooling its China team. The bank expects these unicorns to need to raise about US$200 billion through initial public offerings and private market placements in the next three years, said the bank's China investment banking head Houston Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The old industry structure has become increasingly inefficient to cope with our business needs in China's changing economic dynamics,” Huang said, adding that he wants the team to have a “tech DNA.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is a leading player in the world unicorn race and the speed of growth is unprecedented, so we have to find a way to better serve the growing number of clients representing China's new economy,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that they will hire more graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, which are considered the key to China's economic future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maiya said the new approach in China could potentially disrupt the 200-year tradition of Wall Street investment banking practise and set a test case for the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Everywhere in the world, people are looking at what we do in China, because they want to see what's happening. It could be a template of what we do in banking,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Xin, one of the pioneers of China's online video-streaming market, looks to be in search of a second act as he shared his views on artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and other topics in technology following his release from prison on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The controversial Chinese internet entrepreneur was handed a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence and fined 1 million yuan (US$159 million) in 2016 by the Beijing Haidian District People's Court, which found him guilty of “distributing obscene materials for personal gain” as his online business provided easy access to pornography and various pirated content.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separate posts by family and friends on </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> suggested that a comeback could be in store for the 38-year-old Wang, who discussed his views on the latest trends in China's red-hot technology market at a dinner after his release.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I firmly believe that in the near future there will be another legendary story of master Wang,” said He Xiaopeng, the co-founder and chairman of electric car start-up Xiaopeng Motors, in a </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> post on Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He described Wang as being “in good health and synchronised mind like us” as the newly freed entrepreneur discussed various hi-tech developments, such as AI, video streaming and blockchain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, He posted group photos with Wang alongside David Li Xueling, the co-founder and chairman of video-based social network YY, and Michael Yao Jinbo, the chairman and chief executive of Chinese online classifieds platform operator </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He subsequently deleted that post and photos from his </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> account. Neither Wang nor YY's Li could be reached for comment on Thursday. Xiaopeng's He did not reply to an inquiry made via </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, while calls made to </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">'s Yao were not answered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Wang's business reputation will need rehabilitation after his conviction and stint in prison, he will find a market that is fostering the development of a growing number of technology start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's hi-tech boom has minted a new generation of billionaires who are involved in fields like online shopping, mobile gaming or AI rather than property development or traditional financial services.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has also encouraged increased entrepreneurship to ensure enough jobs for the world's most populous nation, while steering the economy away from the old, foreign investment-led manufacturing model to one that is grounded in innovative, internet-related technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a trend that supports advanced automation through such hi-tech developments as the internet of things, big data analytics, cloud computing and AI.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang, a graduate of the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, founded Shenzhen-based online video service Qvod Technology Co in 2007 after working at </span><span class="s3">Shanda Interactive Entertainment</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qvod gained notoriety for peer-to-peer video-streaming platform called Kuaibo, which allowed users to watch mostly pirated video and pornography, as well as a popular desktop video-editing software.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By 2011, Qvod had a reported 80 per cent share of the video-streaming market in China and about 500 million users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November 2013, a coalition of the country's biggest online video providers - including </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Youku Tudou</span><span class="s1"> and Sohu - sued Qvod for unauthorised video sharing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When police started investigating Wang later that year for repeated violations of copyright law and for spreading pornography online, he fled overseas and was on the run for about 110 days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was apprehended by </span><span class="s3">Interpol</span><span class="s1"> in August 2014 at an unspecified country and repatriated back to the mainland, according to a </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> report at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After Wang was charged in 2015, the police reported that most of the videos found in Qvod's servers were pornographic content.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three other Qvod executives were each handed prison sentences of up to three years and three months, and fined 500,000 yuan each by the Beijing court in 2016. Qvod was fined 10 million yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A report by Global Times, a government-backed newspaper, said Wang showed remorse for his actions during the trial. It quoted him as saying that “faced with the choice between social responsibility and company interests, I chose the latter”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qvod's official website remains live. A post dated January 2017 on its homepage said the company has not released any new video-streaming players.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore consumers eagerly awaiting a price war to erupt between ride-hailing giant Grab and Indonesian rival Go-Jek, which is poised to enter the city next month, should not hold their breath.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab plans to take a cautious approach and push to further improve its services, rather than drive up subsidies, as competition with Go-Jek intensifies in its home market and across Southeast Asia, company president Ming Maa said in an interview at the China Conference organised by the South China Morning Post in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not believe that winning customer heartshare and mindshare is driven by subsidies,” he said. "It's driven by providing them good service and a good product.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 41-year-old Maa, who joined Grab two years ago from Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Group Corp</span><span class="s1">, said the Singapore-based company spends significantly less on subsidies "by a very, very wide margin”, citing its track record against </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> before their merger in March this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Singapore, a preview of the clash to come between Grab and Go-Jek [https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2149640/singapore-preview-how-grab-and-go-jek-will-likely-face-across-southeast-asia]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa's comments come after Grab and Uber were slapped a combined S$13 million (US$9.4 million) fine last month by Singapore's antitrust watchdog for anti-competitive behaviour as a result of their merger, which had effectively made Grab the city state's dominant ride-hailing player with about 80 per cent market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore found that Grab's exclusivity deals with taxi companies, car rental partners and even some drivers had hampered other ride-hailing players from expanding in the city state, while prices for Grab services increased. So apart from the financial penalty, the commission instructed Grab to dismantle its exclusive partner arrangements as well as restore its pre-merger pricing algorithms and commission rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expansion of Go-Jek in Singapore would make the city state its second international market after launching in Vietnam last month. Go-Jek has been in talks with Comfort-Delgro, Singapore's largest taxi operator that previously had an exclusive deal with Uber, according to a report by news site TechCrunch earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa dismissed concerns that Go-Jek's imminent arrival in Singapore would adversely affect Grab's business in its home market, saying that Grab "loves competition”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab, founded by Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling, is currently Southeast Asia's most valuable tech start-up, with </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, Uber and SoftBank among its major shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Competition is good for the industry, it makes us stronger and helps us develop better products and services,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We've been blessed to be able to compete with the best of the best - Uber. That experience taught us a lot.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab may need to fall back on that experience as it is locked in a heated battle for market share across Southeast Asia with Go-Jek.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jakarta-based Go-Jek, founded by Nadiem Makarim, started as a motorcycle ride-hailing service in 2010 in Indonesia, but it now offers everything from meal deliveries to over-the-counter medicine and massage services on-demand through its super app. The company earlier this year announced plans to expand into Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines to challenge Grab's dominance in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Go-Jek and Grab are also building up their war chests to help drive their respective expansion programmes in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek steps up rivalry with Grab as it expands in Southeast Asia [https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2152604/indonesias-go-jek-sees-lot-experimentation-it-expands-fight-grab]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek aims to raise about US$2 billion from a new funding round with its existing investors, according to a Reuters report last month that cited unnamed sources. Those backers include </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Warburg Pincus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa said Grab is on track to raise US$3 billion from investors that include SoftBank, </span><span class="s3">Toyota Motor Corp</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Microsoft</span><span class="s1"> by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When you look at our competition, many of them take short cuts because they're chasing after metrics to show how fast they're growing … One such short cut is fraud,” Maa said. "These types of short cuts are tempting to do, but we do not do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Without elaborating, he said some of Grab's rivals have up to 50 per cent fraud on their platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Grab has come under fire for raising fares and reducing promotions, following its merger with Uber's Southeast Asian operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab was also hit by a backlash in July when it announced changes to its loyalty programme, devaluing points earned by users over the year with "immediate effect”. The backlash prompted Grab to postpone certain changes till the end of September, giving users more time to claim rewards at the previous rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a Forrester report released earlier this month, Grab was criticised for changes that appeared "heavy-handed and arrogant”, sparking unhappiness in both customers and drivers alike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Grab triggered an explosive emotional reaction that undermined its market position and spread like a virus,” the report said. It added that the company was not ready to venture into other businesses like payments and food delivery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maa acknowledged that Grab could "always do better” in improving its user experience, adding that the firm has a "laser focus” on providing sustainable, safe and reliable services to both its passengers and drivers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has already branched out from ride-hailing to payments, food delivery, logistics and on-demand grocery orders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Thursday, Grab announced a partnership with </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> that could help further engage its users. Grab will offer its 110 million users the option of using either a virtual or physical prepaid </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1"> issued via its app. The move will give millions of users who are underserved by banks, or are unbanked, with a means to buy products and services online, not just within Grab's ecosystem but at any merchant that accepts </span><span class="s3">Mastercard</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initiative will be rolled out within the first quarter of the next year in Singapore and the Philippines, with plans to expand it to the rest of Grab's markets by the end of 2019, the company said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A brilliant Brett Prebble ride on the Tony Cruz-trained Mega Champion stole the Happy Valley Clubhouse 20th Anniversary Cup, the in-form Australian navigating a miraculous path from the widest gate into a perfect midfield position on the rails.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A solidly run race helped, as Prebble picked his way through inside runs and narrowly edged out the fast-closing Forgive And Forget late.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"All the credit goes to Brett for that win, to get from gate 12 to that spot was an unbelievable piece of riding," Cruz said after his charge went off at just better than 10-1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Once I saw where he had settled, I was very confident and the race panned out perfectly for him."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prebble has now ridden Mega Champion three times this season - his only rides for Cruz this term - for two wins and a second.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douglas Whyte reclaimed top spot in the Jockeys' Championship and John Size took the outright lead in the trainers' division as Classic Jewellery finally broke through for his second win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Classic Jewellery has been fighting an uphill battle, and developed a reputation as being a touch weak, since an impressive debut victory that gave him a 14-point increase in the handicaps at the start of last term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't think he is necessarily stronger than last season, but I think we've got to be careful when we run him, you've just got to take your time with him," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We've had to come to Happy Valley to get the win, and we might have to look to try back here again as the Sha Tin mile might be a bit strong for him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm glad he has had a good win, after he ran such a great debut and never really lived up to it."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weichong Marwing rode a double and snatched the Jockey Challenge with 24 points, winning early in the night with a positive ride on Capital K and then for David Ferraris on track specialist Imperial Rome in the last.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Weichong might not ride the most winners here, but at the end of the day, he rides the most for me," Ferraris said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This horse really loves it at this track, and when you've got a horse like that at Happy Valley, I think you need to keep him here as long as possible."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peter Ho Leung's Capital K has dropped from Class Two to Class Four in 13 starts here and, coming off a brave run when stuck wide, was pushed into prominent spot by Marwing and then ground down the leader, Benefactor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Danny Shum Chap-shing took over Good Looking Watch (Tye Angland) this season and a decent first-up effort for his new handler was followed by a solid trial, and a dominant Class Five victory last night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I thought he ran really well for us last start - we ran into Real Dragon, so you can see he has some quality, and we came here tonight feeling very confident," said Shum, who predicted more victories for the six-year-old.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He'll only get six or seven points for that and will stay in the grade. His weight has gone up 20 pounds, he is eating well, sleeping well and his trackwork is great."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andy Leung Ting-wah chimed in with a winner. Storm Unicorn breaking his local maiden status after 13 unsuccessful starts - a positive, and then patient, ride from Derek Leung Ka-chun getting the five-year-old into a one-off spot from barrier nine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He got in the right spot and then waited and waited, and he didn't go until just the right time," Leung said of his namesake's effort, which saw the rider suspended for two days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I always thought this horse would show his best when he got up to 1,650m."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peter Ng Bik-kuen, along with most other trainers, was away at the Ready to Run Sale in New Zealand, but he recorded a double, with Asmodai (Alvin Ng Ka-chun) and Home With Glory (Howard Cheng Yue-tin).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Rapid Finance</span><span class="s1"> (CRF), the mainland's largest online consumer lending platform, is looking to triple the number of users this year as it looks to create a business on par with a major commercial bank's credit-card division.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zane Wang Zhengyu, founder and chief executive of CRF, told the South China Morning Post that the company would be impervious to the challenges facing other peer-to-peer (P2P) operators on the mainland, and would continue to bolster its micro-credit businesses in accordance with Beijing's financial reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have been trying to nurture the growth of online micro-credit business in China," he said. "High frequency of small-loan borrowings is the key to our success."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CRF, founded in 2010, has 1.2 million borrowers on its platform at present. Wang , however, has set his sights high and wants the firm to have about 3 million borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sino Guarantee, Bank of Shanghai inject fresh capital into online lender China Rapid Finance[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2046226/sino-guarantee-bank-shanghai-inject-fresh-capital-online-lender]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CRF would also continue to augment its capital resources and recently bolstered its finances with a US$70 million funding from a clutch of investors including China United SME Guarantee Corp, known as Sino Guarantee, and Broadline Capital, he added.We have been trying to nurture the growth of online micro-credit business in ChinaZane Wang Zhengyu, founder and chief executive, </span><span class="s3">China Rapid Finance</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the mainland, a commercial bank's credit-card unit normally has 8 million to 10 million cardholders more than half of whom would repay the loans before the credit holiday expires, crimping interest income for credit card issuers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We expect our platform to grow to 10 million borrowers in two to three years so that we can become a giant online micro-credit firm," Wang said. "Our business model will be an ideal example of how China's financial reforms can benefit the masses."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Rapid Finance casts eye towards untapped consumer base via partnerships with tech giants[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1934750/china-rapid-finance-casts-eye-towards-untapped-consumer-base]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 70 million start-ups and 270 million blue-collar workers are not adequately served by the country's banking system, and often find their requests for business loans and credit cards rejected, according to Ping An Puhui, the micro-credit unit of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese policymakers are looking to revamp the country's financial system by promoting wider and better use of internet technologies to offer small loans to needy people and firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A series of scandals involving fraud and collapses of P2P platforms, however, prompted the regulators to step up policing of the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">P2P companies will have to appoint a commercial bank as a custodian to clear a regulatory review procedure in the coming months, a move that is likely to force hundreds of players into liquidation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a typical case, a P2P operator collects a large sum of funds from the lenders before granting multi-million-yuan loans to developers or manufactures at a lofty interest rates, hugely distorting the definition of peer-to-peer lending.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inside the operations of China's top credit risk start-up: Zane Wang talks about the growth of China Rapid Finance[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/1897721/inside-operations-chinas-top-credit-risk-start-zane-wang]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the CRF platform, a matchmaker for borrower and lenders, loans valued at between several hundred yuan and 100,000 yuan (HK$112,021) are extended to borrowers to support their purchase of consumer goods. CRF charges a service fee ranging from 5 to 10 yuan per transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, more than 6 million loans were facilitated on the CRF platform. Wang expects transactions to cross 30 million this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Loans can't be just a one-off deal," he said. "As borrowers' demand for credit continues to rise, a healthy business with sufficient risk-management is needed to serve the 500 million mainland residents."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CRF currently sports a tag of "unicorn" - unlisted technology firms valued at more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The founder wouldn't disclose details of its further financing plans including the potential listing venue and the targeted fund size in the next round of fund-raising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang, 60, who worked as a senior financial analyst and senior manager at big consumer-credit companies in the US, returned to the mainland in 2001 to help the domestic credit-assessment sector.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Champion trainer John Size says his four runners are all in great shape for Sunday's important Group Two Premier Bowl at Sha Tin but he isn't take anything for granted despite his numerical advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size saddles up Hong Kong's two top-rated horses, Thewizardofoz and Mr Stunning, in the 1,200m feature, ably assisted by Amazing Kids and D B Pin and the Australian handler has quietly assumed the role of the leading trainer of sprintersover the past 18 months, at least in numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yield has not quite lived up to that yet, with three Group Threes and a Group Two last season, but the Premier Bowl has had significance as a Group One pointer in the past and a guide to the December internationals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Premier Bowl was the race from which Absolute Champion emerged as a star, taking the Hong Kong Sprint next start; Aerovelocity also won the double and Lucky Bubbles was unlucky not to 12 months ago. Even Size's 64-1 winner in 2011, Rich Unicorn, surprised again with a close fourth on international day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm really happy with how all four are going. They are at different stages of their preparations, some have had a race and Thewizardofoz hasn't, but I can't fault them," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rival trainers need to get what they can before John Size kicks into gear[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2114451/rival-trainers-need-get-what-they-can-john-size-kicks-gear]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Mr Stunning looks like he has come on for his first run back, D B Pin has been his usual self and I think Amazing Kids has improved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He wasn't as fit as the others first-up but didn't finish far from them. He didn't catch the eye in the trial since but that's him. He just does what he wants to do and never gives you much of a guide on the dirt, but he is different on race day."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then there's Thewizardofoz, who finished last season with a sensational Group Three win, has had three barrier trials and was actually asked to do something by Joao Moreira last Friday with a sharp mid-trial move before running second to Mr Stunning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joao Moreira sides with John Size for Group Twos as Thewizardofoz and Western Express trial well[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2115226/joao-moreira-sides-john-size-group-twos-thewizardofoz-and-western]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Thewizard is quite a gross horse, he's not skinny. So, even with a few trials, he will be improving with racing," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He did a bit in the trial because I think Joao wanted to get around some slower ones in front of him that weren't taking him anywhere. For his target, I'm leaning towards the Hong Kong Sprint but let's have a look at him in his races and see."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size's armoury of stars will almost all be on show on Sunday, with rising unbeaten talent Nothingilikemore returning after an impressive three-year-old campaign, and the only absentee is dual Group One winner Contentment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fixture in the top mile races for the past two seasons, Contentment resumed poorly with a ninth in the Celebration Cup and Size has backed off him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He seemed a bit tired and listless, which might be a hangover from the trip to the Yasuda Kinen in Japan so I've given him some time off," Size said. "He will be back working again in 10 days and we'll see how he progresses from there."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for nominal Classic Mile favourite Nothingilikemore, Size has no path to that race mapped out: "We have to see what happens in his first-up run because, if he wins, he will be in a different class and, if he doesn't, he'll still be in Class Two, so there's no point programming his next one until we know what he's eligible for.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But he has had a long enough break - it's six months since he ran and that's probably even a bit too long, so I wanted to get him going. I'll be guided by him but he'll probably want a couple of runs before the Classic Mile early next year and, at some point, we'll see if he can run a mile. We don't really know that much about what he can do yet after just four starts."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is likely to be a rash of new technology sector initial public offerings (IPOs) over the next 12 to 18 months, especially by companies already backed by China's technology giants Alibaba and Tencent, following the strong equity market performance this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Research firm CB Insights says that out of the 46 “unicorns” in China, 21 are backed by China's Big Four internet giants, Alibaba, Baidu, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, and Tencent or their affiliates, such as </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A unicorn is a start-up firm valued at more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And it adds that China's tech leaders are still pouring money into venture-capital-backed firms right across Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, for instance, made over 30 investments in venture-capital-backed tech firms in the region between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there are few signs yet that Alibaba or Tencent are in any rush to cash in their investments, buoyant market conditions are driving mainland firms, including those operating in the technology sector, back to the markets for more capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E Zhihuan, chief economist at Bank of China Hong Kong (</span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">) said the signs are good that tech IPOs will pick up strongly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock market sentiment is relatively upbeat, supported by a low interest rate environment and recent inclusion of A shares in MSCI's key emerging markets index,” E said, adding that the slowing of regulatory approval for IPOs in mainland China is also a driver.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market benchmark, the Hang Seng Index, is up 18 per cent in the year so far while the MSCI International World Index has gained 10 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Likely to come to market in coming months are a number of tech IPOs, which are already backed by Alibaba or Tencent:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">●Best, a Chinese logistics company backed by Alibaba, said this week it aims to join the fray against the mainland's five largest express delivery firms by raising up to US$750 million from an IPO in New York, betting an e-commerce boom in China will spur demand for its package delivery services and supply chain technology;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, the first online-only insurer in China, could also be set to list its shares in Hong Kong this year, raising up to US$2 billion. Its major shareholders include Alibaba's financial-services affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which has a 16 per cent stake, as well as Tencent, and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● China Reading, the country's largest online publishing and e-book company, plans to raise up to US$800 million in an IPO, possibly in Hong Kong. The Tencent-backed firm has about 600 million registered readers across its nine reading platforms and about 70 per cent of the company's revenue comes from reading apps and sites;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● Sogou, China's third-biggest search engine, has said it is likely to seek an IPO with a valuation of as much as US$5 billion this year. Backed by Tencent and </span><span class="s3">Sohu.com</span><span class="s1">, its chief executive Wang Xiaochuan told Bloomberg the firm plans to use part of the IPO proceeds to improve search results by investing in artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies; and</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">● </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, the online finance arm of Alibaba has said it is likely to seek an IPO, although the venue is still unknown. The company is valued at US$60 billion following its US$4.5 billion fundraising round last year. Jack Ma Yun, Alibaba's founder, said last year that </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> focuses on serving the under banked and unbanked in developing countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the owner of South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, China's largest provider of on-demand services from food-delivery to ride-hailing, trumpeted its ambitions to push deep into mobility by acquiring Mobike, the country's biggest bicycle-sharing firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two companies confirmed the acquisition on Wednesday in a joint statement, saying they would be in a better position to fulfill their mission of making people “eat better and live better”. A person briefed on the terms said </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> is paying US$2.7 billion for Mobike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobike will operate as an independent entity and brand after the takeover. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> CEO Wang Xing will become chairman of the board at Mobike, with Wang Xiaofeng remaining as CEO. The other two senior executives of Mobike, Hu Weiwei and Xia Yiping, will remain president and chief technology officer, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mobike will help </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> customers to go to restaurants, go back home and travel around, becoming the best connection in forming a closed-loop shopping experience,” Wang said in an internal employee memo later published on </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> account. Hu Weiwei, a co-founder of Mobike, said in a </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> post that “it is a new beginning” and that there's “huge space for imagination” to work with </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's internet companies are expanding beyond their traditional confines as they seek to cross-sell products and services to their </span><span class="s3">users.Meituan</span><span class="s1"> is the world's fourth largest unicorn with a valuation of US$30 billion, behind Xiaomi and above </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> in the ranking, according to CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> started off as a group-buying portal, before it merged with Dianping, a restaurant recommendation site. The combined entity is now pushing into food delivery and recently introduced ride-hailing in several Chinese cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal comes amid the further consolidation of the bicycle-sharing industry in China and </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">'s ramped up effort to expand into the country's transportation-on-demand sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bicycle-sharing has took off in late 2016 in China with dozens of startups placing millions of two-wheelers on city sidewalks, funded by venture capital money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake is an industry that is potentially worth about 24 billion yuan (US$3.8 billion) by 2019, according to market research firm iResearch. Beyond the rental revenue and prospects for advertising, bike-sharing companies are also seen by Chinese tech giants as effective tools to promote mobile payments and to collect user data that in theory can be analysed for consumer patterns useful for a broader internet-enabled transportation industry that involves ride-hailing and the rental business of cars, motorbike and bicycles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The acquisition will give Mobike a bigger backer in </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> as itpursues market dominance in bicycle sharing against its competitor Ofo, according toZhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The tie-up with Mobike is also expected to help </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> gain more customers data to help its push into transportation,” Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobike raised US$600 million last June in a financing round led by Tencent, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Mobike combination. Mobike's chief competitor Ofo is backed by e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns theSouth China Morning Post. Ofo said it did not have a comment for now, when asked how the </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Mobike acquisition will affect its strategy.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consumers in China are waiting longer for more significant upgrades in features before replacing their smartphones, contributing to a slowdown in sales in the world's largest mobile handset market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major Chinese smartphone firms are expected to increase their combined market share on the mainland this year, with the gains coming at the expense of small suppliers after the country recorded its first decline in smartphone shipments last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“More of the smaller smartphone players will be forced to exit the market in 2018 as we expect handset shipments in China to continue declining,” said Tay Xiaohan, a senior market analyst at technology research firm IDC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smartphone sales in China are dominated by the top five brands - </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Apple - with a 77 per cent share of the market, up from 67 per cent in 2016, according to Counterpoint.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major shake-up seen as Chinese smartphone market contracts for the first time ever[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2130690/major-shake-seen-chinese-smartphone-market-contracts-first-time-ever]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These larger, deep-pocketed Chinese smartphone suppliers have won a big chunk of the market through aggressive marketing, more attractive handset designs and features, and by offering a wider array of models available in a range of prices to entice both younger and affluent buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That leaves an estimated 200 Chinese smartphone companies to fight for the scraps. Just two years ago, there were as many as 300 of these firms offering inexpensive, knock-off handsets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Demand in China had doubled each year between 2010 and 2012 during the period when 3G mobile services were being rolled out across the country, but gradually slowed down from 2013 ahead of the deployment of faster 4G services by the mainland's three mobile network operators.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data from IDC showed that smartphone shipments on the mainland decreased 4.9 per cent to 444.3 million units last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In 2017, the minor upgrades that Chinese smartphone companies made to their offerings were not enough to move consumers to splurge on new models, resulting in a general slowdown in the market,” IDC's Tay said. “A key space to look out for in the coming year would be how the top smartphone companies seek to [drive consumer upgrades] through their US$200 products.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The top-20 smartphone brands control 93 per cent of the market,” said Counterpart research director Neil Shah. “That means 180 other brands are competing for just the remaining seven per cent share, which means we could see a potential exit for some of these firms this year.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the slowdown in China “has caused serious pain for tier-2 and tier-3 smartphone brands, such as Gionee, Coolpad and LeEco, which largely depend on domestic sales”. A further slowdown this year would make it more difficult for these companies to compete in terms of scale in component supply deals for production and in marketing, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With fewer marketing resources at their disposal, small Chinese smartphone companies will be absent at this year's edition of Mobile World Congress (MWC), the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, to be held in Barcelona, Spain, from February 26 to March 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year's absentees include Meizu, Gionee and Coolpad, which took part the past three years, and LeEco, which was at the event in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Meizu's domestic market share decreased last year, a spokesman said on Thursday that the company was profitable last year as its international sales have grown by more than 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Meizu's rapid international growth is set to continue in 2018, and we're already in talks with a number of potential partners to bring our products to even more countries next year,” the spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gionee declined to make any further comment from what its chief executive recently made public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coolpad did not respond to direct messages left on the firm's </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese smartphone brands have succeeded in competing against the likes of Apple and </span><span class="s3">Samsung Electronics</span><span class="s1"> chiefly by heavy marketing and offering similar design and features at a lower price. But that strategy has its limitations as most of these brands “are too identical to stand out from others”, said Zhao Ziming, a senior analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Cyzone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reliance on heavy marketing to gain buyers has burdened these brands with unsustainable costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Examples of lavish marketing programmes include hiring top celebrities for major advertising campaigns online, on television shows and in billboards prominently displayed at airports, undergrounds and bus stations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cat Fu, a smartphone vendor in Shenzhen's electronics-manufacturing hub of Huaqiangbei, said most retailers now only sell smartphone brands that are well established.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gionee, which is based in Shenzhen, had recently been the most active in marketing and promotions among the small Chinese smartphone brands.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November last year, Gionee threw down the gauntlet to Apple and its rival brands in China by releasing a family of full-screen smartphones, the cheapest of which sells for a tenth of the price of the iPhone X. At that time, Gionee said it was the world's first smartphone supplier to equip all new handsets with full 18:9 aspect ratio displays.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, however, a court in the southern coastal city of Dongguan froze for two years the 41.4 per cent stake in Gionee of company chairman and chief executive Liu Lirong because of the firm's failure to repay a number of its suppliers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu recently said that the company had overextended itself after spending a combined 9 billion yuan (US$1.4 billion) in marketing and investments over the past three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">O-film Tech</span><span class="s1">, a maker of touch screens as well as fingerprint identification and video head modules, said Gionee owed the company payments totalling 626 million yuan as of February 6 this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gionee's troubles followed those of LeEco. The cash-strapped internet conglomerate and smartphone supplier founded by entrepreneur Jia Yueting last year retreated from its expansion in the United States and abandoned its US$2 billion purchase of American television maker Vizio amid a mountain of debt, huge losses and court orders freezing its assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coolpad, the struggling smartphone company controlled by LeEco, last year was sued by Ping An Bank to repay a loan worth 80 million yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi targets return to No 1 spot in China's smartphone market in 10 quarters[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2132467/xiaomi-targets-return-no-1-spot-chinas-smartphone-market-10]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Counterpoint's Shah estimated that smartphone shipments in China last year for Gionee, Coolpad and LeEco were down by 25 per cent, 77 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively, from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These brands have fallen off the cliff,” he said. “They need to pull off a comeback. similar to Xiaomi's, but that looks very difficult.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Xiaomi was once the world's most valuable unicorn - a start-up worth more than US$1 billion - and top smartphone supplier in China. The company's smartphone sales, however, hit a severe slump in 2016, which senior management blamed on supply chain issues caused by its rapid expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which raised a US$1 billion loan from a syndicate of banks last year, recently set itself a goal of retaking the top spot in the domestic market within 10 quarters, backed by a strategy to build up the number of its bricks-and-mortar stores to complement the firm's online retail platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China, the world's largest consumer electronics market, is the foundation of Xiaomi, and the high ground that global smartphone makers are vying for,” Xiaomi founder and chief executive Lei Jun said earlier this month. “Only if we win the local market can we continue to support steady expansion overseas.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Experience running an ultra marathon can be a hindrance when knowing what is coming adds to the nerves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Australian ultra runner Ben Duffus has been out with an injury for so long, he has almost forgotten what running 50 kilometres is like.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Sunday, he will take on the 9 Dragons 50km race in Hong Kong - his first ultra marathon in over a year after suffering a bulged disk in his back.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[When you've been injured] you haven't experienced it in a while so you are sort of back to being a beginner when ignorance is bliss and you don't know what you're in for,” Duffus said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But on the other hand, he is hungry to get back on the trails, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 9 Dragons is a two-day race. On Saturday, runners take on 50 miles (80km) and on Sunday they race again on a 50km route. They can do both, or one race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The race follows a route and a legend. Local myths say in the 13th century, an Emperor visited Kowloon. Noticing the eight hills - Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill, Crow's Nest - the Emperor named them the “Eight Dragons”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A quick-witted courtier pointed out that the Emperor was a dragon himself, making it nine dragons, not eight, according to the race website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first race involves 4,000 metres of elevation, and the second has 3,200m. With some of the shortest cut-off times between check points, it is one of the hardest races in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's about finding that red line between what you can do and what you can't do,” said Duffus, who came second in the Ultra Trail Australia 2016. “If I can get close to that, keep the pace sustainable, keep the mindset positive, and get the nutrition right then the time will look after itself.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kellie Emmerson will be running races on both days. This is her first race since the Ultra Marathon of Mont Blanc in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the 170km race took a toll on her body, and she has been recovering since.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was the hardest race of my life, it was very cold,” Emmerson said. “I had never been on my feet for 15 hours before, and I almost doubled that. I had never run at minus-10 degrees Celsius before.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Emmerson has picked a bold race as her first event back. She has run stage races before, but has never run such long distances back-to-back.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think Sunday will hurt a lot. But it's OK, I'm prepared for that pain,” she said, and with her compression gear and a lot of hydration she will be able to enjoy the second race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I am looking forward to exploring a new place, and a lot of pain and a lot of stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both runners expressed nerves about the impending staircases notorious in Hong Kong trail running.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Duffus said: “I knew there were a lot of stairs ... It's one thing to know it, it is another thing to experience.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing ByteDance Technology, the operator of China's dominant news aggregator Toutiao, has bought social video app Musical.ly, its second acquisition in a week as it aggressively seeks new users by widening its range of content offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ByteDance did not give financial details of the deal in a statement on Friday, but Chinese media reports said the acquisition of Musical.ly, an app especially popular with teenagers that allows users to post videos of themselves accompanying their favourite songs, was valued at between US$800 million and US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal is expected to boost ByteDance's presence overseas, adding Musical.ly's around 100 million users worldwide - according to media reports - to Toutiao's 120 million, most of whom are white-collar workers in smaller cities in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“By integrating Musical.ly's global reach with ByteDance's massive user base in China and key Asian markets, we are creating a significant global platform for our content creators and brands to engage with new markets,” said Zhang Yiming, founder and chief executive of ByteDance, in the statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the same time, our world-leading artificial intelligence technology will help Musical.ly to accelerate their incredible pace of innovation in mobile video creation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The acquisition is the latest overseas venture for ByteDance, a Beijing-based start-up founded in 2012 which ranks 12th in the CB Insights' Global Unicorn Club list with a valuation of US$11 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this week ByteDance acquired news and video aggregation platform News Republic from China's Cheetah Mobile - itself an early investor in Musical.ly - for US$86.6 million. In February it bought US video creation app </span><span class="s3">Flipagram</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ByteDance said Musical.ly will continue to operate as an independent platform, but the two will work together to extend Musical.ly's reach in China and around Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ByteDance's Toutiao app uses AI to analyse readers' habits and send them customised content. It also runs TopBuzz, an English-language news app similar to Toutiao.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, Baidu, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, Weibo: they are among the biggest giants of China's internet. Providing everything from search and messaging to shopping and financial services to hundreds of millions of users each day, these and other Chinese technology companies dominate Chinese cyberspace every bit as much as </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> monopolise the web in the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is one important difference between China's tech behemoths and their US counterparts. The likes of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1">, Apple, </span><span class="s3">Netflix</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> don't just dominate the online lives of their users in the US. They also dominate the stock portfolios. Last year, the benchmark US S&amp;P 500 stock index climbed 19 per cent. Of that performance, a quarter was delivered by this small quintuplet of tech stocks, the so-called FAANGs, which on average rose 57 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In sharp contrast, China's own national internet champions don't figure at all in the portfolios of mainland Chinese investors. Shares in Alibaba, Baidu and Weibo, to name three, are publicly listed, but on US, rather than mainland Chinese stock exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That hasn't detracted from their share price performance, which has been just as impressive as that of the FAANGs. Last year, shares in Weibo, for example, leapt by 149 per cent. But with access to US markets forbidden by China's regulations, mainland investors, who love nothing better than a hot tech stock, have badly missed out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Until now. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities published regulations to govern the listing on mainland exchanges of so-called Chinese depositary receipts, or CDRs. These instruments will, for the first time, allow ordinary Chinese investors to buy a stake in their favourite technology giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first CDRs will hit the market in the middle of July, when Xiaomi, the world's fourth largest smartphone maker, launches its US$10 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong. As part of that deal, the company plans to issue CDRs worth up to US$3 billion in the mainland market. Other Chinese technology stars are tipped to follow in rapid succession.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is a catch. The new securities are called CDRs in emulation of the American Depositary Receipts, which, over recent decades have so successfully allowed US shareholders to invest in the equity of non-US companies. However, there is a crucial difference between ADRs and CDRs, which will greatly complicate the CDR investment story.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ADRs are fully fungible with their underlying shares. This means new ADRs can be created (or deleted) in line with market demand. If the demand is there, brokers bundle up shares listed in the company's home country and lodge them with a depositary bank, which then issues receipts that can be traded in the US. As a result, ADRs always trade in line with the price of their underlying shares, as any significant divergence in price would instantly be arbitraged away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, a company's CDRs will not be fungible with its primary shares listed offshore. In effect they will be an entirely new class of stock, not securities created by bundling together underlying shares. That means their supply will be inflexible, not adjustable like the supply of ADRs. And because arbitrage between the mainland's markets and markets offshore is difficult at best, and often impossible, large price discrepancies are likely to open up between a company's CDRs and its primary shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's not difficult to guess which way these discrepancies will tilt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Demand for the new CDRs will be enormous. Chinese investors are just as keen on tech stocks, probably keener, than their US counterparts. But supply will be limited. For one thing, issuing companies will be anxious not to overly dilute their existing shareholders in offshore markets. And not only will brokers be prohibited from creating new units on demand, but a sizeable proportion of CDR issues will be reserved for six new “unicorn funds” backed by state institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In theory, retail investors will be able to invest in these funds. But a cap on investment and their mandatory three-year lock-up period will put many off. As a result, most ordinary investors will either have to be lucky enough to win an allocation in the initial offering, or they will be left to scramble for CDRs in the secondary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An initial allocation is highly unlikely: last month's mainland Chinese IPO for Foxconn Industral Internet was oversubscribed by almost 300 times. And competition in the secondary market will be intense. China's regulators cap the valuation of new issues. And in any case, CDR issuers will be careful to issue the new securities at the same valuation as their offshore shares, lest they be accused of gouging investors. As a result, to Chinese investors, the new securities will look like a steal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu, for example, is trading in the US on a price-earnings ratio of 35. In contrast, Chinese-listed information technology stocks are trading at a median valuation of 52. And many are trading at much, much richer valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, Shenzhen-listed satellite positioning services company </span><span class="s3">Beijing BDStar Navigation</span><span class="s1"> is currently on a price-earnings ratio of 139.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, when CDRs hit the market, we can expect the same sort of buying frenzy that pushed shares in Foxconn's subsidiary up by 44 per cent on its first day of trading. And it won't just be the first day. Such spectacular gains generate a momentum of their own as they attract still more buyers to the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The typical new listing on the mainland trades limit-up for 10 days in a row, rising 150 per cent. The most popular new issues - which will surely include CDR offerings from well-known tech giants - typically trade limit-up for almost four weeks in a row after listing, rising by more than 400 per cent in price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That might not sound like a problem. But there is a big probability that a spate of popular CDR issues coming to market in quick succession will inflate the sort of broader momentum-driven stock market bubble that in 2015 saw the entire Shenzhen market climb double in just three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If so, it is likely that the authorities will again step in to try and dampen the market with ill-advised comments, mass stock suspensions, and heavy-handed regulatory tightening. In 2015, they precipitated a 50 per cent crash that saw many investors, locked in by suspensions, wiped out entirely. So if you are tempted to try and participate in the mainland's coming CDR boom, be prepared for a wild ride. ■</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 50 companies from across the world have expressed interest in applying for virtual bank licences, with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> setting August 31 as the deadline for receiving applications for the first batch of purely online banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have set up a special team to handle the applications,” HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen Kwok-hang told a media briefing after Hong Kong's de facto central bank and regulator issued the guidelines on Wednesday. “For those who want to be among the first batch of applicants, they should submit the application before the end of August.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuen said he was not be sure if all these 50 firms would submit applications, although many of them had already given some initial information about their business plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies came from Hong Kong, the mainland and elsewhere,” Yuen said and hoped that the first licences could be issued by the end of this year or the first quarter of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA will scrutinise the IT platform of the applicants, the viability of their business plans and their financial background.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now that the guidelines have been issued the applicants can formally apply for a licence immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simon Loong, co-founder of the home-grown fintech unicorn WeLab, who had previously told the Post that his company would be among the first applicants for a virtual banking licence, welcomed the move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe the HKMA has provided clear guidance on the expectations for the operational and risk management of a virtual bank, to facilitate the application process for interested applicants such as WeLab,” Loong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now that the HKMA has set out the clear criteria for priority handling of virtual bank applications ... we will strive to be in the first batch of applicants for the virtual banking licence in Hong Kong and continue to promote financial inclusion and Fintech development in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The virtual banking regulations are not much different from the proposals set forth for consultations in February, with all 25 respondents including the Hong Kong Association of Banks, and the Consumer Council supporting the proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab joins fintech race to become Hong Kong's first licensed virtual bank[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2144899/welab-joins-fintech-race-become-hong-kongs-first-licensed]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam last September announced plans to introduce virtual banks in Hong Kong to usher in a “new era of smart banking”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Virtual banks looking to set up in Hong Kong will need to have at least HK$300 million (US$38.36 million) in capital, and cannot impose a minimum account balance or low balance fees. They cannot charge excessively high interest rates or engage in over-aggressive strategies to compete for market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although these virtual banks will only operate online, the authority requires them to have at least one physical office that can also handle complaints from customers. They would need to have an exit plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuen also said the HKMA was yet to set a cap for issuing licences and that some conventional banks had expressed interest in applying for a virtual bank licence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expects the virtual banks to offer simple services such as deposits and lending for individuals and SMEs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's best will be arrayed in force on Sunday at Sha Tin as they begin their campaigns towards the internationals in December, and John Moore says his big-race bridesmaid Irian can cause a surprise in the Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The imposing figure of the Tony Millard-trained Ambitious Dragon, two-times Horse Of the Year, stands atop a Sha Tin Trophy field that also includes the winners of last season's Champions Mile, Hong Kong Cup, Derby and Champions &amp; Chater Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ambitious Dragon is the likely favourite, and as such, will be out to turn over more than two decades of history. No outright favourite has won the race since 1990, with upset victors all the way up to Packing Winner's 160-1 shock three years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moore has sorted out jockeys for his six runners in this weekend's race and nominated Brett Prebble's mount Irian as the one who could cause the upset this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They are all well but I'd say Irian is going to run a whopper," Moore said yesterday. "Xtension might just need this run, having in mind we want him to peak on international day, and the same is true of Zaidan. Military Attack has a light weight and he could be a knockout for that reason, but he isn't trained up yet."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moore is basing his expectations of Irian on having found a cure for the gelding "speedy cutting", a term that refers to a horse's hooves making contact with his other feet or legs during his running action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We've got Irian's shoeing right again so that he doesn't speedy cut himself and he has been very impressive in his work," Moore said. "I know 2,000 metres probably is his best distance, but Irian has been effective from a mile up so I think he'll run a great race."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Group Three Premier Bowl for the sprinters has not exactly been a picnic for punters: Cheerful Fortune was the last outright favourite to win that, nine years ago, and John Size stunned horseplayers last year with Rich Unicorn's 64-1 win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moore will have four runners there, too, after switching Majestic Falcon from the Class Two event, where he would have been a reserve runner. He will join stablemate Captain Sweet, Leading City and Able Speed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab, Hong Kong's home-grown fintech unicorn, is poised to be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking license from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, according to its co-founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have been working closely with the HKMA over the consultation of the virtual banking regulation over the past few months. We would like to be among the first to file a formal application for a virtual banking license which I believe would be an important step forward for the development of smart banking in Hong Kong,” saidSimon Loong Pui-chi, the founder and chief executive of WeLab in an exclusive interview with theSouth China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the coming weeks, the HKMA [https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-monetary-authority-hkma] is due to issue guidelines for virtual banking regulation based on a consultation in February. Expectations are for the first licenses to be issued by the end of the year. The HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam last September announced plans to introduce virtual banking in Hong Kong in what he described as a “new era of smart banking”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Monetary authority issues guidelines for the launch of virtual banks in Hong Kong [http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2132277/monetary-authority-issues-guidelines-launch-virtual-banks-hong-kong]Developing virtual banking in Hong Kong would also allow the city to catch up with international marketsSimon Loong,founder of WeLab</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loong, 41, a native Hongkonger, co-founded WeLab with his 34-year old Taiwanese wife Frances Kang Tzu-ping and another partner, Kelly Wong, in 2013. In five years, the company has grown to 600 staff and 30 million customers in Hong Kong and mainland China. While Loong refused to talk about the company's valuation or listing plan, Hong Kong stockbrokers speculated the companycould have a valuation of more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the company operates online money lending platform WeLend. In the mainland, it has teamed with local partners to operate the online lending platform WoLaiDai. It plans to expand into Indonesia in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Getting a virtual banking license from the HKMA would allow us to expand our services. This would allow WeLab to diversify its business to become a full services bank,” Loong said. “Developing virtual banking in Hong Kong would also allow the city to catch up with international markets as many US and European markets already have pure online banking operators.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November WeLab raised US$220 million [http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2118976/hong-kong-fintech-firm-welab-raises-us220m-funding-round] from private investors in Hong Kong.WeLab's shareholders include Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, </span><span class="s3">International Finance Corp</span><span class="s1"> and other global banks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loong, a former banker with 15 years experience at institutions that include </span><span class="s3">Citibank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">, took a mid career break to pursue studies in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was joined by his then girlfriend and fellow banker Kang, who he met at </span><span class="s3">Citibank</span><span class="s1"> where she had worked for four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two took undertook studies at </span><span class="s3">Stanford University</span><span class="s1">, with Kang completing an MBA while Loong finished a master's degree in management. Loong and Kang were married in June 2012, a week after their final examinations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The newlyweds initially explored the idea of a start-up that would provide a platform to advise men on fashion choices and help source and deliver wardrobe updates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many Silicon Valley guys relied on their mothers or girlfriends to buy clothes for them. We considered whether we could help them to prepare a set of trendy clothes, matching their style and skin tone,” Kang recalled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But when they came back to Hong Kong, they found local men prefer shopping for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is true that Hong Kong needs more of a fintech revolution than a fashion revolution,” Kang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Back in 2012, we witnessed how Silicon Valley fintech companies were using technology to provide financial services at a lower cost and a more efficient manner.We considered a great opportunities in Hong Kong and the mainland by using big data and technology to offer financial services,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you go to a bank and ask for a loan for HK$500, banks are not interested because their operating cost is very high. They need to pay for rent of the branches and salaries. A banker said any loan below HK$200,000 (US$25,482) is not that profitable. This is why some individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises find it hard to get small loans,” Loong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeLab has lower overhead costs as it does not have any physical branches, while it also relies on technology to control risk and answer customers queries.The lender's average loans size in Hong Kong is about HK$80,000, whilemainland borrowers range between 8,000 yuan (US$1,257) to 10,000 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We use technology and big data to analysis risks and we use chatbots to answer customers' questions. Our system can use facial recognition to confirm the identity of the borrowers so as to prevent fraud. Our chatbot has answered 18 million queries,” Loong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While some people think technology cannot offer good customer service, our experience shows otherwise. Our core customers are aged between 20 to 35 years old. They do not want to deal with human operators, preferring instead to use an online platform from their mobile phone or computers to apply for loans.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Veteran securities regulator Huang Hongyuan has been appointed chairman of the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> , signalling Beijing's commitment to attracting technology companies and broadening links with international markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang, 54, will fill the vacancy left by Wu Qing who became a vice-mayor of Shanghai in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities regulator said in a statement on Sunday that Huang will carry the rank of vice-minister following the appointment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang's appointment was announced on Friday during a meeting in which </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> chairman Liu Shiyu urged exchange officials to make a priority of attracting high-quality companies to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange is actively seeking to attract technology companies with valuations of more than US$1 billion - as the central government encourages capital raising activities to help foster growth in the new economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> published a draft operating guide for the Chinese Depository Receipt (CDR) mechanism, a move intended to facilitate technology “unicorn” initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the CDR system, part of a company's shares are transferred to a custodian bank, which sells them on an exchange abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The role of the stock exchange's top boss is important now because of the task of luring technology firms,” said Zhou Ling, a fund manager with Shanghai Shiva Investment. “An official with experience in running the exchange is a proper choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, Beijing would appoint a senior </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> official to head the Shanghai exchange, rather than promoting an official from within the managerial ranks of the exchange as chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang became executive vice-president of the Shanghai exchange in 2011 before he was nominated president the following year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between 1992 and 2011, he served at the </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1">, assuming a number of roles, including director of the risk management office and deputy director of the fund supervision department.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">CSRC</span><span class="s1"> did not say who will take up the position vacated by Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luring unicorns is part of an effort to support transition of the Chinese economy into a sustainable growth model driven by entrepreneurship and consumer spending.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, major Chinese technology companies conducted IPOs on overseas markets such as Hong Kong and New York because their ownership structure was not in compliance with mainland requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai bourse is also working with its London counterpart to establish a stock connect that will allow investors to trade shares on each other's markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing. Have something to say? Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Jockey Club handicappers agree, lifting Beauty Generation's local rating to an astonishing 137 after Sunday's win in the Group Two Sha Tin Vase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To put that in perspective, that is the highest domestic rating since Able Friend had 138 (which he earned after winning the Premier Bowl in 2015).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It easily eclipses the marks held by the likes of Mr Stunning, Thewizardofoz, Ivictory, D B Pin (all 128) during their reigns as the highest-rated horses in Hong Kong, while he is also clear of Good Ba Ba and Sacred Kingdom (131), Silent Witness (132), Military Attack and Designs On Rome (133), Ambitious Dragon and Fairy King Prawn (134). That is a who's who of recent Hong Kong racing history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Electronic Unicorn, the superstar from the early 2000s, was another who reached the heights of 138.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That just goes to show the exalted company Beauty Generation is in and the merit of his two victories this season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, there are some differing opinions about how strong Beauty Generation's hold on the Hong Kong Mile is.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From a weights and measures perspective, he looks unbeatable - he has given weight to all his rivals and still been far too good for them. Given only one international raider (Maurice) has upstaged the locals in the past 12 editions, it looks like he has one hand on the trophy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beauty Generation's dominance won't keep raiders away from Hong Kong International Races: John Moore[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2169559/beauty-generations-dominance-wont-keep-raiders-away-hong-kong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But others (including some trainers and ratings experts), believe Beauty Generation is only thriving because of how the races are being run - low pressure contests that suit him down to the ground. If there is an injection of pace to challenge the six-year-old early, then he could come unstuck and it would open things up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Equally, there are differing views to the amount of pressure Beauty Generation faced on Sunday, even though the overall time was just .36 of a second outside Good Ba Ba's 1,600m track record (set in 2008).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year's HK Horse of the Year stakes his claim to be the world's highest-rated miler in the Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy: Beauty Generation refuses to yield as Singapore Sling challenges to record one of the best HK handicap performances of the modern era. #HKracing[https://twitter.com/hashtag/HKracing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] pic.twitter.com/y1GG7zpdf5[https://t.co/y1GG7zpdf5]— </span><span class="s3">HKJC</span><span class="s1"> Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 21, 2018[https://twitter.com/HKJC_Racing/status/1053934226804883458]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jockey Zac Purton thought he was pestered all the way, Chad Schofield said "it was a shame Beauty Generation wasn't softened up a bit more”. It is a game of opinions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In any case, Beauty Generation is a "champion”[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2169550/john-moores-beauty-generation-enters-champion-class-blistering-sha-tin] - John Moore's description - and if he can hold his form through to the December, he is going to be incredibly tough to beat.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking of ratings, Frankie Lor's star four-year-old went up 10 points (to 106) after his impressive return on Sunday and he looks the one they have to catch in the Group Three Sa Sa Ladies' Purse on November 4.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purton believes Glorious Forever still has plenty to learn, but if he can perform like that when there is still more upside, then good luck to the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time Warp's brother Glorious Forever continues to do a striking impression of his older sibling and destroys a smart field in R4 from a mark of 96 under @zpurton[https://twitter.com/zpurton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw].

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He's obviously got an engine, he's a talented horse but once again he never really relaxed either, he was on the bit all the way,” Purton said after the race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been plenty of talk comparing Glorious Forever to his full-brother, two-time Group One winner Time Warp, which is only natural given their front-running styles and development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Glorious Forever eyes big brother Time Warp's Hong Kong Cup crown after blistering win[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2169538/glorious-forever-eyes-big-brother-time-warps-hong-kong-cup-crown-after]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the questions has been "who will Zac ride?” when they clash - and it looks like they will in the Ladies' Purse - but Purton might get to delay the choice as he won't be able to make the weight to partner Glorious Forever (who is likely to get 113 pounds).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Assuming the younger brother takes out the Ladies' Purse, his rating will be high enough to ensure he gets a run in the Hong Kong Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given he makes his own luck, he would certainly be in the market, but there is a lot of water to go under the bridge.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The championships have got a business as usual look about them with Douglas Whyte and John Size putting the foot down on the accelerator in recent meetings, but it was the dead-heat win for Fulfil A Wish in the Chevalier Cup that gave Size the most satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holyangelholy and promising Happy Era saw Size and Whyte notch a double together earlier in the card, but Fulfil A Wish arrived just in time to claim half of the feature with Ben So Tik-hung aboard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fulfil A Wish and the Tony Cruz-trained outsider Penglai Xianzi (Vincent Ho Chak-yiu) couldn't be separated on the wire in a blanket finish to an event that was a far cry from when Size first took it out 11 years ago with top-class miler Electronic Unicorn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But I'm happy with a deadheat because I thought he'd got beaten - and I'm happy to win anything with Fulfil A Wish because it really has been tough for him to win at this level he's at now," Size said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He's so honest, he doesn't lose any points, he just tries. He in there giving it his best all the time and when a race comes along where none of the others is really flying - which is what we had today - then he's able to get into the finish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Last three starts I've asked him to run a mile and he's tried hard, and 1,800m and he's tried hard and back to 1,400m and he does his best wherever you put him. Ben rode him well and he was able to get a win, but I'm not sure what the next trick will be."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The same was probably true of many of the runners, including the other dead-heater Penglai Xianzi, who had been battling since his rating went into three figures last season and only half-a-length covered the first five home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unbeaten Happy Era is a different matter altogether, with the rising four-year-old taking himself out of Class Three at his third start with another tradesmanlike performance in the seventh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He's got speed to put himself in a position, he could travel a little better through his races but that's just him, then when you ask him to pick up he does it. He's not much to look at but he's shown some quality to win three out of three and quite quickly - not many do that here," said Size, although he said the Classic Mile may come too soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There isn't much time between now and the middle of January and Happy Era would need to find some more ratings points to put himself into a race like that."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whyte said the gelding's professionalism was going to help him to punch above his weight even as Happy Era got higher in the ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He didn't have it that easy today, I had to use him a little to get around Lucky Warrior early, but when he got there he just went to sleep," Whyte said. "Those manners will take him a fair way and he feels like he'll be better at a mile and maybe further."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seven Seas Partners, a venture capital firm founded by Tencent Holdings' former chief technology officer, has led a 350 million yuan (US$53.6 million) funding round in a Chinese start-up, betting big to find the next Chinese tech giant in the robot sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funding for Roobo, a Beijing start-up that sells conversational service robots, would lift the firm's valuation close to that of a unicorn - private companies valuated at US$1 billion or more, according to the company's chief executive Liu Yingbo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from the capital injection announced on Wednesday, Jeff Xiong Minghua, who was Tencent's CTO for eight years until his departure from the social networking giant in 2013, will also serve as the chairman of the board of Roobo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I really hope that I can find and cultivate the next Tencent in China. The thing that I regretted most when leaving Tencent was that I didn't help turn the company into a truly globalised company, ” said Xiong. He said the artificial intelligence (AI) era provided China with real opportunities to produce global companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multibillion-dollar valuation are very likely to be those involved in service robotics and the Internet of Things, as Xiong estimates that there will be 10 billion smart devices in use in China, with more hardware - from home appliances to cars - being connected to the internet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment comes amid the rising interest in AI in China, where the central government has unveiled a top-down nationwide plan in July through a three-step approach to become a global AI leader by 2030.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiong joining its board, Roobo has also announced its transformation from an AI product company to an AI platform company that provides AI solutions ranging from chips, operating systems to cloud services to allow home appliance makers and robot producers to tap into their technologies to build their own AI products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Money is not an issue for us. What we want is to bring Jeff's experience and vision in tech industry to make us into a big player in China and abroad,” said Liu, Roobo's chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said the company's monthly revenue this year had almost reached its full year revenue for 2016, without giving further details.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you listen to the trainers of Ambitious Dragon and Glorious Days - the leading chances for tomorrow's Longines Hong Kong Mile - the mutual admiration flows so freely you could easily get the impression they would switch horses for one race if they could.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A day after Glorious Days' handler, John Size, declared Ambitious Dragon "unbeatable" if the two-time defending Horse of the Year brings his 'A' game, his trainer Tony Millard returned serve, saying his up-and-coming rival "has the race at his mercy".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Frankly speaking, the way that horse is going, Glorious Days will be very, very difficult to beat," Millard said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He has got everything going his way. He has improved, he is young and he has drawn perfectly in gate three. As much as I am happy with my horse - you've got to have respect for him."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have fought two thrilling domestic duels already this term, finishing one-two both times. Ambitious Dragon dominated first-up, before a move to blinkers by Size coaxed a career-best performance from Glorious Days in the Jockey Club Mile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He just improved so much last start. I wish I had a set of blinkers like that," Millard joked, before adding that the fancied pair's disparate draws - Ambitious Dragon jumps from gate 11 - further swung things in Glorious Days' favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Douglas Whyte will dictate the race from that draw," Millard said. "In saying that, I'm pretty comfortable with our draw, too. We've run our best races from out there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Whenever we've been on the outside, he's been under pressure. It's tough on the inside, because you can get blocked or race too close."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Ambitious Dragon failed in his three biggest races last season - all international Group Ones, including the Hong Kong Cup as 2.1 favourite - international day 2012 has steadily shaped as a date with destiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Millard didn't buy into the suggestion his horse's performance would define his legacy, and avoid him being labelled a "backyard bully".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He is just phenomenal. It's every trainer's dream to have a horse like this, one that is so versatile," he said. "He has done enough in my eyes and is as good as I can have him. He worked nice this morning and is going super. I couldn't be more happy with him going into this race, but you've just got to respect Mr Size's horse."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Size himself is looking to get a monkey off his back. The seven-time champion trainer has finished runner-up in the Mile three times; with Armada in 2006 and Electronic Unicorn in 2001 and 2002. "I'd like to put it right," he said. Even though Glorious Days' rating peaked in the Jockey Club Mile - and there is the chance of a dip in his performance this time out - Size said his horse had maintained a healthy appearance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He seems OK and he has done well since the Jockey Club Mile," he said. "It looked a tough run for him, and a good performance, but he seems the same at home."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As much as Size is a fan of Millard's horse, he feels a performance from Glorious Days equal to that of last start should be enough to break his drought in the feature race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If he can repeat it, that should be enough to win the race. I don't have too many concerns, it's an ideal draw on paper," he said.</span></p>
