<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total funds raised in the Hong Kong stock market have dropped to an eight-year low but the city still ranks top as the largest IPO market worldwide, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A combined total of just US$39.4 billion was raised in Hong Kong through initial public offerings (IPO), share placements, rights issues and other offerings this year, down 57 per cent from US$91.68 billion in 2015. It's the lowest amount raised in the local stock market since the financial crisis in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised in Hong Kong through IPO dropped by 26 per cent to US$24.35 billion, compared with US$33 billion last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is, however, still enough for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to rank No.1 among global IPO markets this year, the second consecutive year it has taken the top spot. The funds raised in Hong Kong, according to the data, beat </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in second place with US$16 billion and </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on US$11.87 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">'s ChiNext, the Chinese equivalent of the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, ranked the 10th biggest IPO market worldwide, with US$3.99 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/12/27/490f2b1a-cc08-11e6-96db-a1eec4097f76_image_hires.jpg]Joseph Tong, chairman of Morton Securities, said the IPO market and other fund raising channels have been hurt by poor market sentiment.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year was full of surprises and uncertainties, with the Brexit vote result in June and Donald Trump winning the US president election. China's economic slowdown and the weak yuan also hurt overall investment sentiment,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The devaluation of the yuan has led Beijing to introduce measures to prevent capital outflow. This has slowed down the process for companies and individuals to bring their money out of the country to invest in a new listing or any share placement in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily market turnover this year stood at HK$67.396 billion, down 36 per cent from HK$105.63 billion last year, according to HKEX statistics.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the outlook is not optimistic either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new US president Donald Trump will take office in January and his policies are still unknown. There will be a lot of presidential elections in many European countries. These uncertainties would hurt market sentiment and hence the funds raised in local stock markets next year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benny Mau, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, is also less than sanguine about the equity market funds likely to be raised next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US Fed has increased the interest rate this month and predicted it will increase the interest rate at least three more times. This is not going to encourage investors to buy new shares in the market,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the yuan down almost 7 per cent against the US dollar this year, China in recent months has brought in curbs stopping companies taking large amounts of money out of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the yuan is likely to continue to devaluate next year, it is inevitable that Beijing would continue to restrict the mainlanders or mainland companies from investing in the Hong Kong stock market. This has dried up turnover and made it harder to have many IPOs and placements next year,” Mau added.The US Fed has increased the interest rate this month and predicted it will increase it at least three more times. This is not going to encourage investors to buy new shares in the marketBenny Mau, Hong Kong Securities Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data shows Chinese companies still dominated new listings in Hong Kong, representing 80.5 per cent of all funds raised through IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ranking as the top IPO market this year is largely thanks to the mega listing of the Chinese state-owned </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC)</span><span class="s1">. The lender listed in September to raise US$7.6 billion, which is the largest IPO globally this year and also the world's largest IPO since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25.0 billion record offering in 2014 on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has three IPOs ranked in the top ten worldwide this year by funds raised. Aside from PSBC, there was </span><span class="s3">China Resources Pharmaceutical Group</span><span class="s1">'s US$1.9 billion IPO in October and China Zheshang Bank's US$1.9 billion listing in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong still lacks diversity in its IPO market. Financial companies represent 65.4 per cent of all IPO funds raised in Hong Kong, with the health care sector second at 9.4 per cent, industrials at 6.8 per cent, and consumer products and services sector ranked fourth at 4.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">High technology firms only ranked fifth at 3 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said Hong Kong's stock market would need to diversify to attract more new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many banks and traditional industrial players have listed in Hong Kong. HKEX should introduce a new board with more relaxed rules to attract more technology and new economy firms to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/12/27/15e1acac-cc0a-11e6-96db-a1eec4097f76_image_hires.jpg]Morgan Stanley was top among the investment banks underwriting all types of fund raising in the stock market with 11.3 per cent market share, followed by Haitong Securities on 5.9 per cent and Goldman Sachs on 5.4 per cent.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bond market did well this year, with Hong Kong dollar-denominated bonds raising a total of HK$166.3 billion, or US$21.4 billion, an increase of 74 per cent from a year ago and the highest issued since 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan-denominated dim sum bond market dropped to 146.8 billion yuan this year, which is the worst since the market began in 2011 and down 17.6 per cent from last year. Mau said the devaluation of the yuan has made investors hesitant to invest in yuan products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan is unlikely to bounce back next year although I believe the level of devaluation will not be substantial. This would affect the investors' interest in buying dim sum bonds or other yuan assets. This trend is likely to continue for a while next year,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When Anbang abruptly terminated its attempt to acquire US hotel chain Starwood in late March despite sweetening its offer several times in three weeks to upstage its rivals, many industry experts had said that the deal was being clocked by the Chinese authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, three months later when Anbang pulled out from another deal, after US authorities raised doubts about the insurer's company's shareholding and financing structure, there were many who felt that the crux of the problem was within the company itself.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Anbang's travails are not unique. In fact, it was following in the footsteps of several other Chinese companies who had paid hefty premiums to the offer price to outbid competition in mega deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They (Chinese buyers) tend to wait until the process has gone through and let the other buyers do the due diligence and price negotiations … and they would think ‘if it is good for other buyers, it is going to be good for us, so just add a bit and we can close the deal quickly',” said Itamar Har-Even, co-founder and co-CEO of Ion Pacific, who has participated in several deals involving Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the trick does not work always.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Announced overseas deals by Chinese companies this year has exceeded that of the whole of 2015, making China the world's biggest buyer of foreign companies for the first time ever. But there has also been a significant increase in the number of failures, according to Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not think that the curbs on capital outflows are a major obstacle,” said Har-Even. He later clarified his remarks, saying there are a number of other hurdles for Chinese companies besides capital outflow curbs. In fact, it is usually used as an excuse by some Chinese buyers when they find that financing is not as smooth as they expected, or if they are unprepared for the stringent regulatory approval process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar views are shared by Bee Chun Boo, a partner at the Beijing division of </span><span class="s3">Baker &amp; McKenzie</span><span class="s1">, a multinational law firm in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Boo said she personally does not see any problems in moving money overseas, particularly if it is a strategic M&amp;A deal, especially in sectors like technology. “The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) will have set the quota limits for various companies. So it is important for companies to ensure that they are within the quota limits,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peter Fuhrman, chairman of China First Capital, a mainland based investment bank and advisory firm, said it is important for Chinese companies to improve their shopping tactics. “Too often, Chinese buyers view cross-border M&amp;A as a rather costly form of department store shopping…while in the case of deals in the US and Europe, they need to have a completely different approach to convince regulators and institutional investors,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This talents and priorities, are not those of a retail shopper, but of a savvy political operator, who knows the rules and where to find the loopholes, knows how to lobby, how to buttonhole bureaucrats and sweet-talk a bunch of dour money managers,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is no regulatory problem with paying a ridiculously overvalued price to buy a property. But when you are eyeing an overseas-listed company, you cannot be completely incompetent and ignorant about overseas rules, an investment banker based in Shenzhen said on condition of anonymity.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan fell for a third consecutive day on Wednesday, with the market still worried about a proposed new tax to curb currency speculation and the central bank fixing the yuan reference price weaker for the third day in a row.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong and overseas markets weakened to 6.5187 to the US dollar on Wednesday morning before bouncing back to 6.5181 at 1.30pm , down 0.14 per cent from Tuesday when it weakened by 0.28 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency had its largest single-day fall in a month on Tuesday after reports Beijing was planning to introduce a "Tobin tax" to curb speculation. The tax takes its name from Nobel laureate economist James Tobin, who in 1972 suggested taking a cut of foreign exchange trades to limit currency speculation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, senior FX trader at </span><span class="s3">OANDA</span><span class="s1">, said the Tobin tax proposal had become the focus of the market.China fix fallout weighed negatively across the Asia-Pacific currenciesStephen Innes, </span><span class="s3">OANDA</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The big news out of mainland China was its Tobin tax proposal. This would slap a tax on currency transactions in an effort to curb speculation against the yuan," Innes said. "A move like that in my mind will undermine China's attempts to get the yuan fully accepted in the financial markets. And while it may offer some short-term stability or buffer to curb capital outflow, it will likely cripple the yuan's aspirations for internationalisation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">set the yuan mid-price at 6.5172 on Wednesday morning, weaker by 93 basis point from Tuesday when it was weaker by 166 basis point. It set the mid-price 8 basis point weaker on Monday after surprising the market by setting it stronger by 222 basis points on Friday, at the strongest level this year. The currency is allowed to be traded 2 per cent up or down the mid-price set by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Innes said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s weaker fixing caught the market's attention.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's housing market has made a robust recovery in the past 15 months on expansionary monetary policies, a new report says, but some analysts predict growth will slow as new cooling measures take effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The annual mainland real estate market survey by the </span><span class="s3">Urban Land Institute</span><span class="s1"> (ULI) — conducted with industry leaders in 33 of the largest Chinese cities — said official growth policies helped property prices surge in the year to June by an average of around 8.9 per cent, amid “significant reductions” in supply. Median new home inventory fell to just over six months for most cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And property prices will probably “continue to rise unless the government intervenes,” the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expansionary monetary policy as well as policies on home-purchase restrictions and down payment ratios clearly contributed to the housing market turnaround, but perhaps too drastically with some markets, including Shenzhen, Nanjing and Suzhou overheating as a result,” Kenneth Rhee, the report's author and ULI chief representative for the mainland, said in a press release.There will be more restrictions coming in the near future. Those restrictions will be a lot more surgicalKenneth Rhee, </span><span class="s3">Urban Land Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market watchers have long warned of the risk of a property bubble in China. Residential home prices slid in 2013 and 2014, but the government's heavy-handed approach to boosting the markets has led to overheating in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has already taken new measures to address this with new restrictions including increased down payment ratios and limits on property purchasing in around 20 cities in the past few weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rhee said at the launch of the ULI report on Tuesday that the government will continue introducing restrictions, some of which may differ even between districts within a city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There will be more restrictions coming in the near future,” he said. “Those restrictions will be a lot more surgical.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rhee's report also found that industry focus has shifted in the past year from residential to industrial properties, while results for the office, retail, and logistics sectors have been mixed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the development of high-speed railways has been “an increasingly important factor” for the market, particularly for the “growing number of tier 2 and tier 3 cities near major economic hubs such as the Yangtze River Delta.”What if there's a pop of the bubble? That will be a source of instabilityCharade Poon, director, M3 Capital</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai remains the leading Chinese city for investment and development prospects, according to ULI, topping the list ahead of Shenzhen, Beijing, and Guangzhou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Henry Chin, head of research for Asia Pacific at CBRE, said China is not going to see “rosy growth going forward.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two big risks for the market are the valuation of the renminbi, which fell to a six-year low this week, and capital outflow from the mainland as people seek to invest overseas, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the country's property market cycle is “getting very short,” there will definitely be investment opportunities in China's residential housing sector in the next year, according to Charade Poon, director at M3 Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you are saying whether there is opportunity to buy in the residential market right now, I would say maybe its not bad timing to get the dry powder ready,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he warned about the sustainability of the buyer base, adding that the effects of China's cooling measures “will overshoot” as they have in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What if there's a pop of the bubble?” he said. “That will be a source of instability.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chin, however, believes the property bubble is unlikely to burst.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Social stability is the number one agenda for the Communist Party. The next thing they don't want to see is the property price collapse,” he said. “[There is] also stronger demand for the tier 1 and tier 1.5 cities. I just don't see [a] market-wide collapse.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When bank governors of 10 of China's biggest banks gathered in a hotel in West Shanghai's Hongkou district on November 30 to protest against draft rules issued by regulators to consolidate the country's 100 trillion yuan (US$15 trillion) financial services industry under a single regulatory umbrella, they were worried the regulatory tightening, if not carried out gradually, was likely to backfire as interbank liquidity would drain too fast, causing defaults and lead to a chain of failures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts warn that although bearish sentiment on China had flipped in 2017, with its equities posting respectable gains, currency stabilising, and capital outflow curbed, some of the risks and challenges the country faces in the coming year must not be overlooked.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overtightening, which will send jitters from money markets to the property sector, is one of the key risks that China has to manage with caution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such risks have been given added urgency, as hundreds of China's most powerful policymakers gather for the annual Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) to plot the economic direction and strategies for Chinese President Xi Jinping's second five-year term.Obviously, the central government wants to defuse the financial risks fuelled by wild credit expansion in the past years, but they are also aware, and are being told by banks, that haste will backfireDexu, economics professor with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Obviously, the central government wants to defuse the financial risks fuelled by wild credit expansion in the past years, but they are also aware, and are being told by banks, that haste will backfire. It certainly needs cautious and nimble policies to achieve the goal,” said He Dexu, an economics professor with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">, China's top think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao Yang, chief China economist at Nomura, said that as the Chinese authorities push forward deleveraging and global central banks tighten their belts, further tightening in policy and liquidity will cause widening credit spread, diverged stock performance and surging risk premiums on the China market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors will see greater distinctions among good and bad companies, healthy and unhealthy banks, also industries relying or not relying on investment,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong, said it would be unwise to overlook the downside risks of infrastructure investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our impression as economists is that while the consensus used to be overly pessimistic towards China, now it is starting to turn a bit too optimistic,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Infrastructure spending had been used as the main tool by the government to set a stable economic backdrop for the leadership reshuffle during the 19th party congress in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/15/7248fc84-e180-11e7-af98-bc68401a7f65_image_hires_215022.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now as President Xi has consolidated his power, and is poised to lead the country to embrace “high-quality” growth, “policymakers might be able to accept slower growth for infrastructure spending from next year, as the growth in the past five years is unsustainable”, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“High-quality” growth is a growth pattern aligned more towards structural improvement rather than numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's housing market cools in January as policy tightening measures take effect[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2067876/chinas-housing-market-cools-january-policy-tightening-measures-take-effect]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists and analysts also differ on their views on the outlook for the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has seen a deep imbalance in the economy and high level of debt, both building up so quickly that has been “never seen anywhere else”, Peking University professor Michael Pettis told the Fortune China forum held in Guangzhou earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But unlike other countries where gross domestic product tracks the output of the economy, China's GDP is an input by the government to achieve the goals made in advance by taking on as much debt as possible, which is unsustainable, he argued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsinghua professor David Li Daokui disputes that. Li, who is also a former central bank adviser, said China's savings rate is two to three times that of the US and thus the debt level is way from scary, and the country still has great room for growth and stability as it is still busy building infrastructure, opening up its market while at the same time maintaining certain capital flow controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the GDP growth target made by Beijing for 2017 (around 6.5 per cent) is on track to be achieved - as the economy registered a growth rate at 6.9 per cent in the first three quarters, and is set to end the year at 6.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/15/71d9382c-e180-11e7-af98-bc68401a7f65_image_hires_215022.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economic policies that China will adopt in 2018</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, hundreds of top policymakers, regulators and provincial governors will meet in Beijing for the annual CEWC to discuss major economic tasks and policies, and most importantly, set the GDP growth target.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The growth target for 2018 could be announced by the CEWC, but it is likely to be flexible between 6 to 6.5 per cent, as more structural reforms, more policies to tackle pollution and income distribution problems put short-term pressure on growth,” said Nomura's Zhao, who projected around 6.4 per cent growth for 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IMF raises forecast for world economic growth in 2017 and 2018[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2114801/imf-raises-forecast-world-economic-growth-2017-and-2018]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> had revised China's GDP growth rate from 6.4 to 6.5 per cent in 2018, in its World Economic Outlook issued in late October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three key tasks for next year will include “addressing key risks and control macro leverage ratio, poverty reduction and significantly cut pollution emissions and improve the environment”, </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> reported after a Politburo meeting held on December 8.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The coming year will see China shift its priority to financial deleveraging and environmental protection from reducing industrial capacity and managing the housing market, as the last two sectors have been somewhat restored to health, said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia analyst at AXA Investment Managers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/15/71662ec2-e180-11e7-af98-bc68401a7f65_image_hires_215022.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Concerns about an overheating housing market have abated after the authorities rolled out measures to stop prices from spiralling out of control and with steel-capacity elimination achieving 76 per cent of its five-year target, an easing off on the de-capacity campaign would be understandable,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the official rhetoric and policy actions are becoming increasingly forceful on financial deleveraging and environment protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial draft rules introduced by regulators in November, which are now being resisted by banks, is a major ongoing mission aimed at mitigating a growing systemic risk to China's financial sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regards to environmental clean-up, authorities are closing down factories and turning off coal-fired boilers. Starting next year, local governors will face audits of their records on natural resource management and environmental protection, and be held accountable for damages even after they leave the position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Growth will decelerate in 2018, while policy operations will be bumpier as the authorities try to strike a balance between reforms and short-term stability, said Yao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If, and when, the two - reforms and stability preservation - are in conflict, we think the latter will take priority. Aggressive rate rises [due to deleveraging] and sharply cooling housing market [due to official tightening] will be duly countered by policy mitigation if they are seen as posing threats to macro stability,” he wrote in a note this week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan hit a one-month high on Friday as the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the mid-price sharply higher for the second day in a row and traders wound up their short positions ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday next week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan traded by international investors traded at 6.5633 per US dollar in early trade, the strongest level since January 13, before softening back to 6.5753 at 11.45am, edging down 0.01 per cent from Tuesday when it rose by 0.56 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan mid-price against the US dollar at a fresh one-month high of 6.5314 on Friday, stronger by 105 basis points than Thursday when it was stronger by 102 basis points. It has risen 0.3 per cent in the two days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade 2 per cent up or down from the mid-price set by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> at 9.15am. The mid-price is taken as a type of a guidance and they believe the central banks setting the mid-price higher two days in a row indicates it would like to see the yuan trade stronger today ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday next week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a weekly basis, the currency is poised to report a 0.22 per cent rise this week which would mark the fourth weekly rise in a row, offsetting the 1.72 deprecation in the first week of this year to bring the year-to-date loss to 0.16 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, a senior trader at </span><span class="s3">OANDA</span><span class="s1">, said the offshore yuan was so strong that it traded stronger than the onshore yuan at one stage. On Wednesday offshore yuan once hit a three-week low and traded a discount of more than 700 basis points to the onshore yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Friday's rise was due to some traders winding up their speculative short positions on the offshore yuan ahead of the Lunar New Year, which will start from Monday, with the Hong Kong market closing for three days and the mainland market closed for the whole week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Of course, one has to take these moves with a grain of salt as they're likely amplified by dwindling liquidity," Innes said. "At most, regional interbank players are likely to square off, or hedge, going into the Chinese Lunar New Year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Market expectations are running high now that we are nearing a devaluation in the US dollar and onshore yuan, which is primarily based on the huge capital outflow, as China continues to struggle with reforms and making adjustment to their currency policy regime."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar rose for the third day in a row to trade at 7.7835 per US dollar at 11.45am on Friday, stronger by 0.05 per cent from Thursday, when it rose 0.08 per cent. On a weekly basis, the Hong Kong dollar is still weaker by 0.05 per cent after a sharp fall of 0.27 per cent on Tuesday which at one stage took it down to 7.8008, at the weaker end of the peg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local currency has weakened this year after the US increased interest rates in December. It fell 0.55 per cent last month and hit 7.8294 on January 20, an eight-and-a-half-year low. It was only after some buy orders which traders believed to be </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> intervention that the currency moved back to the strong end of the peg at 7.80.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan traded mainly by mainlanders remained flat at 6.5690 per US dollar at 11.45am, weaker by 0.08 per cent. The currency has risen 0.09 per cent this week and has risen four weeks in a row, after a depreciation of 1.56 per cent in the first week of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the mid-price of the yuan against the euro weaker by 578 basis points to 7.3333, and for every 100 yen weaker by 441 basis points at 5.5977. The mid-price against the pound was set 161 basis points stronger at 9.5480.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pressure is lingering for more depreciation of the yuan and </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> is likely to make another attempt at devaluation after the Lunar New Year, following earlier ones in August and last month, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan fell to a three-week low of 6.6203 against the US dollar on Monday, after Japan took global investors by surprise by announcing on Friday it would cut interest rates below zero, and dropped further to 6.6423 on Wednesday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mid-January, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> lifted the offshore yuan from a five-year low of 6.7128 and since then has been sending "stable" signals. In the first two weeks of the year, the central bank had set the yuan's daily guiding mid-price weaker, but the move sparked wild expectations of yuan devaluation, accompanied by panicked capital outflow. The same thing happened after August 11, when it set the fixing 2 per cent weaker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beijing may have been testing the water. It is unlikely that China will adopt a one-off devaluation," said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist of AXA Investment Managers.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he said, the reaction to the moves in August and January showed the market tended to interpret the active devaluation of the yuan as a hard-landing signal for China. That was something Beijing could not accept and that's why it intervened, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the global markets become receptive to yuan weakness as a natural part of China's economic rebalancing, then the Chinese authorities would take the opportunity and allow a faster depreciation of the yuan," Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the chances of the yuan staying at its current level for long were slim. China's economy is slowing down, along with the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aggressive easing from Japan has weakened the yen and is likely to prompt other central banks, including the </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1">, to follow suit, putting more pressure on the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key point is that China has been subsidising its trading partners with an overvalued currency in recent years, and the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will ask why they have to continue the situation now," said Kay Van Petersen, Saxo Capital Markets' Asia macro strategist. "Devalue the yuan would correct the currency which has been artificially held high. Letting it go naturally is in line with the yuan's internationalisation agenda ... it would be an easy way out for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there were too many Communist Party members and too many vested interests sending conflicting information and signals about China's currency market in recent months, indicating the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> might not be the one to make the decision, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When everyone is finger pointing at the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, they should understand it is not the Fed," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At a meeting of central bankers at Ankara in September, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China would give the market a bigger say in deciding the value of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But since then he has not provided any explanation of the central bank's stance on the yuan, or January's government intervention in the offshore market. Leading financial figures, including </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> head Christine Lagarde and former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, have singled out China's poor communication as a source of unnecessary market turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said that even with the depreciation in recent months, the yuan was still 10 per cent overvalued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When China's high-ranking officials, including Premier Li Keqiang reiterated 'there is no basis for continuous devaluation of the yuan', they were referring to the basket constituted by the currencies of its major trading partners that the yuan is now pegged to, rather than the US dollar," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> introduced a China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) basket in mid December, and has been indicating the yuan is depegging from the US dollar in favour of a broader basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao said he expected the yuan to depreciate by 7 per cent against the US dollar by the end of this year, to just above seven to the greenback, as it gradually unwound the 10 per cent overvaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">KH Heng, a senior foreign exchange strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said he expected onshore yuan would continue to see more weakness towards 7.00 against the US dollar by the end of the year, after "near-term stability" lost support.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Persistent capital outflows were draining China's foreign reserves, he said in a report outlining factors weighing on the Chinese currency. Weakening currencies in other Asian and emerging economies were strangling China's exports. Deteriorating manufacturing growth in the domestic market had companies craving more monetary easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> warned valuations on China's A-share market would be suppressed this year as the yuan became more volatile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We find the drop in valuation in equity markets is often accompanied by the increase in currency volatilities, based on the analysis of 12 emerging markets," it said in a report released late last month. "A possible explanation might be investors demanding a premium for currency risk."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong saw its first corporate casualty of the rapid-fire yuan devaluation on Thursday as fashion retailer I.T sent out a profit warning saying it had suffered a HK$60 million currency loss that might have "a substantial negative impact" on its earnings between March and August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said in a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange that it had converted its 1.2 billion yuan of fixed deposits into Hong Kong dollars after the devaluation and had entered into several forward contracts yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday changed the way it fixes the mid-point for the yuan-US dollar pair around which the yuan is allowed to rise or fall 2 per cent. That led to the yuan's sharpest depreciation since the country abandoned its peg to the US dollar in 2005. By the end of Wednesday, the yuan had lost 3.5 per cent in the offshore market and fallen 2.8 per cent onshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I.T's expected currency loss of about HK$60 million compares to total retail sales of HK$3.6 billion in Hong Kong and HK$2.6 billion in the mainland in the last financial year to February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has 580 self-owned stores in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I.T is the first listed company in Hong Kong to report currency losses because of a weakening yuan as its first-half earnings cover the period between March and August. Most firms will announce their first-half earnings this month for the period between January and June and will book currency losses in their third-quarter or annual reports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from conversion losses, Hong Kong companies, including retailers, hotels, restaurants and banks, will face headwinds on possible further yuan weakness against the HK dollar, which is pegged to the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analyst Christiaan Tuntono said in a note: "A weaker yuan will narrow the 'discount' Chinese tourists get when purchasing merchandise in Hong Kong", while easier visa approvals from competing destinations such as South Korea, Japan and Europe, along with their sharp currency devaluation, will attract mainland shoppers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuntono added that the strong signal sent by the mainland's central bank on the upside risk of the US dollar versus the yuan would result in Chinese borrowers quickening the unwinding of their debt exposures if they have not already done so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This would be negative for the growth of Hong Kong bank loans and the outlook of their profitability."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, others argue that Hong Kong could benefit as a weaker yuan will accelerate capital outflow from the mainland, which often passes through the city, or is parked in the city's property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Beijing pushes ahead with financial reforms investors should be prepared to deal with more challenges, some economists have warned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China has been known to surprise with a quick adjustment and rapidly assimilated market reforms," said Linda Yueh, a professor at the </span><span class="s3">London Business School</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan edged ever closer to the visually significant seven yuan to one US dollar mark on Wednesday. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> reaffirmed that it expected the Chinese currency to fall to 7.20 yuan to one US dollar by the end of this year, while rival </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> expected 7 yuan would be worth one dollar at the end of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the market opened, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan's mid-point rate versus the greenback at 6.9526, the weakest level since May 2008. </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> only allows the onshore yuan to move a maximum 2 per cent from its mid-point rate in daily trade.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan then strengthened marginally to stand at 6.9450 per greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking in Hong Kong on Wednesday as she introduced HSBC Private Bank's investment outlook for this year, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> private bank head of investment strategy for Asia Cheuk Wan-fan said the bank's FX strategists forecast that the yuan's depreciation to 7.20 against the US dollar would be gradual and orderly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This depreciation trend would have a positive impact on the liquidity of the Hong Kong stock market as Chinese investors sought more assets overseas, hence money would flow south.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Capital controls in China might lead to some volatility in the short term but this does not mean that it will reverse the direction of capital market reform,” Cheuk said, noting that the Hong Kong Shenzhen stock connect had opened last year despite speculation that it could be delayed due to attempts to restrict capital outflows.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Standard Chartered Wealth Management also issued their outlook for this year on Wednesday, and also noted concerns about capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With a strong US dollar and rising yields offshore, it will be difficult for the Chinese government to loosen monetary policies significantly without risking capital outflows. This caps upside for local currency bonds,” the report noted, saying that in China they preferred equities to bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Standard Chartered Wealth Management head of investment strategy Will Leung reaffirmed the bank's forecast of seven yuan to one US dollar as he introduced the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, Standard Chartered Wealth Management predicted growth would accelerate in this year for only the second year since the financial crisis, as Russia and Brazil emerged from two years of recession and United States growth accelerated modestly.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> private bank said that investors should look to North America or Asia this year, while avoiding Europe because political uncertainty contributed to declining growth prospects.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Multinational companies, foreign private investors and international private equity investment funds will see more investment opportunities in China in the next five years, as the country plans to maintain a focus on economic development and unleash the potential for innovation growth, according to Primavera Capital Group's founder Fred Hu Zuliu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expects China to lower barriers for foreign players to invest in technology and finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the last five years, [foreign investors] were cautious on whether China would continue to open up., Hu said in an interview with South China Morning Post. "They perceived that China would adopt protectionism … They presumed that doing business in China would become more difficult" than during the era of former premier Zhu Rongji during the late 1990s, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The former Greater China chairman of Goldman Sachs believes President Xi Jinping will make an effort to open up the market during his second five-year term, which ends in 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The week-long 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), which concluded on 24 October, highlighted the goal of building a "moderately prosperous society" by 2020. Xi laid out the ambitious plan, highlighting China's economic and technological advances, and the goal of transforming the nation to the top leagues of global innovation by 2035.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xi also highlighted rebalancing to a more sustainable, greener and more equitable growth model, while further opening domestic markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be growing investment opportunities for multinational companies, for private enterprises and professional investment firms like us," Hu said. "The investment opportunities will be driven by consumer services, innovation and technology. I am very excited about the economic outlook and investment opportunities that will emerge over the next few years."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he believes some foreign investors would take a wait-and-see attitude.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the past five years, the policy and the implementation were contradictory," he said. "In the next five years, we will see something more consistent from the president, premier, ministers and mayors. China will enter a new stage of open up."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expects China will further open these sectors to foreign competition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ratings agency </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> said the government's commitment to the further opening of domestic markets and encouraging the entry of foreign investors would help Chinese banks and other companies because they are likely to improve market discipline, encourage innovation, and strengthen productivity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the opening of domestic markets could interfere with the objective of having strong state-owned enterprises that play a leading role in key sectors, </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> said in a report released last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu said Primavera will continue to focus on the new economy as a beneficiary of the policy direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will be the same as when we started the company eight years ago," said Hu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2010, Primavera is a China-based investment management firm which overseesfunds for institutions, companies and families in China and around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has investments in companies that benefit from rising consumption and urban living. These include </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">. Alibaba is the owner of South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Primavera joined a US$1.1 billion fundraising round for Koubei, Alibaba's online-to-offline commercial services platform. It also took a stake in Zhejiang Dasouche Finance Leasing Company, the largest service provider for second-hand automobile merchants in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Primavera and CITIC Private Equity are seeking to raise US$5 billion for new investments, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hu declined to comment on any specific fundraising plans, he said his company took a long term approach in its China investments , focusing on consumer driven, innovation driven, health care and finance sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu will speak at the AVCJ Private Equity &amp; Venture Forum in Hong Kong on November 14.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said private equity funds would see more business opportunities as China tightens capital outflow controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes mean that sophisticated investors have less competition when competing for assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A few years ago, a coal miner or a property developer could invest overseas," he said. "This led to a lot of buyers taking stakes that were not necessarily strategic or long term. We are now seeing this tail off and seeing smarter elements, which are also more aligned with national growth sectors. In this market, only sophisticated investors who have US dollar funds can stay in the game."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar, the fourth biggest loser among Asian currencies this year against the US dollar, strengthened for the first day in six on Thursday, as it crawls its way out of the lowest end of a trading band in more than three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency, which has been pegged at 7.8 per US dollar since October 1983, is supposed to move with the greenback. Yet, it recently traded at 7.8339 per US dollar, approaching the lower limit of the trading band.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main culprit behind the local currency's slump is the carry trade, an arbitrage whereby investors borrow low-yielding currencies to buy high-yielding currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What the weakest Hong Kong dollar in 30 years means for firms, workers and travellers[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2136018/what-weakest-hong-kong-dollar-30-years-means-firms-workers]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is a carry trade?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is an arbitrage, where traders take advantage of differences in prices, selling a low-yielding product (the Hong Kong dollar) to buy a high-yielding product (the US dollar).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In this case, the price difference is between the local borrowing cost known as the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor) and the US borrowing cost known as the Libor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/08/e520efee-2048-11e8-b079-e65f92ed111a_image_hires_155435.jpg] The 1-month Hibor has slid 50 basis points this year to 0.68 per cent, while the 1-month Libor has risen 15 basis points to 1.71 per cent. Simply put, traders are borrowing against the low Hibor, selling the Hong Kong dollar to buy the US currency for investments in high-yielding US assets. The difference between the two is 103 basis points, the widest gap since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As more traders pile on to the carry, more pressure is placed on the Hong Kong dollar, causing it to weaken further against the US currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's nearly HK$2tr fiscal reserves should be spent, to benefit the people who own them[http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2085785/hong-kongs-nearly-hk2tr-fiscal-reserves-should-be-spent]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is the Hong Kong government's stance on the carry trade?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A minor adjustment was made to the currency board arrangement, whereby a trading band of between 7.7500 and 7.8500 per US dollar was put around the Hong Kong currency, obliging the monetary authority to intervene when the local currency trades higher or lower the band limits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Howard Lee, deputy chief executive of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, said on Tuesday that while the Hong Kong dollar had reached its weakest level in more than 30 years, this valuation was “well within the design of the system.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/08/bc0deb7a-206b-11e8-b079-e65f92ed111a_image_hires_155435.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since the global financial crisis, we have seen large amounts of funds flow into Hong Kong, and now we are seeing these same funds flow out,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po was also reported this week as saying he expected some funds to exit Hong Kong, causing weakness in the currency. However, capital outflow are good for the city, helping to “normalise” Hong Kong's market rates at a more ideal pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's de facto central bank probably would not take additional steps - such as issuing extra Exchange Fund bills - to soak up the abundant liquidity to curb depreciation pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To peg or not to peg? That is the question for the Hong Kong dollar[http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2085775/peg-or-not-peg-question-hong-hong-dollar]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the stock market becomes more volatile this year, demand for Hong Kong dollar-denominated assets remain relatively supported and capital outflows are well-contained, said OCBC-Wing Hang Bank's economist Carie Li. So any further declines in the Hong Kong dollar will be very slow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system, the HKMA is mandated to sell US dollars at HK$7.85 when necessary to protect the peg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy, Asia at </span><span class="s3">Westpac Banking Corp</span><span class="s1"> said that the HKMA probably was not taking the more flexible approach of issuing extra Exchange Fund bills, preferring the harsher measure of conducting foreign exchange operations when the weak-side convertibility undertaking is triggered with the aim of shrinking the monetary base. It may think liquidity is too loose and banks rates too low, that is encouraging excessive risk taking investor behaviour, Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is backed by the HK$4 trillion (US$513.5 billion) Exchange Fund, one of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves. The fund, established as an asset war chest for defending the currency's value, also makes investments, earning a record HK$252 billion in 2017 income.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among possible winners and losers following an anticipated US rate rise, analysts say mainland Chinese property stocks could see selling pressure if the yuan depreciates further, while Chinese gold and other metal miners may rebound after the recent commodity rout if the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> takes a more cautious approach to the pace of futures rate increases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is widely expected to increase its short-term interest rates for first time in almost a decade later on Wednesday. The lift-off is likely to generate volatility in money markets and create aripple effect inglobal stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Jefferies Group</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong and mainland Chinese property stocks could see a "road split" after the rate increase, with Hong Kong developers drawing more investor interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A major reason to adjust up the portfolio weighting (of Hong Kong property stocks) will be related to HK's short-term rate outlook, as we argued HK is not going to follow the Fed to raise rates," said Venant Chiang, equity analyst for Jefferies, in a recent research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Historically, the Hong Kong dollar base rate has followed the US rate to avoid massive capital outflow in rate increase cycles, especially since the local currency is pegged to the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Chiang said current conditions may allow Hong Kong to delay the rate increase, as the city has sufficient domestic liquidity to tackle capital outflows and the improved HKD loan-to-deposit ratio offers "higher cushion and flexibility" for local banks if the US raises interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Hong Kong delays its rate increase, local developers could "utilize the extended window" to sell more properties, which will improve their earnings and balance-sheets, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, an increase in US interest rates may add to the depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan. While a weakened yuan could worsen the profits of mainland property firms, more conversion from yuan into HKD deposits will "strengthen bank liquidity in HKD". Besides, it is at the discretion of banks to decide rate changes that depend on loan demand and deposits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe this is a major top-down catalyst to attract buy flows into HK property stocks that have been oversold," Chiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank favoured benchmark index constituents, such as </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1"> and Cheung Kong Properties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other side, Jefferies said mainland Chinese property stocks could see selling pressure after a Fed rate increase, due to escalated risks related to RMB volatility and aggressive bond raising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the second half of this year, the onshore Chinese yuan has already fallen approximately 4 per cent and the offshore rate has dropped 5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further depreciation of RMB could worsen developers' income statements and balance sheets, Chiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Owing to high leverage and high proportion of debt denominated in USD/HKD, Chinese developers will recognise potential profit reduction due to foreign exchange loss in the income statement," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It may also push up the gearing ratio for developers, which is a measure of a company's financial risk calculated by dividing its net liabilities by stockholders' equity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Jefferies' estimation, a 5 per cent RMB devaluation will jeopardise major Chinese developers' net profit by 21 per cent and net asset value by 6.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Financial visibility could worsen alongside the dynamic currency market," Chiang added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meantime, as China has relaxed in the domestic bond market, companies may aggressively issue new property bonds at home for offshore debt payment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, under the current scheme, developers' intention to move money outside China may only put more devaluation pressure on the yuan, Chiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given that developers currently have a combined US$ 30 billion worth of offshore bond which will expire during 2016 to 2018, "to settle this scale of debt obligation may hurt a company's financial position as a result of RMB volatility", he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among various players in the sector, Jefferies said smaller-sized property firms could be more exposed to industry risks compared with quality players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Chinese equities that are sensitive to the Fed's tightening include gold and other metal miners, as the prospect of a Fed rate increase has hurt metal prices since earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts project a short rebound in prices for gold, copper, and other metals if the Fed takes a more dovish stance to future rate increases as expected, thus possibly spurring a rebound in the sector's stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Historically, metal prices usually fall ahead of the first rise in every rate increase cycle, reflecting market expectations, but after the rate decision is made, in line with expectations, metal prices will see a rebound for a short period," Chen Yan and Dong Yubo, stock analysts for </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1">. (CICC), said in a recent note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Metal prices have been suffering from a prolonged weakness since 2011 due in part to worries over China's economic slowdown and a glut in many metals in the world market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since earlier this year, expectations of a US interest rate increase also added to the downward pressure on metal prices, as a rate rise would strengthen the US currency, making the dollar-denominated metals more expensive for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gold prices have fallen 11 per cent since the start of June, while copper prices have tumbled 24 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Historical data from 1990s and the 2004-to-2006 period showed gold prices usually staged a mild rebound for about one month shortly after the first rise in each rate increase cycle, CICC analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Copper prices also recovered for about a week after the first rate increase in 1988, 1999 and 2004, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expected gold, copper, aluminium prices to have a "short rebound" after the anticipated December rate rise, and suggest buying opportunities for Chinese metal mining stocks, including Shanghai-listed Shandong Gold Mining and Yunan Aluminium and Hong Kong-listed Jiangxi Copper and </span><span class="s3">Zhaojin Mining</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, they also warned against volatility in the sector if the Fed appears hawkish on the path of rate increases and the US dollar strengthens more than expected.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's yuan joins an elite group of reserve currencies created by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> on Saturday in a move hailed as a milestone in the country's rise to global financial prominence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From tomorrow, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, will become the fifth member of the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s prestigious Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket of currencies, alongside the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and British pound.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say it marks the beginning of a new era for the yuan, paving the way for its wider adoption in international trade and bolstering China's status as a key player in the global financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, they also say that Beijing would need to carry out more reforms in the years ahead to push the internationalisation of the yuan, as it is now the only SDR reserve currency that cannot be fully traded. International investors still face a lot of restrictions in trading in yuan-denominated bonds and stocks.[It is] a landmark moment in the renminbi's journey towards becoming a truly international currencyPeter Wong Tung-shun, chief executive Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peter Wong Tung-shun, chief executive of the Asia-Pacific region for HSBC, described the inclusion of the yuan in the SDR basket as “a landmark moment in the renminbi's journey towards becoming a truly international currency.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SDR is an international currency reserve created by the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> in 1969 to promote trade, increase liquidity and supplement member countries' official reserves during financial crises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing first started to allow use of the yuan outside the mainland in 2003 when it let Hong Kong banks conduct certain designated business in the currency. In 2009, it started to push the currency harder, permitting international companies and businessmen to settle trade in yuan, and a year later allowing the yuan to be used in investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November last year IMF managing director Christine Lagarde declared that the yuan satisfied the two main criteria for inclusion in the basket, namely that it was “widely used” and “freely usable”. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> announced the yuan was to become its fifth reserve currency in December.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SDR inclusion now formally catapults it into the ranks of the world's most important reserve currencies, and will give greater confidence to companies and institutions around the world to settle trade in yuan and invest in yuan-denominated assets,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Going forward, we believe the Chinese authorities will continue to deliver financial and capital market reforms, gradually opening the door to more cross-border flows, and ensuring that China and the renminbi become increasingly integrated into the global financial system.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said Hong Kong, as an offshore yuan trading centre and a key financial and asset management market, would play a pivotal role in the internationalisation of the yuan in the future.China is likely to let the yuan become fully convertible only when its economy recoversMarc Chandler, Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, described the yuan's induction into the SDR basket as “an acknowledgement of the immense strides China has made since the 1970s, and especially since its entry in to the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organization</span><span class="s1"> in 2001.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> last month sold US$700 million in bonds denominated in SDR, the first such issue in more than 30 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the bigger picture, the role of the yuan as a reserve currency can only go up. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has estimated that the yuan accounts for about 1 per cent of global reserves,” Chandler said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">King International chief executive Jasper Lo believes it may need five years for the yuan to become fully convertible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said: “The mainland economy is weak and a fully convertible yuan now would lead to capital outflow. China is likely to let the yuan become fully convertible only when its economy recovers. This may need about five years time.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the eve of its including in the SDR basket, the yuan remained weak, trading at 6.6698 per US dollar, down almost 7 per cent in the past year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's first asset-based securities product has been caught in the crossfire between the securities and the banking authorities, in the latest example of a lack of policy co-ordination among the regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Ping An asset-backed security worth 2.6 billion yuan was expected to list on the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> last week before the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> put a stop to it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The product was expected to open the floodgates for several hundred billion of yuan fundraising via securitisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank's intervention triggered criticism, with the investment community calling it unnecessary since the cabinet has already given its nod to a market-driven asset-backed securities sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The products are assets or loans pooled into financial instruments that can be sold to general investors. They were at the centre of the credit bubble of the mid-2000s and the financial crisis that followed in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has been encouraging financial institutions to issue asset-backed securities since last year, hoping to create a new financing channel for companies amid a tightening of monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Bank, a unit of insurance giant </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, this month filed an application for credit-backed securities to the Shanghai exchange, which operates under the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, but did not inform the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> about it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After blocking the launch, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> insisted the suspension was in compliance with the central government's policy directive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Credit-backed securitisation is correlated to monetary policy and a stable and coordinated development of the financial market," it said. "Institutions should file ABS issuance plans to the central bank beforehand."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said the registration procedure is different from the approval process, under which issuing an asset-backed security is subject to central bank approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The CSRC could not be reached for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market observers said the power struggle among regulators is a major stumbling block to an overhaul of the mainland's finance industry, one of the primary goals of the government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2007, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said it would allow mainland residents to directly buy Hong Kong stocks under a "through train" scheme. The plan was aborted in deference to the CSRC's concerns over a massive capital outflow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past couple of years, the CSRC has found itself pitted against other powerful bodies regarding control over the private equity industry. There have also been reports of the central bank locking horns with the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> over the capital crunch in the banking system a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The regulating bodies don't appear to openly fight each other on policy issues," said a </span><span class="s3">Shenyin Wanguo Securities</span><span class="s1"> official who asked not to be identified. "But they are resistant to sharing power with other agencies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is the reason Beijing has been working on a mega financial regulatory body encompassing the banking, securities and insurance regulators to facilitate reforms. But even after a decade of planning, that idea is nowhere near getting off the ground.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan bounced back on Thursday morning as the US-China trade war showed signs of easing and the central bank set its mid price stronger than the market expected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan, which is traded by international investors outside mainland China, rose 0.8 per cent to trade at 6.8910 yuan per US dollar on Thursday mid day. That put an end to the losing streak in the previous six trading days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday, the currency once dropped 0.9 per cent to a 20-month low at 6.9454 per dollar, the weakest since January 2, 2017, when it traded at 6.9729 per US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan, traded by mainland traders, also strengthened on Thursday mid day, rising 0.5 per cent to 6.8961 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan has strengthened as a senior Chinese delegation will fly to the US later this month to negotiate about the trade war. This has given hope that the trade disputes between China and the US will be solved,” said Tommy Ong, managing director of treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commerce Vice-Minister Wang Shouwen is to lead the delegation that will meet with US Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass to discuss “economic and trade issues between China and the US”, according to a statement issued by </span><span class="s3">China's Commerce Ministry</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In addition, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has set the yuan mid price at a level stronger than the market expected on Thursday morning, which signals the central bank would not like to see the yuan continue to fall further. This also added support to the yuan,” Ong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan mid price lower by 0.1 per cent to 6.8956 yuan per dollar on Thursday than Wednesday's fix, which marks the seventh straight day it set the mid price lower. But the level is getting narrower than on Wednesday, when the central bank set the mid price weaker by 0.23 per cent from Monday. Traders can trade only up to two per cent higher or lower than the PBOC mid price during the day.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ong said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would not like to see the yuan to go further weaken beyond 6.95 level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would take action to intervene the yuan if it would go closer to 7 yuan per dollar. The yuan has gone down more than 10 per cent from its peak this year. The companies which have US dollar debts would find it hard to support. There may also capital outflow amid a weaker yuan. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would not like to see the yuan go beyond 7 yuan per dollar,” Ong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks bounced back in morning trading on Friday after two days of losses, buoyed by gains in US and mainland China shares on speculation that the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will stay put longer on interest rate rises and Beijing will further ease policies to prop up the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index added 1.43 per cent, or 394.55 points, to 27,918.27 before the lunch break, putting the benchmark well on track for a second straight week of gains. The H-share index of mainland Chinese stocks listed in the city added 1.42 per cent to 14,332.92.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.93 per cent to 4,617.02, the highest level since February 20, 2008. It is poised for the biggest weekly gain since late November, as investors bet on additional fiscal and monetary policy easing by Beijing to support the economy following weaker-than-expected manufacturing data on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Jefferies report on Friday showed that the Hong Kong share market saw capital outflows between May 14 and May 20, with asset managers pulling a net US$22 million from equities during the period. That marked the first capital outflow for a week-long period from the city following eight straight weeks of net inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">H-share valuations are hovering around just 10 times, compared with about 15 times for A shares, suggesting opportunities for more bargain hunting. The A-H Premium Index stood at 127.06 at 10am, suggesting that A-share prices are trading at a 27.06 per cent premium to their H-share peers on average.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark </span><span class="s3">S&amp;P 500</span><span class="s1"> Index hit a fresh high on Thursday after data showed that jobless claims rose more than expected last week and home resales in April fell unexpectedly. That helped fuel speculation of a later than expected rate increase in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong) </span><span class="s1">jumped 7.5 per cent to HK$32.95 after saying that its parent </span><span class="s3">Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> could inject its operations in certain Asean countries, including banking business and assets, into the Hong Kong-listed arm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> rose 1.08 per cent to HK$75.05 after a US appeals court on Thursday reversed a US$2.46 billion judgment against the banking giant in a long-running securities fraud class action stemming from a consumer finance business it bought more than a decade ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Li &amp; Fung</span><span class="s1"> lost 2.27 per cent to HK$7.32 after one of its major customers, </span><span class="s3">Wal-Mart Stores</span><span class="s1">, said it has decided to cut some of its product sourcing from the company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Chinese cement and steel companies may pick up in the second half, thanks to steady infrastructure and property investments in smaller cities, said Mandy Chan, head of China and Hong Kong equities at </span><span class="s3">HSBC Global Asset Management</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's approved new home building projects in January jumped 40 per cent year on year. As it takes time for developers to get bank loans and start construction, the demand for raw materials will soar in the second half,” Chan said, adding that property sales in second-tier cities is key to national economic recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the steel sector still faces overcapacity problems, it will enjoy an upward trend, she said. “What the market did not notice is that many private steel factories have shut down amid a plunge in steel prices since the last quarter of 2015. The demand and supply of steel has been quite balanced of late.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese property developers' sales rise in the first quarter, helped by government support[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/1933849/chinese-property-developers-sales-rise-first-quarter-helped-government]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebar futures in China have jumped 54 per cent so far this year, to 2,787 yuan a tonne on Thursday, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Futures Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cement sector is also recovering. The average price has started to rebound over the past weeks, with inventory levels coming down, especially in eastern China, Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The A-share market will be driven by economic fundamentals this year,” Chan said, given that the anticipated increase in infrastructure and property projects in the second-tier cities will support share prices of raw material providers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The contracted sales value in China's second-tier cities, such as Nanjing and Suzhou, accounted for 39 per cent of the total sales nationwide last year, while those of the four first-tier cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, only 16 per cent, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I don't think there is a bubble in second-tier cities,” Chan said. The affordability ratio of China's second-tier cities is around 47.8 per cent, which is quite healthy, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's public-private-partnership (PPP) programmes in regional provinces have also increased this year, which will boost demand for raw material sectors, said Judy Chang, chief investment officer at CIFM Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What will happen to China's cement production, 30 times that of the US, and steel production, five times that of the EU, if demand turns sour?[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/1924670/what-will-happen-chinas-cement-production-30-times-us-and-steel-production]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Regional governments were hesitant to spend last year under the pressure of the anti-graft campaign, but this year they've accelerated PPP programmes,” Chang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The demand from PPP programmes could be reflected in the June-September period, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">'s Chan added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite market volatility, asset managers believe Chinese equities are turning attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The CSI 300 index, which tracks blue chips in Shanghai and Shenzhen, is trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 12.4, compared with the 10-year average of 16.2.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The delay of IPO registration reform would help avoid a capital outflow into new listings and maintain liquidity in the secondary stock market, CIFM said in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More cuts of the required reserve ratio could be seen this year, although the central bank may be careful about further interest rate cuts, it said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> (CSRC), China's top securities regulator, on Tuesday warned mainland Chinese investors to stay away from new internet platforms and mobile apps geared towards overseas equity trading, citing operating risks in the unauthorised platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A number of mainland internet companies emerged recently. They cooperate with overseas brokerage companies, providing channels and services for domestic investors to trade the overseas equity market...While [these activities] lack legal protection,” the CSRC said in a statement that appeared under the risk alert section on its official website on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other analysts said these companies were operating in a legal grey zone, raising concerns whether they would be allowed to continue operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore investment by Chinese individuals are tightly controlled under the current rules. Traditionally, investors can only trade overseas equities through a programme called “QDII” which offers quotas to select institutions. Each Chinese citizen faces an annual exchange swap cap of US$50,000.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent months, a number of mobile apps have appeared which help investors to trade offshore shares using US or Hong Kong dollars held in their domestic accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiger Securities, Futu Network, and Jimu Stock, were listed as examples by the CSRC. But the regulator did not clarify if these platforms were illegal, nor did it indicated they would be forced to close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to the Securities Law, without the approval of the securities regulator under the State Council, none of the individual or institution can run brokerage business. Also, overseas brokerage companies should get regulator's approval to run brokerage business inside China,” the CSRC statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source close to the regulator said the case exposed “a blind spot” in the current rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies like Tiger Securities are actually connected to brokerages run outside China. There are a lack of rules to regulate this business,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A customer service rep with Tiger Securities said their platform was linked to Interactive Brokers, a brokerage firm registered with the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">. But she would not clarify if they have gotten permission from the CSRC to obtain clients in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">None of the three institutions listed by the CSRC has brokerage licenses in China. They are registered with local industrial and commercial authorities as “tech companies”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tiger Securities, backed by Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, said turnover on its platform had surpassed US$100 million in July, the first month its mobile app was put into operation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current size of the market is still small, compared to the A-share market which saw average daily turnover of several hundred billion. However, it has already aroused the attention of regulators as it may release huge potential demand from Chinese people to invest overseas...it will further weigh on the capital outflow pressure,” said a source close to Tiger Securities, who asked to remain anonymous.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“By using the internet platforms to trade the overseas market, investors will have their accounts and money offshore. Once a disputes happen, the interests of investors will lack effective protection,” the CSRC said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to current laws and rules, citizens in the Chinese mainland can invest in the overseas equities markets by buying into QDII funds, or by using the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect programme,” the CSRC said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regulator urged investors to use legal channels “to avoid being cheated”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves have dropped below the psychological level of US$3 trillion for the first time since February 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves dropped by US$12.3 billion last month, a smaller fall compared with December, but still larger than expected in light of China's strict capital account measures adopted at the end of last year and a weaker US dollar, which can help the valuation of non-dollar denominations in the portfolio.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign banks could find it tough selling offshore yuan products based on their newly obtained investment quotas, underscoring the difficulty in differentiating products in a crowded market and attracting customers amid a continuing outflow of capital from the region, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global lenders, including </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and Hang Seng Bank, are set to issue RQFII (renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor) products in Hong Kong after becoming the first non-mainland institutions to win the licences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> said last week that it had obtained a quota of 800 million yuan (HK$1 billion) under the scheme, while Hang Seng had earlier gained 1 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> will launch a fund to invest in the onshore bond market, while Hang Seng will issue an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the mainland share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market watchers say their products could find it difficult beating the already sluggish performance of some products issued by mainland competitors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A sluggish macroeconomic environment due to concerns about the potential tapering of quantitative easing in the United States is also putting lenders under pressure to attract capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors are increasingly savvy and mature - RQFII is still new and people need time to understand," said Sally Wong Chi-ming, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association. "Investors no longer just focus on the upside, they also ask about the downside and risks. The A-share and interbank bond markets do have risks that we are not familiar with."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been a massive capital flight from RQFII ETF and fixed-income funds this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As much as 12 billion yuan flowed out of ETFs during the first nine months of this year, excluding net inflows to these funds on their first day of trading, according to Morningstar data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for fixed-income funds, 11 of 18 products targeting retail investors saw redemptions during the first half, reports show.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five out of 14 bond funds targeting institutional investors also saw redemptions during the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides capital outflow concerns, foreign banks may have lost out at the starting line in the ETF race since they are given smaller quotas than their mainland rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, five of the eight ETFs issued by mainland companies are bigger than Hang Seng's 1 billion yuan product.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the ETF world, a bigger size usually means the funds will be faster in getting inflows to their products and thus are able to save a lot of costs," said Jackie Choy, an ETF strategist for Morningstar, who oversees the company's ETF research in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choy said small ETFs could find it hard to attract institutional investors since many fund houses imposed limits on investing in small investment products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many money managers might not be able to invest in a product if the assets under management did not reach a particular level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The RQFII scheme, part of the mainland's efforts to globalise its currency, allows offshore companies to invest yuan deposits in the country's equity and bond markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Official data shows 42 firms had received quotas by last month - 39 of them with mainland background.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With more players joining the fray, competition will intensify," Wong said. "But the pie is growing rapidly and what is important is for fund managers to show they are best-in-class."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland companies will be encouraged to work with Hong Kong firms to pursue outbound investments as part of Beijing's go-global push.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deputy Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng told a media briefing yesterday that Beijing would act as a matchmaker, helping more Hong Kong and mainland firms form consortiums to invest overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are trying to set up a platform to facilitate the co-operation of Hong Kong and mainland companies so that they can go abroad together," Gao said, adding that the ministry has been organising talks between business delegations, hoping to consolidate tie-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing began encouraging state-owned companies to go abroad in 2007 when it attempted to direct a capital outflow to combat stubborn inflation. Capitalising on the country's rising economic might, Beijing is now determined to encourage Chinese firms to conduct merger and acquisition deals abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deputy commerce minister's statement signalled that Beijing is keen for Hong Kong companies to play a supporting role in the campaign. Hong Kong companies have the edge on their mainland peers in, for example, fashion design and service industries. Beijing officials want mainland companies to draw on their Hong Kong peers' experience in managing hotels, conference venues and office buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They have expertise in construction project supervision and consulting, which is much needed by mainland companies making overseas investments," Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies have grappled with regulatory hurdles in the past year to complete overseas acquisitions because of foreign political opposition against Beijing and its state-controlled corporate giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of the companies now use either a foreign proxy or hire well-known advisers to help seal the deals. In May, Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">Bright Food (Group) </span><span class="s1">announced it would buy 60 per cent of British cereal maker Weetabix Food for £1.2 billion (HK$14.48 billion), including debt. The deal was advised by the global investment banking arm of Rothschild Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dealogic data showed that the total outbound acquisitions by mainland companies were valued at US$61 billion in 2011, up 20 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ministry also plans to step up efforts to support the development of small- and medium-sized firms. Gao said the ministry was confident that year-on-year growth of exports and imports would top 10 per cent this year despite a global slowdown.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's monetary authority raised the city's base lending rate for the second time this year, in lockstep with an overnight move by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the ever-rising cost of money becomes more apparent, the rate hike has been made to maintain stability in Hong Kong's local currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's base lending rate was raised by 25 basis points to 2.25, according to a statement by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, effective immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US Fed raised its interest rate by the same amount to a range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2150679/us-federal-reserve-raises-benchmark-interest-rate-sees-possible], the seventh time it has done so since December 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eight of 15 Fed officials expect at least four rate increases will be needed this year to stave off inflation in the US economy, which implies two more increments in the remainder of this year. Those moves must be matched by the Hong Kong authority to maintain the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US currency, which means a higher cost of money in the city that will spill over eventually to higher mortgage rates for the property sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hongkongers will feel the squeeze as mortgage rates gain momentum[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/2150659/hongkongers-will-feel-squeeze-mortgage-rates-gain-momentum]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some bankers believe HKMA may use its moral suasion to urge banks to increase their prime rate, which covers most mortgages, credit cards and personal loans in Hong Kong. The increase would help defend the local currency but would be bad news for borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing the media on Thursday morning, HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said it is only a matter of time before individual lenders increase their saving rates and prime rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A normalisation of interest rates may bring volatility to the market but it will help the property market to achieve more healthy development,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he was unsurprised that the Fed is now forecasting four further rate increases this year, instead of the three previously predicted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US economic growth is solid, the labour market is tight and inflation is looming. It is not a surprise that the US expects to raise the interest rate more. Hong Kong will follow any of these rate rises under the peg,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's commercial banks have until now not increased their prime rates, which remain at between 5 per cent and 5.25 per cent. If banks raise their prime rates today, that will be the first move by commercial banks in 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They may increase the prime rate in the next few months but not immediately, as there is plenty of liquidity in the financial system,” said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific in Hong Kong. “The many mega initial public offerings have attracted money into Hong Kong, which has cut down the need to raise the lending rate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The past six rate increases have led Hong Kong mortgage payments linked to the city's interbank offered rates, or Hibor, to rise. One-month and three-month Hibor has risen to the highest point in 10 years at over 1.5 per cent, while major banks have to offer high interest rate as high as 2.3 per cent to compete for large-sum deposits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rise of Hibor may also be due to the fact that banks have been preparing to fund the many mega IPOs [in Hong Kong] in the near term,” said Chan. “After that, the Hibor may drop again and the interest rate gap with the US may widen once again. When that happens, it may lead to capital outflow happening again,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no need to worry, as this would be normal under the system of the peg. When the banks increase their prime and saving rates, the outflow will stop.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Explainer: What Hong Kong's interest rate increase means for Hibor, prime and mortgages</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is the base lending rate?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the interest that banks pay on money they borrow from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">. Individuals or companies do not borrow money at this rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How do higher base lending rates affect mortgage rates in Hong Kong?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It doesn't have a direct effect as almost all mortgage rates are either linked to Hibor (the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate), or linked to prime rates, which are set by banks. The city's biggest lenders such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> have a prime rate of 5 per cent. </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> set their prime rate of 5.25 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How are Hong Kong's mortgage rates priced?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two options are available:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">1) Hibor plus a percentage (the best advertised rates are normally 1.3 per cent), or</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2) Prime minus a percentage (the best advertised rates are around 2.85 per cent, or 3.1 per cent, depending on which prime rate a bank uses).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What's the advantage or pitfall of each option?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's banks have not changed their prime rates since the 2008 global financial crisis, but Hibor changes every day, as it reflects the interest rates banks charge other banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the base rate rises, and banks have to pay more to borrow from the HKMA, it's fair to expect banks to charge each other higher rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The past six rate increases have led Hong Kong mortgage payments linked to the city's interbank offered rates, or Hibor, to rise. One-month and three-month Hibor has now risen to the highest point in 10 years at over 1.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hibor rises, do mortgage payments get more expensive?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, up to a point. However, most borrowers' Hibor-linked mortgages include a clause which says that if their repayments are greater than they would be on a prime mortgage, they automatically switch to a prime-based payment scheme. We reached that point last year, so repayments have not risen that much.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hibor (about 1.5 per cent) + 1.24 per cent = 2.74 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prime - 3 per cent = 2.15 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When will the banks raise their prime rates?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts believe they will do so in the next few months, but not necessarily straight away as liquidity is high. Hong Kong's string of huge IPOs has kept money pouring in to the financial system and this has reduced the need to raise borrowing costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When lenders do eventually raise their prime rates, it will be the first move by commercial banks in 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What are the historical prime rate movements?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The current prime rate in Hong Kong of 5 per cent is the lowest on record and hasn't changed for 10 years. The record highest was 19.61 in 1981.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The last time major banks increased their prime rate was in March 2006, when they raised it by 25 basis points to 8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the wake of the global financial crisis came a rate-cutting cycle. The last time the banks changed their rate was in November 2008, when it was lowered by 25 basis points to the current level of between 5 per cent and 5.25 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two and half years ago when China's Premier Li Keqiang was visiting Kenya, he told journalists that the excessive amount of foreign exchange reserves "has become a very big burden" for Beijing because they distorted the country's domestic monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At that time, China had witnessed an almost unstoppable rise in the level of its foreign exchange reserves for more than a decade; it seemed that a big stockpile of foreign exchange would continue to increase to haunt Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Few anticipated that China's reserves would hit an all-time peak the month after Li's comments - and even fewer would have expected that Beijing needed to worry about a fall in those same reserves so soon.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said an important consideration behind the Chinese government's decision to impose more vigilant checks on outbound investment deals was to safeguard Beijing's foreign exchange reserves after the world's largest stockpile of foreign exchange fell by US$837 billion from its US$3.99 trillion peak at the end of June 2014. China's foreign exchange reserves at the end of October stood at US$3.12 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As China's foreign exchange reserves fall, there's a visible shift in policy to defend the reserves," said Wang Youxin, a researcher at Bank of China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government doesn't want to see the reserves shrinking too quickly, and it's a big change from the days when the reserves were seen as more than enough."As China's foreign exchange reserves fall, there's a visible shift in policy to defend the reserves. The government doesn't want to see the reserves shrinking too quicklyWang Youxin, a researcher at Bank of China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In terms of an absolute amount, China's foreign exchange reserves are still the world's largest - far larger than those of Japan and Saudi Arabia - but it is the rate at which they are falling that is ringing alarm bells.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yan Se, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said China's reserves faced real pressure of shrinking further in future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said China's foreign exchange reserves faced "a double whammy" because of the long-term trend of outbound investment and short-term speculation to buy dollars, which meant China's "capital account deficit" was likely to widen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China became a net capital exporter for the first time in 2015 as outbound direct investment rose for the 13th year in a row to US$145.67 billion - outstripping foreign direct investment of US$135.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The debate about the role of foreign reserves has been going on for years, if not decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the early days of the People's Republic of China, when hard currency was rare, the ruling Communist Party had, for the most part, regarded the US dollar as a strategic state asset and kept it only in hands of state agencies and organs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When Deng Xiaoping led a China delegation attending the United Nations assembly in 1974, he used up his pocket money of about US$20 to buy baguettes to take back to Beijing to share with his comrades, according to an article, published in 2004 in the Chinese Communist Party news section on the People's Daily website.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s further cemented the view that China needed a deep pool of reserves to cope with possible capital flight and external shocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A framework of capital control rules were set in place to encourage inflows - and discourage outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's reserves started to take off after its entry into the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1"> in 2001 as a huge trade surplus and an influx of investment funds quickly led the reserves to balloon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2006, China overtook Japan to become the country with the biggest foreign exchange reserves. That year, China's reserves exceeded US$1 trillion and that total almost quadrupled over the following eight years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> had to keep printing yuan to buy incoming dollars, leading to excessive liquidity in the domestic market, which in turn caused asset bubbles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the process, Beijing began to change its tactics. ?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It started to encourage individuals to hold dollars. In 2007 it launched the US$50,000 quota for all residents, making it easier for Chinese consumers to travel and shop abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has also stepped up its efforts to diversify its reserves away from US Treasuries into other forms of assets. To this end, China created its own sovereign wealth fund and also eased state company deals in overseas markets with foreign currencies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two facts about the central bank's latest easing measure fit fairly neatly. They are the amount of this week's liquidity boost, up to 600 billion yuan (HK$755 billion), and fourth-quarter capital outflow of about 570 billion. Net inflows over the past decade have added to domestic money supply. The sharp reversal helped prompt the central bank to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately it is all about jobs and stability. The move reflects mainland leaders' worries about maintaining economic growth needed to meet their job creation target.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The leadership is striving to strike a balance between stimulus that would risk a return to an unsustainable growth rate and the danger of slowdown in the economy developing a momentum of its own. Economists had been expecting further easing following an interest-rate cut in November, to supplement targeted easing measures to lower borrowing costs in selected sectors of the economy. This expectation was heightened by the release this week of the January manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, which indicated contraction in the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The knee-jerk market reaction to a policy easing to kick off 2015 is to wonder just how badly the mainland economy is doing. But things cannot always be taken at face value at this time because of tightness in the financial system ahead of the Lunar New Year, which generates a huge demand for cash. The cut in the reserve ratio relieves some of that pressure at a time of reduced liquidity. And a lower growth rate in percentage terms can be looked at in terms of an economy three times bigger than a decade ago, which means 7.4 per cent last year is arguably better than the 10.1 per cent chalked up in 2004.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank is also responding to moves by counterparts elsewhere, such as the </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1">'s massive quantitative easing programme, which adds to pressure on China. Indeed, global economic uncertainty is stoking the pressure, prompting Beijing to allow the yuan to depreciate a little to maintain the competitiveness of exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This underlines the urgency of pressing on with structural reforms that rebalance the economy with activities less reliant on credit. It was therefore good to hear an assurance from </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> research chief Lu Lei that the cut in the bank reserve requirement ratio does not mark a return to strong stimulus or represent a policy shift.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore Chinese corporations are cutting exposure to US dollar-denominated debt and ramping up trade settled in yuan as a hedge against the mainland's depreciating currency, according to a survey by </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The findings from the survey of 173 company treasurers and senior executives around the world came just a day after mainland China's foreign exchange reserves hit a 33-month low and highlighted the strong expectations among businesses that the yuan will continue to depreciate well into 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 80 per cent of onshore exporters said they expected yuan trade settlements to increase over the next six months, compared with only 33 per cent of exporters outside the mainland. The figures show a growing need on both sides of the settlements to protect against further slides in the value of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese exporters would look to keep trade in the mainland currency - also known as the renminbi (RMB) - “probably because they also want to shift their [foreign exchange] exposure to their offshore suppliers and buyers”, said Carmen Ling, head of RMB solutions at </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regionally, yuan-denominated trade settlements have grown rapidly this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Swift said last week that the yuan has become the second-most-used currency for payments between Japan and China, including Hong Kong.China's authorities may have beefed-up their interventions in onshore and offshore markets to defend the RMB exchange rate in the run-up to the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s decisionXia Le, </span><span class="s3">BBVA</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Payments denominated in yuan between Japan and China hit 7 per cent of the total, up from 3 per cent two years ago. Most trade between the two countries is still denominated in yen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government allowed the yuan to depreciate rapidly over a three-day period in August. The expectation that the yuan will continue to depreciate next year has driven demand for US dollars and a strong outflow of capital from mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> reported that foreign reserves had fallen to a 33-month low, a sign that the government has intervened in the currency market to prop up the value of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves held by the central bank fell to US$3.44 trillion at the end of last month, down US$87.2 billion, according to </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was also a sign that firms with offshore debt are worrying about a higher cost of repayment as the yuan continues to slide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese firms anticipating increasingly greater exchange-rate risk since the RMB was devalued in August, as well as a heavier interest-rate burden from USD-denominated debts, are in a rush to repay their foreign debts, which has also contributed to the outflow of capital in November,” Mizuho Securities Asia's China economist Shen Jianguang said in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Research firm </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1"> has estimated that capital outflow from mainland China may have surpassed US$100 billion in November, which would be a record.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 30 per cent of the foreign reserves are denominated in currencies other US dollars, causing a significant depreciation in the value of the assets held by the central bank as the US dollar appreciates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 22 per cent of the reserves are denominated in euros, a currency that fell 4.4 per cent against the US dollar last month. That alone would have caused the foreign exchange reserves to fall by US$34 billion last month, </span><span class="s3">BBVA</span><span class="s1"> calculated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> said late last month that it would add the yuan to its basket of global currencies, called Special Drawing Rights. Some experts say the central bank may have used the foreign reserves to stabilise the currency in the days before that landmark decision was announced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's authorities may have beefed-up their interventions in onshore and offshore markets to defend the RMB exchange rate in the run-up to the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s decision to include the currency into the SDR,” Xia Le, chief Asia economist at BBVA in Hong Kong, said in a note. “These interventions require tapping into China's foreign reserves.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau casino operator Galaxy Entertainment Group, which posted a 36 per cent jump in earnings on Thursday, says it supports the Philippines government's move to temporarily close Boracay for environmental reasons and will seek further clarification after announcing plans for a US$500 million resort on the island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We support the Philippine Government's decision to temporarily close Boracay and their restoration initiative for the island,” it said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse on Thursday. “We continue to work with our local partner to seek further clarification.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, one of the six listed casino operators in the tiny enclave of Macau, announced in March initial plans to develop a casino-cum-resort with up to 60 tables on the popular holiday island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fierce competition has prompted a number of operators in Macau, the only place where its legal to gamble in China, to seek new growth engines, including finding new destinations for casinos in a bid to draw high rollers in this region, many of whom are affluent middle class Chinese gamblers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the Philippines gaming regulator said at the end of April that the resort has been put on hold, and that Galaxy would need to convince President Rodrigo Duterte of its “advantages”, according to Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is there more to President Rodrigo Duterte's Boracay closure and drug war than meets the eye?[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2144058/there-more-dutertes-boracay-closure-and-drug-war-meets-eye]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Boracay is officially shut for six months for a clean up since April 26 after Duterte called the place a “cesspool”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to the Boracay resort, </span><span class="s3">Galaxy Entertainment</span><span class="s1"> said it was actively pursuing the development of an integrated resort in Japan and has been making progress with its plans for a resort in Hengqin, close to the Chinese city of Zhuhai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which operates Galaxy Macau, Broadway Macau and StarWorld Macau, accounts for about 21.2 per cent of the general gaming revenue generated in Macau, according to Daiwa Capital Markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company on Thursday also reported a 36 per cent increase in Ebitda to HK$4.3 billion (US$547.7 million) for the first three months this year, while revenue rose 32 per cent to HK$18.5 billion on the back of resurgent demand from high rollers and mass gamblers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The earnings growth comes close on the heels of a better-than-expected Macau gaming revenues for April. The 28 per cent growth beat analysts conservative estimates of about 20 per cent in April.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sophie Lin, a Hong Kong-based analyst at the ratings agency S&amp;P Global, said that although industry observers have been worried about the possible effects of China's policies including caps on capital outflow and ongoing anti corruption campaign on Macau's high rollers, the city's gaming business has not been influenced too much by these policies this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We might revise our estimation for Macau's gaming revenue if this kind of momentum continues into the next few months,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">British insurance giant </span><span class="s3">Prudential</span><span class="s1">'s operating profit from its Asian operations jumped 14 per cent in the first half, higher than the 9 per cent increase from its overall operations, as its strategy to focus on the region is paying off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong and London listed company said that overall operating profit amounted to £2.41 billion (US$3.1 billion) for the first half, while profit generated from Asia reached £1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The insurer, which has 15 million life customers worldwide, has turned its focus to Asia, where a large portion of the population is still not covered by any kind of insurance plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is especially a bright spot among the Asian countries, as in recent years mainland Chinese residents have been flocking to Hong Kong to buy insurance plans as a way to transfer assets overseas amid Beijing's tightening grip on capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Prudential</span><span class="s1"> is a major insurance provider in the city, and operates through two locally incorporated companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March, the company announced that it would separate its UK and European operations - M&amp;G Prudential - from its international business in a bid to better focus on fast growing markets including Asia and the US. M&amp;G Prudential is to be listed on the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and headed by its current chief executive John Foley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While no specific timeline for the demerger has been given, the company said on Wednesday the plan was progressing well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are taking the steps needed for the demerger of M&amp;G Prudential from the group … and we are making good progress,” said Mike Wells, CEO of Prudential.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wells also shrugged off fears of a full-scale China-US trade war and the upcoming Brexit on its operations, saying the company's clients are spread globally and that the two issues should not bother the insurer too much.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These political tensions might create a different path for the buyers, they take a little longer to make decisions, they worry a little more, but it doesn't change the economic and structural need,” Wells said during an earnings call on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[The trade war] is unfortunate, certainly not an outcome you want to see in a market place, but it's not affecting us.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company increased its interim dividend by 8 per cent to 15.67 pence per share. Shares of the company were up 3.2 per cent in London trading on Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When Wu Xiaohui, </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance Group</span><span class="s1">'s billionaire founder, bought Manhattan's landmark Waldorf Astoria in 2015, he said he planned to hold onto the hotel gem for 100 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only two years later, however, the Chinese auto-insurance-salesman-turned-business-tycoon was arrested. Anbang was officially taken over by the Chinese government in February, and Wu pleaded guilty in March to fraud and embezzlement, facing a potential life sentence. The company's US assets - including the famed hotel- are back on the block.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang is among a list of Chinese conglomerates that went from buying up billions of dollars of hotel and office buildings in the US to collectively selling them off in just a couple of years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> to </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, Beijing's tighter grip on capital outflow has brought down once high-flying deal makers and prompted Chinese companies to reverse course and to exit their briskly obtained overseas assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Few could have predicted Chinese buyers' fast entry” a few years ago, said Richard Hightower, a real estate analyst at the New York-based investment bank Evercore ISI. “And few could have predicted their quick exit either.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the height of the buying spree, Chinese companies invested a total of US$37 billion in US real estate from 2014 to 2016, according to </span><span class="s3">Real Capital Analytics</span><span class="s1">, a New York-based commercial property data provider.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of the assets are now in the market to be sold as the Chinese government reins in the risks imposed on the companies as well as the financial system as a whole from the debt-fuelled acquisitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sharp reversal has sparked hopes among US investors that a potential fire sale of these assets could create buying opportunities, offering rare dislocations in asset value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hopes were especially high for Wall Street's investment powerhouse </span><span class="s3">Blackstone Group</span><span class="s1">, which had sold a number of big-name hotels to Anbang in 2015 and 2016, to buy back the assets. The group's chairman, Stephen Schwarzman, said in February on Bloomberg TV that “if they are selling, we are taking a look”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But while talks are continuing about buying back San Francisco's Westin St. Francis in San Francisco and JW Marriott Essex House in New York - two hotels Blackstone sold to Anbang through </span><span class="s3">Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts</span><span class="s1"> in 2016 - Waldorf Astoria is a much harder deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Waldorf Astoria, part of which is being converted into condominiums, is hard to value because it's no longer entirely a hotel, analysts said. That, combined with financial factors like the lack of cash flow during the construction, makes it a difficult property to assess for real estate buyers specialising in hotels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street investors acknowledge that despite the pressure on Chinese companies to sell, many have managed to turn a profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at our sales to Chinese buyers - particularly European logistics, the Hilton stake and Japanese residential - the vast majority have been highly successful investments,” a spokeswoman at Blackstone told theSouth China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HNA's unloading of its stake in Hilton Group stands to generate US$2 billion in profit. The Chinese conglomerate, which bought the stake for US$6.5 billion in 2016, continues to own a quarter in </span><span class="s3">Hilton</span><span class="s1">, valued at about US$6.9 billion. That remaining stake is also up for sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HNA, one of the most acquisitive Chinese companies, borrowed heavily to fuel its speculative investments. Its interest expenses rose to a record of US$5.1 billion in 2017, topping all Asian companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, the once-acquisitive Chinese company has sold US$13 billion of assets in recent months and is continuing to sell more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang is also under pressure to restructure and will start looking for private capital. With close to US$10 billion in capital supplied by Chinese authorities, it isn't in as much as a financial bind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time of its takeover in February, the government said it would control the business for at least a year, providing leeway to wait for a good offer to show up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That wiggle room also helps Anbang as the US hotel sector, which saw a dip due to hurricanes and political turmoil in 2017, sees an uptick this year, according to a report by the </span><span class="s3">National Association of Realtors</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the most recent quarter, we've seen transactions picking back up,” said Richard Barkham, global chief economist at CBRE, a commercial real estate services company based in Los Angeles, California.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a huge amount of capital targeting real estate. Buyers are coming back with a changed mindset willing to accept current pricing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The amount of private capital targeting North America real estate investment rose to a record high at US$176 billion as of Tuesday, according to estimates by the data provider Preqin.For [some firms], losing some money isn't good, but they'd rather get out of the area that's seen as problematic by BeijingGeoffrey Sant, cross-border lawyer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another potential upside to waiting is the pending changes in the US tax code, which reduces the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This change helps property sellers because valuations are likely to go up “as lower taxes have a positive effect on cash flows, resulting in greater returns for sellers,” according to a McKinsey report on tax reform's impact on asset sales in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And waiting for a higher valuation is crucial as most of the Chinese-owned properties were acquired at the peak of the market around 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, “some firms are forced to sell,” said Geoffrey Sant, a lawyer at </span><span class="s3">Dorsey &amp; Whitney</span><span class="s1"> who represents Chinese clients in cross-border transactions. “For them, losing some money isn't good, but they'd rather get out of the area that's seen as problematic by Beijing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some private equity firms have already taken advantage of buying smaller and lesser-known assets back from the Chinese. In March, the New York-based real estate investor Northwood Investor bought HNA's 1180 Sixth Avenue office for US$305 million. The price dropped from US$320 million as cash-strapped HNA was in a bind to service its debt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Storm looms as Xi tries to clean up financial industry[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2088995/first-guns-then-knives-now-xi-goes-after-money-bags-chinas]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Northwood is also said to be considering purchase of another property, 245 Park Avenue, which HNA bought just last year for US$2.2 billion from the private equity house </span><span class="s3">Brookfield Asset Management</span><span class="s1">. The estimated valuation is lower than what the Chinese company paid, according to real estate analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spokesmen for Northwood and Brookfield did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US private equity and investment firms have long been the dominant investors in commercial real estate properties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of the third quarter of 2017, as much as 56 per cent of the US$3.97 trillion equity-based investment in commercial real estate was owned by private equity firms, continuing a trend a year earlier, according to a report published by Deloitte, the </span><span class="s3">National Association of Realtors</span><span class="s1"> and the valuation consultancy Situs RERC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street investors such as Blackstone and Brookfield have profited from Chinese investors' buying binge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2016 Blackstone sold the two hotels it owned through </span><span class="s3">Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts</span><span class="s1"> for US$6.5 billion, about US$450 million more than it had paid for them just a few months earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also sold 747 Fifth Avenue, a midtown office building steps away from the Trump Tower, to Anbang to be its US headquarters a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waldorf Astoria had brought the single highest price tag in US hotel deals at US$1.95 billion. Blackstone, which had owned Hilton before selling it to HNA, made back the US$6.4 billion it had invested in the hotel operator with that sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, in a frothy real estate market, only a few firms are able to write the checks big enough to buy Waldorf Astoria. Blackstone, which has more than US$450 billion in assets under management and US$120 billion in real estate investments alone, definitely fits the bill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But buy back the iconic hotel when the nature of the property has significantly changed? That's a different story.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Chinese were buying [the real estate] for non-economic reasons and are selling for non-economic reasons, which creates difficulty for US investors, who traditionally have a financial return objective in mind,” said Evercore's Hightower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I don't think Blackstone will do a deal just for the sake of owning Waldorf Astoria again.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's trade surplus this year is likely to exceed that of last year, making it tougher for the government to balance trade and avoid friction with trading partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said yesterday that a higher trade surplus was probable as imports were expected to weaken more than exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trade surplus last year totalled US$155.14 billion. In the first half of this year, the surplus jumped 56.4 per cent from a year ago to US$68.92 billion. Last month alone, exports surpassed imports by a three-year high of US$31.72 billion as domestic demand softened while global prices of energy and raw materials fell.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho Securities, said: "The rising trade surplus is expected to lead to yuan appreciation by up to 3 per cent in 2012." The yuan has weakened against the US dollar by about 1.3 per cent so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ministry spokesman Shen said the mainland's goal of achieving trade balance and reducing surplus remained unchanged. Analysts see it as a reaffirmation of Beijing's stance to avoid criticism that the world's biggest exporter supports local firms by undervaluing its currency artificially while granting foreign companies limited access to the Chinese market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The World Trade Organisation said on Monday that Beijing had violated trade rules through regulations that helped </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> dominate the lucrative electronic payment market. The ministry said yesterday that Beijing had reservations over the ruling, which largely backed allegations filed by the United States accusing China of discrimination against foreign bank cards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign investors are continuing to pour money into China, but complaints about fair market treatment, policy transparency and the legal environment have risen in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, foreign direct investment into the mainland fell 6.9 per cent year on year to US$12 billion, with 2,444 foreign firms setting up shop - down 16.3 per cent from a year ago. In the first six months of this year, FDI dropped 3 per cent year on year to US$59.1 billion. The Commerce Ministry attributed it to government curbs on real estate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Stripping out the property sector, FDI was down only 0.1 per cent year on year to US$46.8 billion in the first half," spokesman Shen said, adding that full-year FDI would show steady growth from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chang Jian, an economist at </span><span class="s3">Barclays Capital</span><span class="s1">, said capital outflow from the mainland was likely to have continued in the second quarter, going by the central bank's foreign-exchange purchases position that showed a small net increase of US$1.8 billion during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ministry says outbound direct investment surged 48.2 per cent year on year to US$35.42 billion in the first half, with a third of the funds used in mergers and acquisitions. Investments going to Hong Kong soared 58.9 per cent, funds heading to Asean countries rose 34.3 per cent, while those to the United States went up 28.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> released a report titled The Faces of Chinese Investment in the United States, aiming to facilitate investment from Chinese firms. The chamber's president and chief executive Thomas Donohue said: "The US market is highly competitive and open to the Chinese investment. There are challenges, but they can be managed."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's push to root out financial irregularities and curb excessive borrowing led to a big slump in shadow banking activities last month, a development that could translate into more pain for the country's bond and stock investors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao Hongyan, an economist at Huatai Financial Holdings in Hong Kong, said Beijing's monetary authority would not go extreme lengths with its tightening policy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank put 459 billion yuan into the banking system via the medium-term lending facility (MLF) on Friday, and the amount of credit will be more than enough for banks to cover some MLF loans that matured last week and some set to mature next week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move helped the stock market index gain 0.72 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the central bank skipped daily open market operations on Friday, marking the fifth day in two weeks that it declined to inject short-term liquidity into the interbank market via its usual route.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Less-developed countries along the new Silk Road stand be among the big winners of investment as China revives ancient land and maritime trade routes, according to estimates by a top bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> forecasts that China's massive inflow of investment over the next five years as part of Beijing's “Belt and Road Initiative” could amount to as much as US$502 billion, or equivalent to 4 per cent of the total gross domestic product of the 62 countries along the routes in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest recipients of the investment dollars were expected to be India, Russia, Indonesia, Iran and Egypt, the bank said in a report released earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initiative, unveiled in ­September 2013 by President Xi Jinping, aims to connect China by a network of overland corridors and sea routes to the rest of Asia, Africa and beyond, linking the dozens of countries through infrastructure and financial and trade ties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The economies along the routes account for about 63 per cent of the world's population and 29 per cent of global GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> estimates that China's overseas investment in the initiative over the next five years will range between US$313 billion to US$502 billion, depending on how much investment the countries need and how much China is willing to put in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where the rubber meets the ‘Belt and Road' - German ambassador answers the big questions [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2093707/german-ambassador-answers-belt-and-road-questions]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">India stands to be the biggest gainer overall, according to the report, with China putting in ­between US$84 billion and US$126 billion. Russia is next with US$53 billion to US$80 billion; ­Indonesia third on US$35 billion-US$52 billion; Iran fourth attracting US$17 billion-US$26 billion; and Egypt fifth with US$13 billion to US$20 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also says China could invest between US$52 billion and US$79 billion in 13 African countries. “Africa is rich in resources, and an important destination for Chinese investment over the past decade,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to an </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> estimate, the “Belt and Road Initiative” will generate roughly 300 billion yuan to 500 billion yuan in railway investment, financing more than 15,000km in high-speed rail links along the route.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> report said the initiative could become even more promising as a more “isolationist” administration in the United States created windows of opportunity. “With the new US administration pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it is unavoidably sending a message to the world that </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> policy is turning more ‘isolationist',” the report said. At the same, China was striving for greater global influence, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investment could also help make up for any capital outflows in the region, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the dollar strengthens, especially as the US moves along the path of rate normalisation, emerging market countries also have to face the risks of capital outflow,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eric lp, group managing director of </span><span class="s3">Hutchison Ports</span><span class="s1">, said regional economic growth was gaining traction, as opposed to global growth under the new US new administration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, exports to China from countries in the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1"> recovered faster and better in recent months than those of other trading partners. In March 2017, the growth of Asean's exports to China was higher than those to the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">, the US, Japan and South Korea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> also said China's actual investment in the belt and road countries might fall short of expectations, given the drop in its foreign exchange ­reserves over the last few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves stood at US$3.030 trillion in April, well ­below the peak of US$4 trillion ­recorded in June 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is likely to shift its monetary policy from deleveraging to one “buttressing” growth, after its ongoing trade war with the United States cooled economic growth in the second quarter, according to a research report released by DBS on Tuesday. Deleveraging was adopted to curb shadow banking and excessive borrowing by local governments and companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> is likely to shift its stance from deleveraging to buttressing growth. Local companies have been facing serious liquidity issues amid deleveraging and the forthcoming tax season. The amount of medium-term lending facilities due in the next 12 months will rise to 4.2 trillion yuan,” Samuel Tse, an economist at the bank, said in the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Indeed, the market has started to price in the changing signals of its monetary policy stance. The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate has dropped by 95 basis points within three weeks. In response, the yuan has depreciated from 6.27 in mid-April to 6.69 in mid-July. Expect the yuan to remain under pressure,” said Tse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report follows yuan deposit rate cuts at </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong's biggest bank, on Friday, and at local mid-tier lender </span><span class="s3">Wing Lung Bank</span><span class="s1">, which cut the rate several times over the past two weeks. Other major banks, such as </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1">, Standard Chartered Bank and ICBC Asia, have not changed their rates, but currency traders believe they will follow the trend and lower their yuan time deposit rates, because the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> is likely to continue with a low interest rate and monetary easing regime amid the ongoing trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/17/4407637e-89aa-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_image_hires_184609.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> cut rates across all tenures, with the one-month yuan time deposit rate down to 2 per cent from 2.7 per cent, the three-month rate down to 2.9 per cent from 3.35 per cent, the six-month rate down to 3.1 per cent from 3.4 per cent, and the 12-month rate down to 3.4 per cent from 3.45 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/17/44728c80-89aa-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_image_hires_184609.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have adjusted the yuan time deposit rates in response to the recent movement of yuan interbank rates in Hong Kong,” said a bank spokeswoman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wing Lung Bank</span><span class="s1"> cut its one-month yuan deposit rate to 2.15 per cent from 2.55 per cent, the three- month yuan deposit rate to 2.85 per cent from 3.45 per cent, and its 12-month deposit rate to 3.15 per cent from 3.7 per cent.We have adjusted the yuan time deposit rates in response to the recent movement of yuan interbank rates in Hong KongHSBC spokeswoman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> cut the reserve requirement ratio last week to unlock billions in cash for the market. This has lowered the onshore yuan interest rate in Shanghai, and also the interest rate for the offshore yuan in Hong Kong,” said Tommy Ong, managing director of treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-month offshore yuan interbank interest rate now stands at below 3 per cent, down from 4.8 per cent on June 19, said Ong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides the ongoing trade war with the US, economic growth on the mainland is not good. This has led the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to adopt a policy of monetary easing. The central bank may be pressured to further cut interest rates or the reserve requirement ratio this year. This will continue to bring the mainland and Hong Kong yuan interest rates to a lower level,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ong said the lower yuan deposit rate was also related to the demand for the currency, which has decreased after the end of the half-year settlement period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo Cho-yan, chief investment strategist at Hong Kong-based Eddid Securities and Futures, said China's monetary easing policy will continue to offer cheap money and will led to lower interest rates, and this means the exchange rate of the yuan will continue to remain at the recent low level of 6.7333 per US dollar - or it may go further down to 6.90 this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, I do not believe the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will let the yuan go down any further, below the 6.90 level, as this may lead to a serious capital outflow problem. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will intervene in the market if the yuan falls to such a low,” said Lo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan fell by 5.4 per cent over a period of 14 days, its longest losing streak, after the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> opted not to follow the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> and increase interest rates on June 14. It has also been affected by the trade war between Washington and Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency touched a low of 6.7333 against the US dollar on July 3, prompting the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to issue a statement saying it would defend the yuan if needed. The currency bounced back before falling once again last week after US President Donald Trump said the US was considering tariffs on Chinese goods worth US$200 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Eddid Securities and Futures' Lo said the yuan was at a level where investors could consider buying in to the currency as a long-term investment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was only a few years ago that Beijing was turning up its nose at the so-called barbarians who were banging on China's door and begging to be allowed to climb on the nation's economic boom and yuan appreciation bandwagon. The situation couldn't be more different now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent months, the Chinese government has spared no effort to convince outside investors to put money into China's onshore equity and bond markets. It created a new channel enabling investors to buy into the US$9 trillion bond market, and it is widening existing portals to increase the inflow of money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-way Bond Connect programme was launched earlier this week, allowing investors in Hong Kong to buy bonds in China's interbank, without any quota limits. A day later, China said the quota for another investment scheme was increased to 500 billion yuan (US$73.6 billion) - almost as big as the total yuan deposit in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's change in attitude comes as the country is evolving from a global growth darling into a risky emerging market grappling with an economic slowdown, mountains of unpaid debt and persistent capital outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's heavy-handed intervention in the marketplace, including its draconian control over capital outflows, opaque tweaking of the yuan exchange rate regime and intolerance of any volatility beyond its control, has deterred many investors from rushing into China assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors may hesitate when considering such factors in their decision-making and therefore hold their investment temporarily," said Iris Pang, a Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The awkwardly crafted acronym RQFII, which seems to have much in common with Donald Trump's infamous typo "Cofveve", stands for "renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor" and is in itself a design stemmed from China's capital account control and mistrust of "foreign players".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Bond Connect sees US$1b worth of trading on first day[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2100984/mainland-hong-kong-bond-connect-debuts-3-billion-yuan-trade]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China entered the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1"> in 2001, it became apparent that China must also open up its capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But instead of opening the market to all possible investors, China copied a temporary arrangement from Taiwan called QFII, imposing strict qualification requirements and letting only the world's biggest investment houses buy into Chinese securities under a given quota from Beijing. By the end of June, China had authorised 283 "qualified foreign investors" to buy into China securities with a combined quota of $92.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The renminbi QFII system started in 2011 when Beijing decided that holders of yuan outside the mainland should be permitted to buy onshore securities. The scheme was initially launched in Hong Kong under a quota of 20 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China's decision to raise the quota to 500 billion yuan from the current 270 billion yuan is understandable, widening the door doesn't have a lot of real meaning if not many people are trying to get in, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist of Macquarie Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There was large capital flight last year...and the central bank tends to lure them back with RQFII," Hu said. "Investors are reluctant to increase yuan assets at the moment given their expectation of [yuan] depreciation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, the deliberate design of the Bond Connect's one-way opening, allowing only Hong Kong investors to put their money into the mainland instead of the other way around, raised suspicion over whether China was trying to integrate its market with the world or taking a purposeful approach to luring funds to balance its outflow pressure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China widens the inward channel, its outward channel, the qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) programme, has been shelved without any new quota being granted in the past one and a half years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Opening up should cover both inflows and outflows," said Zhao Hongyan, an economist at Huatai Financing Holdings in Hong Kong. "Outflow restrictions, together with exchange risk, may dampen investors... and run against the long-term goals of yuan internationalisation and capital market opening up," she added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior Hong Kong officials have their work cut out for them these days, especially with the pressing task of defending the city's judicial independence after three student leaders were jailed[http://www.scmp.com/video/hong-kong/2107258/pro-democracy-student-leaders-jailed-storming-government-buildings] last week by the Court of Appeal over an illegal protest, reversing an earlier and more lenient ruling by a lower court.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sentencing has been criticised as political persecution[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107529/former-hong-kong-bar-association-chief-says-jailing-three] by opposition pan-democratic politicians as well as some local and Western media outlets[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2107463/foreign-politicians-call-release-hong-kongs-political]. Both the government and the city's legal community have found such criticism unwarranted and unacceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's No 2 official,[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107476/hong-kongs-chief-secretary-defends-decision-jail-young] Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, and others such as barrister Ronny Tong Ka-wah, who is a government adviser in the Executive Council, have rejected the “biased” reports by local and foreign media. They warned that politicising the decisions of judges is dangerous and damaging to Hong Kong's reputation for judicial integrity and independence, which has long been treasured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As this critical debate rages on, another group of officials looking after the city's economic and financial affairs have something else on their plate that is also crucial - to monitor the impact on Hong Kong, positive or negative, of the latest directive from the State Council[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2107392/overseas-hotels-and-soccer-clubs-crosshairs-china-ramps] further regulating the country's outbound investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interestingly, bad news for Chinese companies in their “go global” ambitions can sometimes mean good news for Hong Kong. One such aspect of the directive is to strongly restrict overseas property investments[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2080433/how-chinas-overseas-property-dream-turned-nightmare].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still fresh on the minds of Hongkongers is the trend of “land king” sites[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/1969408/land-kings-developers-rake-moolah-property-market-continues] in the city being snapped up by mainland companies which seem unperturbed by daunting prices. Their almost cavalier approach not only shocked veteran local developers, the flood of mainland capital was also regarded as a major culprit responsible for skyrocketing property prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The impact of the latest round of restrictions from Beijing, however, will not just be confined to the property market if you look at the timing and the authorities involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firstly, the directive was jointly issued by four major departments: the central government's top economic supervisor, the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1">, followed by the Ministry of Commerce, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, and the Foreign Ministry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secondly, it was announced just after the critical Beidaihe meeting[http://www.scmp.com/topics/beidaihe-meeting], which conveyed a more than clear message that, after thorough discussions in the summer resort, the top leadership had to come up with the decision to further curb capital outflow to ensure China's economy would remain on a healthy track.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economic stability will be a key issue to be tackled in the coming 19th Party Congress, besides personnel reshuffles[http://www.scmp.com/chinas-leadership-reshuffle-2017].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Back in Hong Kong, while officials at the government's Tamar headquarters are on full alert and making assessments, initial analysis could be twofold.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the upside, mainland companies, state-owned or private, are encouraged to invest in projects under the “Belt and Road Initiative” - Beijing's global trade strategy - which will continue benefiting Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Restrictions on investments in overseas property, entertainment, sports clubs and more may provide the city's business sector with alternative opportunities. But it's not without possible downsides as the directive now bans mainland companies from setting up overseas equity funds or investment vehicles without any concrete project, to name but just one aspect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong enjoys free flow of capital under the “one country, two systems” policy, as long as it is all lawful, and the city has always been one of the favourite markets for mainland investors. But it's also under this principle that Hong Kong bears the responsibility to safeguard national security, which includes financial security.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is a challenging time for Hong Kong, politically and financially.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Villa lost to Fulham in the play-off final last month and Xia suggested last week that changes were coming in response to that failure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal to take Villa over cost him around £60 million (US$80 million) and he has invested around £150 million (US$201 million) since, but restrictions on capital outflow make it tough for Xia to move money from China. There is no suggestion he is in financial trouble but Chinese restrictions are only one aspect of Villa's mounting problems.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment in Hong Kong financial technology ( fintech [http://www.scmp.com/topics/fintech]) firms more than doubled last year compared to 2016, as government support and their wider acceptance made companies in the sector more attractive to investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid what has been a global surge in interest, Hong Kong-based fintech investment jumped to US$545.7 million in 2017 from US$215.5 million in 2016 and US$107.5 million in 2015, according to an </span><span class="s3">Accenture</span><span class="s1"> analysis of data from CB Insights, a global venture-finance data and analytics firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, global investment in fintech companies reached an all time high of US$27.4 billion, a rise of 18 per cent year on year, though investment in mainland Chinese fintechs bucked the trend, declining by 72 per cent, year on year, to US$2.8 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest fundraising in Hong Kong last year was by WeLab, a peer to peer lender, which raised US$220 million in November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Musheer Ahmed, interim general manager of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, said two developments in the past two years had made Hong Kong's burgeoning fintech community more attractive to investors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks went from being sceptical about fintech, to realising it can be beneficial to themMusheer Ahmed, FinTech Association of Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Banks went from being sceptical about fintech, to realising it can be beneficial to them. Following on from this, they moved from reviewing proofs of concept to actual implementation and adoption of fintech solutions, meaning start-ups now have a steadier revenue stream, making them more attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Secondly, the Hong Kong government and regulators now have a more active agenda to push for innovation across sectors, as highlighted in Wednesday's budget speech, particularly in fintech.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Chan, Hong Kong's financial secretary said in his 2018 budget [http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2135011/money-money-money-hong-kongs-finance-chief-paul-chan] he would allocate HK$500 million (US$63.9 million) to the development of financial services over the next five years, including fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While their investment in Hong Kong last year was dwarfed by that into other markets, such as the US ($11.3 billion), India (US$2.4 billion) and mainland China, Hong Kong received greater fundraising than both Singapore - sometimes seen as its rival in fintech - and Australia, and across a longer time frame.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2010, Hong Kong fintechs have raised US$940 million, compared with US$387 million raised by Singapore-based start-ups and US$714 million for those in Australia, according to </span><span class="s3">Accenture</span><span class="s1">'s analysis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While investment into Chinese fintechs declined, year on year, Adrian Seto, Accenture's senior director, innovation &amp; fintech, Asia-Pacific, said this was not a true reflection of a deteriorating environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You can't just look at the overall value, which did go down, without taking into consideration that the number of deals actually almost tripled,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There were 146 fintech deals in China last year, compared with 54 in 2016 which were worth US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You're talking about a more active ecosystem, which is actually better. As an investor, you're de-risking by spreading your money into different deals, the quintessential ‘not putting all your eggs into one basket'.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seto added 2016 was a poor benchmark, as some unusually large deals took place, including the multibillion-dollar financing rounds from </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> and wealth management platform Lufax.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, a shift is taking place in fintech on the mainland, as the industry is responding to government attempts to reduce financial risks, the study showed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> intervened in the interbank market for a second time this week on Wednesday, pumping in 110 billion yuan through open market operations to steady interbank rates that have been shooting up as investors pull out of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> confirmed after the market close that it injected 110 billion yuan to 14 financial institutions for a period of 6 months at a rate of 3.35 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This followed an injection on Tuesday when it added 120 billion yuan in repurchase agreements to the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The back-to-back cash injections came a week after the central bank allowed the yuan to devalue by more than 3 per cent over a three-day period, sparking concerns over capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Central bank data for July confirmed that foreign exchange purchases have increased. Net outflow in foreign currencies amounted to 912.9 billion yuan in the year to July, according to the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Much more undocumented cash is expected to have flown over the border in carry trade. Critical data tracking money flows for August will not show up until September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As liquidity tightens, the Shanghai interbank offered rate, a market from which banks borrow from each other, has spiked.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overnight Shanghai interbank offered rate, or Shibor, shot up 1,380 basis points to 1.667 per cent last week. Since August 11, one-week Shibor has jumped to 2.546 per cent, from 2.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, where investors are not subject to strict capital controls, the spread between the interbank rate for offshore yuan, or CNH Hibor, and Shibor has widened to 70 per cent. CNH Hibor hit 4.34 per cent yesterday, its highest point since February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's the first of a number of steps to ensure onshore liquidity," said Albert Leung, a rates strategist at Nomura, referring to the first injection on Tuesday. "</span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is supporting liquidity - in line with policy to stabilise growth and lower funding cost."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index on Wednesday plunged below the 3,700-point mark before the news was announced. However, the index closed up by 1.23 per cent after the announcement. Cement, property and steel suppliers were among the stocks that benefited most on the news.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the massive cash injections are a sign the economy has continued to weaken. In a microblog account, the central bank said it made the injection in order to "maintain sufficient liquidity in the banking system".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> bought back 384.5 billion in medium lending term facilities last month but released 250 billion, according to financial data provider Wind. It has also cut down its issue of bonds to make room for one trillion yuan of local government bonds that are due to arrive in the market under the central government's mandated debt swap programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cash injections are also a part of what some economists have dubbed a new stimulus package aimed at boosting economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> has said it expects China's gross domestic product growth to fall to 6.8 per cent this year and has urged the government not to deploy large-scale stimulus due to the associated credit risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the same day the central bank allowed the yuan to devalue last week, PBOC chief economist Ma Jun said he expected growth to hit the 7 per cent target.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent stability in the yuan exchange rate has been "completely decided by market factors" as the central bank has basically ended its day-to-day intervention in the foreign exchange market, a deputy governor at the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, who is also the head of the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, told journalists on the sidelines of the opening ceremony of the Communist Party's 19th party congress in Beijing that the yuan would have a more secure foundation after the leadership reshuffle meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the 19th party congress, the yuan will have better foundation to be more stable," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan's comments came hours after Washington said China had not unfairly manipulated its currency to give it an unfair trade advantage, a charge regularly levelled by US President Donald Trump during his election campaign.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Treasury Department</span><span class="s1"> study backed China's interventions to shore up the yuan in a foreign currency report released on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China's recent intervention in foreign exchange markets, tightened capital controls and increased discretion over setting the daily fixing rate of [the yuan] have likely prevented a disorderly currency depreciation that would have had negative consequences for the United States, China and the global economy," it said in the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the department said it remained "concerned by the lack of progress made in reducing the bilateral trade surplus with the United States".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan exchange rate has been a flashpoint between the US and China, but tensions over the issue have eased after Beijing promised not to devalue the currency to gain an unfair advantage with its overseas trade competitors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has engineered a significant appreciation of the yuan against the dollar in the first half of this year through curbs on outbound remittances and payments and the use of a complex mechanism to decide the daily yuan price, a move that offers the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> greater control over the value of the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China's capital outflow pressure ebbed with a rise in its foreign exchange reserves for eight consecutive months, the central bank has become more relaxed about defending the yuan compared to a year ago when funds were fleeing the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">President Xi Jinping said in his 3½-hour speech at the opening of the party congress on Wednesday that China would continue the liberalisation of the exchange rate and interest rate regimes, but did not elaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yi Gang, a deputy central bank governor who is attending the congress, told reporters the yuan exchange rate regime - a managed floating exchange rate system - worked well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think the current mechanism is good. Based on this, some fluctuation of the yuan is normal," Yi said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's retiring central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, said in an interview with the Chinese magazine Caijing published last week that China must let market forces decide the yuan exchange rate and lift all capital account control measures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A growing number of Chinese property investors are opting to “redeploy” their capital in the US instead of taking it back to China, as they become more sophisticated in choosing investments, according to a lawyer who advises on such deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are increasingly ploughing the profits from earlier investments back into other projects on American soil, partly because they have developed a better understanding of the US market and partly because tighter capital controls back home are putting them off repatriating the money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Projects that started four or five years ago when the [capital outflow] restrictions were looser,” are now being sold, said Eric Landau, chair of global real estate practice at law firm Paul Hastings. “Investors are keeping that money in the US and so redeploying capital that is already here,” he said, noting that this largely shielded their capital from the tougher curbs recently announced by Beijing because it doesn't affect the country's foreign currency reserve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[In the past] the money would be returned with a profit to the Chinese investor, who would then take the money back to China and invest it in China. [Now] rather than coming back to China, it is remaining in the US and being deployed for another project.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Landau said this pointed to the fact Chinese investors are becoming more savvy in the US market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They are getting better at understanding both the deals they want to be in and the risks involved.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This trend comes on the back of a slump in China's outbound merger and acquisition activity over the past year. Chinese companies recorded US$95.9 billion in outbound M&amp;A deals during the first three quarters of 2017, a 35 per cent slump from the same period last year, according to a report by Mergermarket released on Monday.[Chinese investors] are getting better at understanding both the deals they want to be in and the risks involvedEric Landau, Paul Hastings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Late last year Beijing announced a raft of measures to tighten controls on money moving out of the country in an attempt to crack down on capital flight driven by a slowing economy and falling exchange rate. The government specifically sought to target what it called “irrational” acquisitions of assets, and singled out real estate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This led one private equity firm, A Capital, to warn of an impending “ice age” for outbound investment. The most high-profile victim of this has been the </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, whose offer to buy the American entertainment company </span><span class="s3">Dick Clark Productions</span><span class="s1"> collapsed earlier this year because of problems getting currency out of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts have also pointed to closer scrutiny of Chinese investments by the </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> as a factor in the slowdown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But according to Phillip Feder, a partner at Paul Hastings in Los Angeles, demand for large development in gateway cities will continue for deals involving apartments, office buildings and condominiums.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We've done some significant transactions involving Chinese investors betting in a big way on those sorts of deals and succeeding - even with the Trump administration - in getting approval for those transactions,” he said, pointing to Los Angeles as an example. “I see that trend continuing.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to cut the reserve requirement ratio for lenders, the first cut since last October, will only add fuel to the property fire in first-tier cities but probably won't help much in destocking in smaller cities, say analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The housing market does not need further stimulus, they said, predicting that city governments in Shenzhen and Shanghai could introduce fresh measures to regulate the red hot market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That is a bold move by </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> given the frenzied housing market in tier-1 cities and concerns of RMB deprecation and capital outflow. The RRR cut is beneficial for the housing market across the board but the effect may be felt sooner in tier-1 cities than in lower-tier cities," said Alan Jin, property analyst at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the central bank announced an unexpected 0.5 percentage point cut in the ratio. The decision could provide an additional 700 billion yuan (HK$830 billion) for banks to lend out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The housing market really needs no further stimulus as some of the problems [like inventory in lower-tier cities] could be better solved over time," said Jin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen and Shanghai saw home prices in January soar 52 per cent and 17.5 per cent year on year, respectively, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Jin believes these two cities could introduce property cooling measures in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the release of liquidity, both developers and home buyers can borrow money more easily. That would boost demand and push home prices up, especially in first-tier cities where demand is already strong," said Gong Min, a senior research manager with Shanghai Centaline Property Consultants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is very likely the first-tier cities will soon take tightening measures to curb the soaring prices," she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen saw new home prices rise 508.5 per cent between 2006 and 2015, with an annual growth rate of 20.4 per cent, according to a home price index jointly issued last week by </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1"> and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a research firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai ranked second in terms of growth over the 10-year period, with prices up 384.6 per cent, for an annual rate of 17.6 per cent. Beijing followed with a 380 per cent rise over 10 years and annual growth of 17.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Du Jinsong, head of Asia property research at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, said the RRR cut will not help much in destocking in smaller cities as oversupply is severe and some pent-up demand has already been released by stimulus policies introduced last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Past record shows that the easing policies turn out to have a larger effect on bigger cities rather than smaller cities, and that trend won't change this time," Du said. /p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's central bank will not be drawn into allowing rapid appreciation in the exchange rate of the yuan in order to stem the capital outflows that occurred in the final quarter of last year, according to sources familiar with the bank's thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> believes there is no need to move towards allowing the yuan exchange rate to rise in order to revive capital inflows, the sources say, because there are already signs that inflows turned positive last month after a "temporary" exodus of capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since the outflow is considered to be a short-term factor, more related to Europe, the Chinese government sees no need in particular to let the yuan rise fast to attract money back," said one source. "In fact, they see that money is already coming back these days."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland recorded capital outflows for three consecutive months in the last quarter of 2011 and its foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, fell about US$21 billion to US$3.18 trillion, according to the central bank's official data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would blame the outflows on the fast appreciation of the US dollar after last August, due to the European debt crisis," said Liu Ligang, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Perceptions in the final quarter of last year that the yuan might depreciate also caused some speculative "hot money" outflows, Liu added. But, he said, the market now believed capital inflows into the mainland would continue as the world's major central banks continued to engage in quantitative easing activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Capital has flowed back to Asia as a whole and data is likely to show that it flowed back to China too in January," said Joy Yang, chief economist for Greater China at Mirae Asset Securities in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is mostly because the recent growth indicators suggest a soft-landing scenario in Asia and China, and confidence in Asia's growth has picked up."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Late last year, some foreign investors pulled their money out of the mainland to buy gold and US dollars, which they considered safer investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some Western banks also recalled investments to help deal with the debt crisis in Europe and there was also strong selling pressure in Hong Kong's offshore yuan market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Manfred Schmoelz, head of transaction services origination for </span><span class="s3">Royal Bank of Scotland</span><span class="s1"> in the Asia-Pacific region, said the capital outflow from yuan holdings was a short-term phenomenon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There were business reasons behind it and I don't see any panic reason for it," said Schmoelz, who added that most of the bank's clients remained confident with regard to the outlook for the mainland's currency and economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources who had recently exchanged views with mainland central bankers noted Beijing felt "so far, so good" about the exchange rate of the yuan at around its current level of 6.3 yuan per US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank also considers that its current monetary policy settings are "not so tight" and significant easing of policy is unlikely, according to the sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first two weeks of March the mainland's top leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, will gather with lawmakers in Beijing for a political summit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some investors are looking for signs from the summit that Beijing will loosen monetary policy and ease controls over the property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But if you are expecting a policy U-turn or big easing in economic and monetary policy from the meetings to be held next month, you will be very disappointed," said one of the sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been some speculation in the market that Beijing may widen its daily trading band on the yuan to allow it to appreciate faster, partly in response to the rising political pressure from the United States. The mainland is the second-largest US trading partner.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's ever-stricter policies on capital outflow are boosting lending business in Hong Kong, according to the head of Bank of China Hong Kong (</span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yue Yi, the bank's chief executive, said at the annual general meeting on Wednesday that the lending sector of </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">'s business has already increased by about 10 per cent this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He put this down to the mainland's clampdown on capital outflows. As investors struggle to move money out of China, they are turning to banks in Hong Kong for financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The growth in the lending sector is very strong this year. The mainland has been tightening its policies on foreign exchange in order to stabilise the exchange rate and interest rate,” said Yue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Yue, </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> handles about 15,000 yuan transactions every day, totalling some 0.8 trillion yuan, and the bank now nets about 10 per cent of its profit from services involving the Chinese currency.We believe that the shrinkage of offshore yuan's liquidity pool has bottomed. It is starting to bounce backYue Yi, Bank of China Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yue added that as the yuan continues to appreciate, investors are gaining confidence in the currency, which is in turn spurring demand for offshore yuan loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe that the shrinkage of offshore yuan's liquidity pool has bottomed. It is starting to bounce back,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said China's belt and road trade initiative is presenting </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> with plenty of opportunity to expand its services related to offshore yuan, especially in southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> has been acquiring assets in southeast Asian countries from its parent company Bank of China. The acquisitions of businesses in Thailand and Malaysia have already been completed and purchases of assets in Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam are also well underway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yue said </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> is now transforming itself from a local Hong Kong bank into a regional bank, which manages business across southeast Asia and beyond.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> has already invested about HK$57.8 billion in southeast Asia, he said. While business in those countries contributed less than 10 per cent of total revenue last year, that number is expected to jump to 20 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> soared to an all-time high on Monday, surging 6.2 per cent to HK$36.80. The rally came after </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> reiterated its overweight rating for the stock and raised its target price by 21 per cent to HK$46.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bank of China, the parent company of </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">, China's fourth-largest bank by assets, reported in March that its net profit for 2016 rose 2.58 per cent year on year, reaching 184.1 billion yuan (US$26.7 billion), which exceeded an average estimate of 167 billion yuan by analysts polled by Bloomberg.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">'s measures came as the [yuan] climbed to a 19-year high against the US dollar amid strong growth in the use of yuan for worldwide trade and investment. It is now the 13th-most used currency for international payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, April 26</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why should a company outside of China want to accept payment in yuan for goods exported to China? Where can it find yuan to pay for imports from China?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Things are different for the US dollar. It is used everywhere to settle trade accounts. If you accept payment in US dollars you can immediately put that money to work without having to convert it into your domestic currency, and if you want to pay in US dollars you can easily raise the money anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar is so prevalent in trade that China itself reports its trade figures in US dollars and only publishes their yuan equivalents as an afterthought. This is entirely appropriate. Ask a mainland exporter to quote you a price and he will do so in US dollars. He thinks in dollars, he breathes in dollars. Why turn to yuan for something that the dollar already does superbly?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Short answer: Because Beijing envies Washington's ability to ignore balance-of-payments worries. At US$3.4 trillion, China holds 22 times as much in foreign reserves as the United States and it bothers the mandarins in Beijing that it is nonetheless they who are beset with constant headaches about capital flows and exchange rates. If the yuan was king it wouldn't happen (or so they think).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shorter answer: Because in Beijing this is taken as a point of national pride. China will soon be the biggest, richest country. Everyone says so and how can you be No 1 if the flag you wave abroad, that red banknote with Mao Zedong's picture on it, is still only No13? When Britain was tops, the pound wasn't No13. It's just not fitting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leave Beijing thought aside, however. We want to explore the mindset of the foreigner on whom "the strong growth in the use of yuan for worldwide trade" is based. It's simple. He doesn't use the yuan for trade. He uses it for speculation. When he accepts payment in yuan for goods exported to China he holds on to it or puts in one of those dim sum bonds. It's delicious stuff that way because he makes a profit on the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, that other kind of foreigner who buys rather than sells things to China uses the yuan no more than he ever did to pay for his imports. He doesn't have any yuan. The receipts of US consumer goods retailers are all in US dollars. Try to pay for plastic rubbish with redbacks in a big box store in Texas if you don't believe me - ("What are dem things? You figger we're playing Monopoly or somethin'?").</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus the upwards push on the yuan right now is a very one-sided push and it all comes from people who are being paid to push and who will let the yuan drop with a crash the moment they think that their pay may stop coming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I can see why Beijing is happy to play along with them at the moment. It needs their money. Last year saw a US$96 billion net capital outflow, the biggest such amount in history. But what I cannot fathom is why anyone at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> should think this fleeting game is something on which to build the longer-term strength of our own economy. That's a puzzle indeed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's industrial output and investment grew less than expected in the first two months of this year, an indication sluggish demand that might fuel expectations of more easing measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Industrial output grew by 6.8 per cent year on year in January and February, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists had expected industrial output growth of 7.7 per cent. They tend to read the first two months??data together in a bid to eliminate any distortions caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pace was also slower than the 8.6 per cent growth in the first two months of last year. In 2014 as a whole, industrial output expanded 8.3 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Lunar New Year holiday began on January 30 last year and February 18 this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fixed-asset investment (FAI) rose 13.9 per cent in the first two months of the year, falling short of expectations of 15.0 per cent growth and even shorter of the 17.9 per cent growth in the same period last year. In 2014 as a whole, FAI grew 15.7 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Retail sales climbed 10.7 per cent year on year in January and February, after rising 11.8 per cent a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government is targeting gross domestic product growth of about 7 per cent this year, after GDP growth eased to a 24-year low of 7.4 per cent last year.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The economic recovery in the United States and eased lending standards at US banks are expected to lure capital from the mainland and spur borrowing by Chinese firms abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's slowdown in economic growth and tightening up on loan quality are expected to discourage international investors and speculators from committing funds there and force some Chinese firms to borrow overseas, economists and bankers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will see continued net capital outflows in the third quarter from the mainland as well as from other emerging countries," Ding Zhijie, a finance professor at the University of International Business and Economics, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, it would not be disastrous for China, given its foreign reserves."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the second quarter, the net capital outflow from the mainland was an estimated 47 billion yuan (HK$59.5 billion) amid expectations of economic deceleration and a lacklustre property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflows were also encouraged by the US economy's expected further rebound from the 1.7 per cent growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter, Ding said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US banks are easing their lending standards for commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and other credits, according to the Federal Reserve's survey, released last week, of senior loan officers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, the mainland government was unlikely to beef up lending substantially this year, the professor said, as banks face increasing bad loans and indebtedness in local governments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> chief economist Paul Tang Sai-on said the recent recovery, albeit a slow one, in the US economy fuelled higher demand for credit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some capital may flow back to the US, because, relatively, there are more investment opportunities over there," he said. "Because of China's structural problem in its economy, which has grown too fast in the past few years, it has to keep tight credit."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A corporate lending director with a Hong Kong bank said there were signs of capital outflows to the US from Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"US lending has loosened a bit, feeding the demand for trade finance," he said. "Trade finance is a much sought-after area."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite relatively loose credit in the US, he expected mainland firms to continue to seek loans in Hong Kong rather than the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shandong Asia Pacific SSYMB Pulp &amp; Paper, a joint venture by a subsidiary of Singapore-based RGE and Shandong companies, recently signed an agreement to borrow 6.3 billion yuan from its Hong Kong-based holding company for up to 66 months, Shandong's Rizhao branch of the central bank said this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The holding company obtained financing from banks in Hong Kong, which could save about 400 million yuan in extra interest payments the subsidiary would have to make if it borrowed from banks on the mainland, the central bank said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China will probably continue to prevent the yuan exchange rate from falling further as a prerequisite for a trade deal with the United States before the March 1 deadline, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, the nation's central bank, has successfully intervened in the market to keep the yuan stronger than seven to the US dollar and is expected to continue to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Trump administration has frequently warned China against using its exchange rate for competitive devaluation purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Between late-March and October, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> let the currency slump 12 per cent toward the key seven yuan to the dollar level amid the outbreak of the trade war with the United States, a strengthening of the US dollar and higher US interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the yuan's decline came to an abrupt halt and rebounded for the first time in eight months in November before trading in a range between 6.83 and 6.92 per US dollar in December, which analysts interpreted as a shift in </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> policy to focus on stabilising the currency as part of the deal for the US holding off on further tariff increases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through capital controls and the daily yuan reference rate, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> appears to be preventing the yuan from breaking the seven to the dollar level, which could adversely affect US-China trade talks and business confidence as well as a significantly increase capital outflow pressure, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the yuan was changing hands at 6.9111 against the US dollar, down 0.07 per cent from the previous session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier in the day, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the midpoint of the yuan daily trading range at 6.9006 per dollar, down 0.26 per cent. Traders are allowed to trade the yuan within 2 per cent on either side of the midpoint.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should defend yuan at 7 to the US dollar, adviser says[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2178146/china-should-defend-yuan-7-us-dollar-central-bank-adviser-says]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Under a scenario of the ongoing US-China trade dispute and given the controversy over the exchange rate, there is not much room for yuan depreciation,” said Ding Wenjie, economist at CMB International Securities, predicting that the yuan would remain in a range between 6.70 and seven per dollar next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned several times recently that the US would keep its eye on the yuan exchange rate to make sure that China does not use a weaker currency for economic advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In any case, the technical factors supporting the yuan are improving: pressure from a higher US dollar is being scaled back because of expectations of slower US and global growth next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are now “increasingly” predicting the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will raise interest rates only once or twice next year, down from previous forecasts of about two to three times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Becky Liu, head China macro Strategy at </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">, said that her bank thinks the dollar's value has peaked for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This should take some pressure off the Chinese yuan as the dollar softens,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's central bank won't be rushed into monetary changes[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2177969/chinas-central-bank-keen-avoid-irrational-panic-despite]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the yuan remains fragile as China's economy faces headwinds in the coming year with deflationary pressure picking up and economic activity weakening, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, the consumer price index fell 0.3 per cent from October while the producer price index dropped 0.2 per cent - the first month-on-month fall in seven months - due to steep falls in the price of crude oil and coal, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> said that net capital outflows picked up modestly to US$25 billion in November, with the domestic bond market showing a small outflow of around US$5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US has a long list of complaints about Chinese trade practices, including a lack of intellectual property protection, forced technology transfer and widespread industrial subsidies, which may result in more heated disputes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But China's ability to defend the yuan remains strong, allowing the central bank to offset the downward pressure on the exchange rate as the trade talks continue, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the weekend, the Ministry of Commerce said that China and the US held two rounds of trade talks via teleconference last week and achieved “new progress”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fed rate increase limits China's central bank's ability to aid economy[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2178939/fed-rate-increase-limits-chinas-central-banks-ability-help]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The talks included “deep exchanges” over issues such as the trade imbalance and intellectual property - two key US grievances - without elaborating further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The talks follow a number of conciliatory gestures by China in the last several weeks, including rolling back additional tariffs on US car imports, placing big orders for US soybeans and de-emphasising the controversial “Made in China 2025” hi-tech industrial strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Exporters are still reluctant to convert USD-denominated proceeds into [yuan] owing to concerns of further [yuan] depreciation,” said Robin Xing at </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> in a research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Policymakers should still be able to … defend the currency against disruptive devaluation.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Suning Appliance Group, one of the China's top home appliance retailers which made its name worldwide last year buying Italian soccer club Inter Milan, saw its shares and bonds plummet on Wednesday morning after the state mouthpiece questioned the rationale of the deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This famous club (Inter Milan) has been making a loss for five years, with total losses amounting to 275.9 million euros. On what purpose would a Chinese company take over it?" asked the host of the state-owned </span><span class="s3">China Central Television</span><span class="s1"> on a TV show on Tuesday morning.</span></p>

Bonds also fell slightly, as "12 Suning 01" traded in Shenzhen fell 0.42 per cent to 99.87 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Suning purchased 70 per cent stake in Italian soccer club Inter Milan for 270 million euros (US$311.61 million) in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past three years, Chinese companies have spent tens of billions euros to buy into more than a dozen world's top soccer clubs playing in the UK, Spain, France, Italy and Germany.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The push was so fierce that Chinese business man Li Yonghong would rather borrow 300 million euros from a London-based hedge fund Elliott Advisors, to complete the 740 million euro deal of acquiring Italian soccer club </span><span class="s3">AC Milan</span><span class="s1"> this April, after Beijing blocked the capital outflow channel for soccer deals.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has moved to assuage concerns that depreciation of the Chinese yuan is in the cards in the wake of a milestone decision by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> to give the currency reserve status recognition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">People's Bank of China deputy governor Yi Gang told reporters on Tuesday[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1885459/more-financial-reforms-store-after-imf-verdict-pboc-deputy] �]that the current controlled float exchange regime will continue, while pledging to transition towards a “clean float”, or a free float mechanism in the future.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our long-term goal is a clean float, which entails little intervention. But under the current managed float mechanism, we have to intervene at times to stabilise the market,” Yi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> on Monday approved the yuan, also known as the renminbi, to be the fifth currency after the US dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen in the SDR basket, a quasi-currency that functions as an accounting unit of the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">, as well as claims and denomination of </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> credits to member countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The verdict is seen as an acknowledgement of China's heft in the global economy, and will give top brass in Beijing further incentive to press ahead with financial and capital account liberalisation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has been seen as a heavy hand in markets to stabilise the exchange rate over the past few months, after a fixing mechanism change in August that resulted in a 3 per cent devaluation which shattered market confidence that the currency was a one-way upward bet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan depreciated as much as 240 basis points or 0.4 per cent to 6.4488 to the dollar as of 7 p.m. Hong Kong time on Tuesday following the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> verdict. The onshore yuan settled at 6.3988, having barely moved over the past week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has been toiling under a depreciation bias given a barrage of weaker major currencies. It has gained 14 per cent from mid-last year on a real effective exchange rate basis, a gauge of a currency's valuation against a group of peers after netting out inflation, according to Bank of International Settlement data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After RMB inclusion in the SDR basket, we think it is likely the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will gradually step away from FX intervention to allow for a more market-determined exchange rate, and regain control over its monetary policy as capital flows become larger on liberalisation,” said Nomura analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They estimate the yuan to trade at 6.75 against the US dollar by the end of 2016, or a 5 per cent depreciation from the current level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Professor Frank M Song at the University of Hong Kong said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had to reinforce market confidence at such a critical juncture.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Re-emphasising a managed float is another way to assure investors at home and abroad that the currency is not on track for sudden depreciation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Theoretically, a clean float means no government intervention, which is a very ideal situation. Only until the capital account is fully convertible and the domestic financial markets are sophisticated enough will a country move towards a clean float. In reality, only a few currencies, including the dollar, euro, pound and yen, are free float,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/2015/12/01/yuan.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the constraints and immaturity in China's financial and foreign exchange regimes, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> gave the yuan greater weighting than that of the pound and the yen, both accounting for bigger shares in global reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> nod also means it considers the yuan to be “freely usable”, a contentious criteria that made the currency miss the cut when it first applied to join the basket in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the next few years, the yuan is expected to snap up a 5 per cent share in global reserves, according to UBS China economist Wang Tao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This would translate into approximately US$450 billion of capital inflows into China. Although such amount will not be enough to offset the capital outflow during the same course,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese yuan weakened on Thursday along with the euro and sterling as the US dollar strengthened on tax reforms proposed by US President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan, which is mainly traded in Shanghai, was at 6.8970 per dollar in early trading on Thursday, down 0.08 per cent from Wednesday when it weakened 0.14 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan, traded in Hong Kong, was down 0.09 per cent on Thursday morning to 6.9018 after it had fallen 0.11 per cent on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weaker yuan came as the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan reference rate at 6.8896 per US dollar, weaker by 0.07 per cent or 51 basis points from Wednesday's fix.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While US tax reform details remain elusive, the bottom line should be dollar positive. We've seen a move higher for the dollar on regional currencies as dollar demand is starting to perk up," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investor confidence in China will be fraught with uncertainty through 2017 as US interest rates are expected to rise and mainland officials deal with the perils of deleveraging the China money ball. Restoring financial stability will be high on the politburo's agenda," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo Cho-yan, chief strategist at King International Financial, said the yuan softened along with the euro and sterling after the latter two currencies hit their strongest levels in recent months as Europe's political situation stabilised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Euro traded at US$1.0912 per US dollar after hitting a five and a half month high on Wednesday at US$1.0950. The euro has been trading strongly since Monday after the first round of the French presidential election showed Emmanuel Macron, who supports France remaining in the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">, as the likely winner in the May 7 run-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sterling softened to US$1.2866 per pound after hitting a six month high last week after Britain announced a general election date in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The yuan, euro and sterling all softened a bit on Thursday as the US dollar has strengthened. This trend is likely to continue as Trump's policy would mean more interest rate rises and economic boost which would support the US dollar. In addition, Italy is going to have presidential election soon which will also add uncertainties to the market," Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar fell to a 14-month low against the US dollar to trade at 7.7818 per US dollar. Lo said the strong US dollar and the low Hong Kong interbank interest rate has led the Hong Kong dollar down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the trend continues Hong Kong lenders may need to increase their interest rate soon to prevent capital outflow. If this happens, it would hurt the stock and property markets," Lo said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fifth interest rate cut since November last year, accompanied by a reduction in banks' reserve requirement ratio, is meant to safeguard a target of 7 per cent annual growth in the world's second-biggest economy this year and stem a stocks sell-off that has seen the Shanghai Composite Index plunge 38 per cent from its year's high in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authorities loosened its curbs on foreigners buying homes and offices as speculative demand has waned, the yuan is expected to depreciate further and property prices unlikely to rebound in the strong pace seen in the past decade. Those rules were in place since 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe this is a measure to support further recovery in the property market, which is a key economic driver in China," said Frank Chen, the head of China research at global property consultant CBRE. "However, it remains a question whether this relaxation can attract new foreign investment, given increasing concern over China's economic slowdown and the yuan's depreciation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has suffered a worsening capital outflow in recent months. A rising number of Chinese firms, including developers and insurers, are stepping up their overseas expansion, while foreign investors have become more cautious about investing in the mainland due to political and economic risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the authorities seek to defend the value of the yuan, economists expect more cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratio will be needed to ease a credit crunch, which will be positive for the housing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week's policy relaxation came just ahead of the real estate industry's traditional busy September-October season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A slew of loosening measures at the end of March heralded an end to the housing market correction in tier-1 cities such as Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, with the trend recently spreading to some tier-2 cities including Hangzhou and Nanjing. However, the vast majority of small cities are still struggling with oversupply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark mortgage rate is now at a record low 5.15 per cent. The latest cut will save homebuyers with a 30-year, 1 million yuan mortgage loan 155 yuan per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with the rate's peak of 7.05 per cent three years ago, buyers will save 1,226 yuan per month, according to calculations by property consultancy </span><span class="s3">China Real Estate Information Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The problem is the lowering of the deposit rate will reduce savings. To lure back savers, banks often offer rates that will compress their margins," CRIC said. "With the latest rate cut, banks are likely to tighten mortgage loans, unless liquidity is very loose."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data from Beijing-based financial product search engine Rong360 showed all banks have ended mortgage discounts to buyers of second homes. Of 528 lenders, 445 asked for a 10 per cent premium, up from 435 in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Banks have loosened first-mortgage-loan policies, which will earn them little net interest margin," Rong360 said. "To balance out, they are expected to charge higher rates on second-home buyers."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Donald Trump's second year in office may prevent China from achieving its target of allowing the yuan to become fully convertible by 2020, according to industry watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US president's economic policies including major tax reforms and interest rate rises aimed at boosting the American economy are likely to strengthen the US dollar against other currencies including the yuan. And that may slow down the process of internationalising the Chinese currency, explains Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China has made it crystal clear that it would like to continue to reform its economy and boost international use of the yuan. The direction of internationalisation of the yuan is clear but the pace of that internationalisation would depend on a lot of social and economic factors,” Yao said on the sidelines of the South China Morning Post's China Conference on Thursday.It's a long way from being used in international financial markets as an investment currencyAidan Yao, AXA Investment Managers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A stronger US dollar would lead to depreciation of the yuan, which would create an adverse effect on the internationalisation of the currency. A fall of the yuan against the US dollar, such as what we saw in 2015 and 2016, makes investors less interested in buying dim sum bonds. China would also need to bring in measures to restrict capital outflows.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's 7 per cent slide against the US dollar in 2016 sparked a tide of funds leaving the mainland as individuals and companies ploughed money into insurance policies, properties, stocks and other assets in Hong Kong and overseas to hedge against the falling currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sales of dim sum bonds - offshore yuan bonds issued in Hong Kong - dropped to a record low as the currency risk put investors off. The amount of yuan deposits in Hong Kong fell by half to about 500 billion yuan at the end of November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since late 2016, Beijing has introduced a string of measures to restrict capital outflows. Meanwhile the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has tightened its control of the fixing rate of the yuan, a move that brought some stability to the currency. The yuan rose 6.8 per cent against the US dollar in 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These measures stemmed the outflows and strengthened the yuan but also slowed the pace at which it was allowed to become a freely traded currency in the international market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As such, Trump's policies would make it difficult for Beijing to achieve its goal for the yuan to become fully convertible in two years' time, Yao explained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Woods, managing director and chief investment officer Asia Pacific at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, said he believed China would not be able to meet the 2020 target.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the China Conference at Hong Kong's JW Marriott hotel, Woods said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">' s numerous measures to control capital outflows had prevented the currency becoming a free-flow currency internationally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not going to happy any time soon,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China started the process of liberalising the yuan 15 years ago by gradually allowing Hong Kong banks to conduct yuan deposit and remittances business. This was later expanded to allow international investors to use the yuan to settle trade and investment transactions. In November 2015, the State Council indicated it would like to see the onshore yuan as an international freely tradeable and usable currency by 2020.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rest of the world has begun to accept the yuan more readily. A major breakthrough came in December 2015 when the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> decided to include the yuan in the Special Drawing Rights, bestowing upon it the status of a reserve currency like the US, euro, pound and yen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frank Newman, chairman, China, of </span><span class="s3">Promontory Financial Group</span><span class="s1"> and former deputy secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, said the yuan would find it hard to compete with the US dollar as a leading reserve currency as there are a lot of foreign investors holding more than US$35 trillion of dollar-denominated assets. Newman was speaking at the same forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">AXA</span><span class="s1">'s Yao believes the yuan could become more widely uses internationally as a trade settlement currency because of the fact it is the world's second largest economy and has a lot of trade partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However it's a long way from being used in international financial markets as an investment currency because the US dollar is dominant in a lot of investment assets worldwide,” he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese banks' bill-financing business could be in the eye of a storm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With police launching investigations into a series of massive fraud cases involving insiders illegally obtaining the bills to invest in stock markets, analysts say a possible tightening of regulations could reduce liquidity in money markets and trigger a panic in stock markets if more cases are exposed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Citic Bank</span><span class="s1">, a banking subsidiary of giant conglomerate China Citic Group, recently revealed a 969 million yuan fraud case. An employee in the bank forged documents to acquire a bill and sold the bill multiple times in order to invest in the once-sizzling stock markets. But the employee was caught in the fourth quarter, media reported, after the Chinese stock markets plunged from a seven-year high in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1"> of China, the country's third-biggest lender by assets, confirmed a similar fraud case last month. Media reports said two employees of the bank illegally sold 3.9 billion yuan worth of bills to obtain cash and invest in the stock markets, but failed to fill the gaps after the markets slumped in the second half of the year. The bank discovered the bills in the safe box had been replaced with newspaper, Caixin reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both China Citic Bank and Agricultural Bank said in separate exchange filings that the police had started investigations.We believe implications for the broader financial market could be more significant as a result of potential tightening of underwriting standardsGoldman Sachs</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A bill, also known as banker's acceptance, is a money market instrument commonly used for short-term corporate financing. It can be sold at discounted prices before its maturity, which is up to six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incidents were exposed shortly after the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> (CBRC) urged banks to strengthen internal risk control in the bill-financing business at the end of December. The CBRC also said it would "tighten" relevant regulations to avoid systemic risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regulatory move and the exposure of the incidents have led to a spike in money market borrowing costs. From January 22 to January 29, the bill interest rates in the Pearl River Delta area and Yangtze River Delta increased by 13 basis points, to 3.73 per mille in the south and 3.68 per mille in the east, according to data from Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the spike in bill interest rates was mainly due to worries over a potential overhaul of the industry and further exposure of such events, rather than the incidents alone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incidents may have limited systemic impacts, as the total risk exposure only accounts for 1 per cent of </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1">'s outstanding loan loss reserve at the end of the 2015 fiscal year and 2 per cent of </span><span class="s3">China Citic Bank</span><span class="s1">'s, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> said in a research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"(However), we believe implications for the broader financial market could be more significant as a result of potential tightening of underwriting standards for the bankers' acceptance business and higher risk aversion among financial institutions in money markets," analysts from the investment bank said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More risk aversion, compounded by potential capital outflow and seasonality, could result in a tightening of financing conditions, especially for small and medium-sized firms, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the next few months, more risk events "cannot be ruled out", due to higher credit risks, short maturity of the bills and A-share market volatility, Goldman forecast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts from </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> had similar opinions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said the incidents had attracted wide investor attention, because they worried that if too much of the funds in the stock market had come from those bills, a potential overhaul might cause "sell offs", leading to heavy falls in the stock market similar to the one in the second half of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although "massive sell-offs" may be unlikely due to the shrinking size of bill discounting after July, the negative impact of the potential overhaul on interest rates and investor sentiment should not be ignored, </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We think enterprises may have more trouble raising funds through bill discounting as the direct discount rates go up," analysts from the securities firm said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, investor sentiment had remained weak after the market collapsed last year, with A-share markets plunging further in the first month of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further exposure of such events could "create more panic in the market and dampen risk appetite", they added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China faced pressures from capital outflows in recent months at a time of rising cross-border volatilities, a senior official at the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1">'s quantitative easing (QE) measures may have huge spillover impacts??on the rest of the world, while it would exert both positive and negative influences on China, Guan Tao, head of the SAFE's department of international payments, told a press conference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Europe-version QE would to some extent alleviate the tightening impact of the US tapering off from its QE policy,??he said. On the other hand, divergent currency policies at the world's main economies may affect the exchange rates between major currencies, which will intensify volatilities on the international financial market.??/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ECB's monetary policy decision is due at 8:45pm Beijing time today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Guan said the mainland may have seen a pattern of current account surplus and capital account deficit??in the fourth quarter last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks sold a net US$46.5 billion in foreign exchange settlements last quarter, from a deficit of $16 billion in the third, after registering surpluses in the first half, data from SAFE showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital flows volatilities are mainly affected by three major factors: widened two-way exchange rate fluctuation, a strengthening US dollar, and new risks in domestic economic operations, Guan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the market-oriented reform on the yuan exchange rate mechanism is pushed ahead, the central bank has gradually withdrawn from frequent intervention in the foreign exchange market. The pattern of trade surplus and capital outflows??is set to become more normalized,??he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Guan said such an adjustment remains appropriate and endurable??given ample liquidity in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said while the yuan weakened against the dollar in 2014, it remained relatively strong??against other major currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's nominal effective exchange rate index, which measures the relative strength of a currency relative to a basket of other currencies, appreciated by 6.4 per cent last year, while the real rate adjusted for inflation gained 6.2 per cent, both hitting record highs, he said, citing data from </span><span class="s3">Bank for International Settlements</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's economic growth is set to speed up next year as advanced economies begin to recover. But the city's property market still looks shaky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An expected tapering of the US Federal Reserve's stimulus could spark a capital outflow from Hong Kong, which together with market-cooling measures could slash property prices by 10 per cent, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citi Research and Standard Chartered Bank respectively forecast Hong Kong's gross domestic product will jump by 3.4 per cent and 4 per cent next year, compared to 3 per cent this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong infrastructure investments and better exports following continuous recovery in the US and the euro-zone economies will help jump-start growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But both expected the year to have a bumpy start as a reduction in the Fed's bond buying - which could start as early as March - may draw capital out of the city's equity market. They believe the magnitude would be moderate given Hong Kong's connection to mainland China and its leverage as an offshore yuan market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior rates strategist at Standard Chartered Becky Liu said the issuance of dim sum bonds in Hong Kong may jump to HK$500 billion next year from HK$360 billion this year in light of redemption of maturing bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adrienne Lui, an economist at Citi, expects Beijing to relax or lift the cap on the daily conversion amount between yuan and Hong Kong dollars to mark the 10th anniversary of the launch of yuan banking business in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong's property prices could fall by 10 per cent despite growth improving, as the government's market-cooling measures are expected to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Officials said the measures can be reversed in light of a sharp fall in property prices, but what they meant by sharp could be a correction of between 20 and 30 per cent. A drop of 10 per cent is well within their expectation," Lui said, adding that such a decline will not affect local consumption and the capital market, and is, in fact, healthy as it gives the government enough time to increase the housing supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two firms expected mainland economic growth to recede to around 7.3 per cent next year, although Citi projected heavier inflation of 4 per cent, which may prompt China to raise interest rates by 25 basis points towards the end of 2014. At the same time, the yuan is expected to appreciate by 1 to 2 per cent against the US dollar on the back of further liberalisation of the capital account, but there will be further tightening of liquidity in China in light of worsening government debts, the analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Johanna Chua from Citi said growth in some emerging markets like Malaysia and the Philippines will slow, as they were not direct beneficiaries of booming demand for hi-tech products like smartphones and tablets. South Korea and Taiwan, meanwhile, would be regional winners.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Moody's Investors Service</span><span class="s1">, the rating agency that five months ago downgraded China's sovereign rating, said in a report last week that Xi's second-term power consolidation "could advance the process of economic reform and rebalancing".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That view was echoed by Michael Pettis, a long-time observer of the Chinese economy, who told the South China Morning Post that a strong leader would help China to clean up its debt mess and put growth on a sustainable track.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maxed-out China needs a strong leader to fix its debt mess, economist Michael Pettis says[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2117485/maxed-out-china-needs-strong-leader-fix-its-debt-mess-economist]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-backed investment bank </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> meanwhile wrote in a note on Monday that the bears were wrong "again and again" about China because they did not understand the country's vast potential to grow. It said fears about a bust in China's debt-fuelled growth were overblown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qiu Xiaohua, who headed </span><span class="s3">China's National Bureau of Statistics</span><span class="s1"> from 2005 to 2006, is the latest to predict the US$12 trillion economy is about to turn a corner.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A new cycle and phase - characterised by stable and high-quality growth - is coming to us," Qiu, who is now chief economist at Minsheng Securities, said at a ceremony to launch the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s latest China Economic Outlook on Tuesday in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing investment bank: why the bears are wrong about China's economy[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2117617/beijing-investment-bank-why-bears-are-wrong-about-chinas-economy]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qiu said the country's "political advantages" had helped it to avoid a financial meltdown, noting that the doomsayers often neglected non-market factors in analysing China's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"An important reason why foreign investors tend to misjudge the Chinese economy or take a pessimistic view is that they don't look into the close relations between the country's politics and economics," Qiu said. Its bureaucratic system, "from the central government to the villages", is expected to run more efficiently now that Xi has cemented his grip on power, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qiu's political career ended abruptly in 2006 when he was investigated for corruption then jailed for bigamy. He was released in 2008 and joined the private sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The economic optimists have been emboldened by this year's accelerating growth figures, and by Beijing managing to halt a 22-month exodus of cash in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stems capital outflow after 22 months of bleeding money[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2116329/china-stems-capital-outflow-after-22-months-bleeding-money]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Monthly indicators such as the purchasing manager's index have also pointed to strong momentum. The official PMI for October fell by 0.8 percentage points from a five-year high of 52.4 the previous month - meaning it has been in expansionary territory for nearly a year. The separate Caixin manufacturing PMI released on Wednesday stayed unchanged at 51, marking expansion of activities for five months in a row.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xi dropped a long-term gross domestic product growth target in his political report delivered to the 19th party congress last month, turning the focus to quality of growth instead of speed of expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, economists have been busy revising up their forecasts for China growth. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> last month added 0.2 percentage points to its forecast for 2017, taking it to 6.8 per cent, and it revised up the 2018 growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 6.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Longmei, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s resident representative in China, said the country now had a "good opportunity" to tackle its structural problems - from corporate debt to financial fragility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The core challenge remains its excessive reliance on debt for growth," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Wei Benhua, former deputy director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said Beijing had enough assets to repay its debt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Guizhou province has a very high level of government debt, but all its debts could be repaid if it sold just one company - Kweichow Moutai," Wei said. Kweichow Moutai, China's top liquor maker partly owned by the Guizhou government, has a market capitalisation of more than US$100 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, although profitability of Chinese state companies is improving - and even state banks are reporting strong earnings - doubts about the sustainability of the Chinese economy remain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou Xiaochuan, the country's veteran central bank governor, warned two weeks ago that too much optimism could lead to a "Minsky moment", a term named after US economist Hyman Minsky that refers to a sudden collapse of asset prices after long periods of prosperity or growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's central bank chief says too much optimism could cause a ‘Minsky moment'[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2116149/chinas-central-bank-chief-says-too-much-optimism-could-cause]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Kyle Bass, the founder of Hayman Capital who predicted a bank crisis in China and a 30 per cent devaluation of its currency in early 2016, said last week that Xi "will be blamed for recklessly building the Chinese economy on a foundation of sand", Bloomberg reported.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For any film producer from Hollywood, receiving an Oscar at the annual Academy Awards would be a milestone to kick off a round of celebrations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not so for Beijing-based Perfect World, which co-produced two of this year's Oscar-winning films - Darkest Hour and Phantom Thread.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was business as usual at the low-key entertainment conglomerate, with offices in the Chinese capital's sprawling Chaoyang District, even as staff watched the live broadcast on Monday of those two films scooping up a combined three Oscar statues at the 90th Academy Awards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Darkest Hour won awards for Best Actor as well as Best Makeup and Hairstyling, while Phantom Thread won for Best Costume Design.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another film that Perfect World co-produced, Victoria &amp; Abdul, had two Oscar nominations this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those three films are part of a US$500 million slate that was forged in 2016 between subsidiary Perfect World Pictures and </span><span class="s3">Universal Pictures</span><span class="s1">. Under that deal, Perfect World will help fund the production of 50 </span><span class="s3">Universal</span><span class="s1"> films over five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's why China has a lot staked on these two best-picture Oscar contenders[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2135365/heres-why-china-has-lot-staked-these-two-best]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese technology companies, including the likes of Baidu, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, have been investing heavily in content and other intellectual property - producing television series and films as well as operating subscription-based video-streaming platforms - as they race to carve out market share in the international entertainment industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are following the lead of the major Hollywood film studios, which have built a sustainable business model by taking the films and other intellectual property they own into a range of revenue-generating activities, from theme parks to video games and video streaming services to licensed consumer merchandise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Pictures Group</span><span class="s1">, the film arm of South China Morning Post owner Alibaba, became a minority stakeholder in Steven Spielberg's </span><span class="s3">Amblin Partners</span><span class="s1"> in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Chinese companies have snapped up trophy assets in Hollywood. The biggest of those deals was Chinese property and entertainment giant </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">'s US$3.5 billion acquisition of </span><span class="s3">Legendary Entertainment</span><span class="s1"> in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having an award-winning film is widely expected to help burnish the credentials of these Chinese companies now involved in Hollywood alliances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Berry, a professor of contemporary Chinese cultural studies at the </span><span class="s3">University of California, Los Angeles</span><span class="s1">, believes it is still rare for a Chinese company to be part of the film awards season's winners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's big Hollywood investment: all about making friends and influencing people[http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/arts-music/article/2079036/chinas-big-hollywood-investment-all-about-making]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For many years, an Academy Award has proved to be an elusive prize for Chinese filmmakers, Berry said. “Perfect World's financing of prestige films provides an alternative access to the world of Oscar.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the 2016 Academy Awards, Chinese provincial broadcaster Hunan TV basked in the glow of international box-office hit La La Land after it took home six Oscars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hunan TV subsidiary TIK Films co-financed that musical romantic comedy-drama, which grossed US$446 million worldwide, under a multiple-film co-financing pact with </span><span class="s3">Lionsgate Entertainment Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither Phantom Thread or Darkest Hour - produced at a budget of US$35 million and US$30 million, respectively - became a global blockbuster. Phantom Thread and Darkest Hour grossed a global total of US$38 million and US$138.5 million, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clayton Dube, head of the US-China Institute at the </span><span class="s3">University of Southern California (USC)</span><span class="s1">, said a best picture award would have “certainly boosted either film's net receipts, including later DVD sales, rentals and streaming franchise films”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Perfect World is more than a film financier. It was founded in 2004 by internet entrepreneur Michael Chi Yufeng as an online video game developer and operator. It is China's third-largest gaming company after Tencent Holding and NetEase, and the world's 21st biggest gaming company by revenue, according to research film Newzoo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two years after graduating from the prestigious </span><span class="s3">Tsinghua University</span><span class="s1">, Chi founded Beijing Hongen Education and Technology Co in 1996. That company sold educational software to teach Chinese consumers how to use personal computers and learn English.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2007, Perfect World Games became a publicly listed company trading on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> stock market. A year later, Chi established Perfect World Pictures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, Perfect World Games went private and delisted from </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">. Like other Chinese businesses, including </span><span class="s3">Qihoo 360</span><span class="s1">, the company planned to go public in China for a better valuation because of high market ratings for internet and entertainment firms on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2016, Perfect World Games joined China's A-share market through a back door listing with sister company Perfect World Pictures. The two firms merged and now trades in the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> as Perfect World.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, with about 5,000 employees, has a market capitalisation worth US$6.8 billion. In its first-half earnings report last year, its gaming business made up 86 per cent of its total US$57 million revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from developing its own games, Perfect World is also the China distributor of several global hit video game titles, including Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company had previously acquired Seattle-based computer game developer Runic Game and video game producer </span><span class="s3">Cryptic Studios</span><span class="s1"> from California.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Perfect World spokesman said the </span><span class="s3">Universal</span><span class="s1"> deal enabled the company “to spread our risks to finance 50 films running up to five years”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the mainland, Perfect World had also produced the romantic comedy Sophie's Revenge, starring Zhang Ziyi, in 2009, and the Chinese hit Love Is Not Blind in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese companies are scrambling to invest in Hollywood studios as it is the best way for them to tap into the overseas markets,” said Eric Qiu, an analyst at CCB International. “It's a way for them to diversify their portfolios instead of only focusing on domestic film productions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Of course political uncertainties, including control on capital outflow, will always remain, but for now it seems Beijing does not mind that much for firms investing in the overseas entertainment and film industry,” Qiu said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Chinese company represented at this year's Academy Awards was Beijing-based </span><span class="s3">Huayi Brothers Media Corp</span><span class="s1">, a co-financier of Molly's Game, which received an adapted screenplay nomination.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies' overseas investment plans, however, have been put under greater scrutiny by the central government since last year, as Beijing moved to stem record capital outflows and subsequent downward pressure on the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Entertainment and real estate transactions have been singled out as “chief target sectors”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Perfect World is not making big gambles and is learning how to identify quality projects,” said USC's Dube. “Learning how to make prestige projects like Darkest Hour or Phantom Thread will be increasingly important as China's population ages and audiences grow less enamoured over formulaic and special effects films.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year, Perfect Film will co-produce at least two franchise films with </span><span class="s3">Universal Pictures</span><span class="s1"> - Fifty Shades Freed and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The popular dinosaur franchise is already confirmed to be released in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's currency regulator has urged investors not to be confused by noise from overseas firms "talking down" the yuan and vowed China has the ability to defend the currency, also known as renminbi (RMB).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guan Tao, the head of the department of international payments at the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), said in a Q&amp;A interview in the official Economic Daily that investors should not worry about the bearish view of the yuan expressed by the foreign institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Don't be confused by the talk of the foreign institutions who have kept talking that the yuan will go down," he said. "This is because when they said the yuan may go down it does not mean the yuan will definitely go down. There may be some institutions that want to take profit from their portfolio by spreading bearish views and lead the mainland firms and public to feel panic and rush to sell the RMB. The rational Chinese institutions and families should not become these foreign institutions' scissors for shearing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China has determination and ability to defend the yuan from devaluation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said people should remember the lesson of 1994 when China devalued the yuan in one hit from 5.80 to 8.70 against the US dollar, with many market players predicting the yuan might further devalue to the nine or 10 level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But in reality, the yuan did not depreciate but appreciated 3 per cent that year, while the foreign reserves doubled," Guan said. " The yuan has since risen to become a strong currency. The investors who sell short the yuan have not been able to gain."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guan said that although the yuan has devalued by about 4 per cent to 5 per cent against the US dollar last year, it had still appreciated against a basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the devaluation of the yuan has led to capital outflow and the foreign exchange reserves were down. However, China still had sufficient reserves the defend the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The future outlook of the yuan will be subject to a number of elements," he said. "The economic slowdown is a key reason for the recent devaluation of the yuan. The mainland economy is slowing down but the economic growth is still higher than many developed countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The strong US dollar is also a reason for the devaluation of the yuan but we should also note that the US is increasing its interest rate, which means it is also facing a bumpy road ahead."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan declined slightly on Wednesday morning ahead of a flurry of potentially market-moving events in several major economies today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan in Hong Kong fell for a third day, down 0.03 per cent, or 21 points, to trade at 6.9012 as of 10.55 am. Onshore yuan in Shanghai also slipped for a third straight day, slipping 0.03 per cent, or 19 points, to 6.9156.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> guided the midpoint rate up by 3 basis points to 6.9115. Traders in the mainland are allowed to trade the currency within a 2 per cent range of the guided price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday that in the event of a trade war with the US, it would be primarily American enterprises that suffer. In his annual news conference at the end of the National People's Congress, Li said GDP growth of 6.5 per cent is not a low target and achieving it would be no easy task.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is expected to raise its key interest rate later today at the end of a two-day meeting of its policy-setting committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Despite a likely faster pace of US Fed rate hikes this year, the US dollar has lost some of its strength since the end of last year,” said UBS economist Wang Tao in a report. “We now also think that major US-China trade frictions may be delayed and played outside of the dollar-yuan arena.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These factors and China's tighter capital outflow controls will make it easier to manage Chinese yuan stability.” </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> believes the yuan is unlikely to end 2017 beyond 7.15 versus the dollar, higher than its previous estimate of 7.3.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dollar was slightly down on Wednesday morning against a basket of its major peers as investors priced in the near-certainty of a rate rise being announced later today. The dollar index had dropped 0.01 per cent to 101.69 as of 10.55 am.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders will be watching elections in the Netherlands, which get under way today - the first of three major elections in Europe this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Bank of Japan</span><span class="s1"> commences its two-day monetary policy meeting today. The yen was 0.01 per cent lower at 114.87.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Thursday the </span><span class="s3">Bank of England</span><span class="s1"> will announce its rate decision. The British pound strengthened 0.02 per cent to 1.2155 against the dollar, while the euro was 0.13 per cent up at 1.0615.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A plea from China's outgoing central bank governor for a freer yuan has focused attention on the institutional obstacles stopping the country from integrating into the world's financial market, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what could be one of his last major interviews in the top job, Zhou Xiaochuan, the veteran </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">governor who is expected to retire soon, told Chinese magazine Caijing that China should seize the moment to let the market decide the yuan's value and scrap capital account controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou's call for reform came amid speculation that China's leadership is veering away from liberalisation towards a more nationalistic and centralised approach to managing the world's second-biggest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The interview, published days before the Communist Party meets to decide on a new leadership line-up, underscored Zhou's long-standing liberal monetary views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said it was also reminder to the country's future leaders and financial technocrats of what needs to be done to make China an open economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's central bank chief makes reform appeal: please free up the yuan[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2114601/chinas-central-bank-chief-makes-reform-appeal-please-free-yuan]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Zhiwu, director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong, said Zhou's comments could be a reminder for those who come after him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The interview sounds like a farewell report and a briefing to his successor, something like ‘you need to move on with the yuan's global push, capital account opening and free trade'," Chen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is also advice targeted at China's top decision makers as well as his colleagues ... those who could influence future policy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, it's an open question whether China's leaders will take heed that advice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhao Yang, chief China economist at </span><span class="s3">Nomura International</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong, said freeing up the capital account was a long-term task and leaders had other priorities now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Given the capital outflow pressure, the government priority will be to lure capital inflows," Zhao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a pro-market champion, Zhou can count the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s decision to give the yuan nominal international reserve currency status as one of his achievements in his 15 years as PBOC governor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the interview published on Monday, Zhou said risk aversion and turf wars had held back further market liberalisation in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said free trade, a free exchange rate and free capital flows were an indivisible "trinity" but China's bureaucracy had turned them into separate entities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should also not wait for "conditions" to be ripe to free up the exchange rate system, nor should it drag its feet for fear of mistiming other reforms, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the barriers that stopped Zhou, 69, from getting things done would persist. Those stumbling blocks included the central bank's role as a unit within the cabinet, their sometimes conflicting policy goals, and the debate over whether the state or the market should take the upper hand.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yukon Huang, a senior fellow at </span><span class="s3">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</span><span class="s1"> and a former World Bank country director for China, said reform came down to one major question.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is just one big issue, which is the contradiction between the roles of the state and the market," Huang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They have contradictory statements - the decisive role for the market against the leading role for the state … I doubt whether it will be resolved in the statement that comes out of the party congress."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Ming, a senior researcher with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">, said Beijing's political goal of ensuring financial stability would trump any liberalisation push.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will be hard to push forward [liberalisation] in the short term … There are still many limits and considerations," Zhang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, the influence of "reformist" school in China's policymaking is waning. Former finance minister Lou Jiwei, who shared many of Zhou's views, stepped down a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen said people like Zhou and Lou were economic management professionals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If they are replaced by people who are too politically motivated then there will be more uncertainty for society and the economy as a whole," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has warned of capital outflows and volatility on the bond and equity markets once the United States starts to taper its quantitative easing scheme after nearly five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About HK$100 billion had flowed into the banking system since the financial crisis in 2008, Norman Chan Tak-lam, the chief executive of the Monetary Authority, told a financial summit yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That capital would "inevitably" flow out if the interest rate cycle in the US changed, and Hong Kong had to face the outflow pressure just like other emerging markets, Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is filled with uncertainties, and the investment environment is quite complicated," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said there would not be a specific timetable for the tapering or total exit from the quantitative easing scheme, as the timing would be determined by the condition of the US economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet markets have been expecting the US Federal Reserve to officially announce the tapering of its treasury bond purchase plan after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 18.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US reported solid jobs and services sector data on Thursday, with new jobless claims falling to a nearly five-year low. The ISM non-manufacturing index, which reflects business conditions in the services sector, jumped to a seven-year high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But yesterday it reported a slowdown in hiring.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Quantitative easing through Fed purchases of bonds was introduced during the global financial crisis to increase money supply and boost lending to revive the economy. The scheme has helped keep government borrowing costs and mortgage rates around the world low. An exit from it would push up rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA is "closely watching" the US central bank for signs of its readiness to exit the scheme and is gauging its likely impact on the markets, Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked whether emerging markets would experience another sell-off like the one in June, he said this time the impact could be smaller, as the Fed initially was likely to make just a mild reduction in the size of its bond purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also said the HKMA had been working on strategies to cope with volatile markets to maintain the safety of the city's foreign exchange reserves. In July, Hong Kong had US$299.9 billion in reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Up to 79 per cent of the assets in the Exchange Fund, which is used to manage the reserves, was denominated in US dollars last year, the HKMA said in its annual report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bulk of the fund, under the "backing portfolio", was invested in highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, while another portfolio was invested in the local market, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's falling stock and currency markets yesterday chilled the sales of Harbour Park, the first residential property project launched after market turmoil sent the local interest rate to a historical high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only eight units of Harbour Park, a small-unit property project in Cheung Sha Wan developed by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Ferry</span><span class="s1"> , a subsidiary of Henderson Land, were bought in the morning, an agency source said. The developer declined to disclose the sales amount. The number of transactions in the afternoon was very low, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier local media reports said </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Ferry</span><span class="s1"> would open sales for 70 units of Harbour Park yesterday. The project is made up of small flats in sizes ranging from 204 to 275 sq ft, priced between HK$14,894 and HK$17,975 per square foot. The cheapest unit in this batch of sales cost HK$2.967 million after discounts, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Ferry</span><span class="s1"> earlier said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The pricing of Harbour Park is reasonable. But ... investment sentiment has been severely hit by the stock market plummet and weak local currency," said Sammy Po, chief executive of Midland Realty residential department. "People are getting more prudent when making decisions, particularly those who saw their wealth shrink in the stock market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Po said it was unlikely property sales would improve unless the stock markets saw an uptick.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, </span><span class="s3">Henderson Land Development</span><span class="s1"> will offer its luxury project Wellesley on Mid-Levels for pre-sale to test the market. The company's share price has plunged some 20 per cent in recent weeks, closing at HK$38.45 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dragged by concerns over the Chinese economy and a global sell-off triggered by fear of a financial crisis, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index extended a fourth consecutive week of losses last week. The index has tumbled about 13 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar also extended a three-week fall as capital outflow continued after the United States' interest rate increase took effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following the weakening currency, local borrowing costs rose with overnight funding cost to a five-year high of 0.44 per cent on Friday. And the one-month Hong Kong interbank rate, or Hibor, rose to 0.39 per cent, according to the Treasury Markets Association, largely pulling up the mortgage rate, which meant bigger burdens for those who had financed their properties with loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Helped by flexible incentives from the developers, property sales in Hong Kong bounced back last month, but total sales volume was still 30 per cent down from the same period a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect home prices to enter a downward cycle that could last two to three years, with a cumulative drop of more than 30 per cent from its peak.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's local government financing vehicles are quietly catching up with real estate companies as the main seller in the US dollar bond market, riding on increased appetite for dollar assets mainly from Chinese banks' overseas branches.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A flurry of such vehicles, known as LGFVs overseas and "Chengtou" in China, are busy these days with roadshows in Hong Kong, Singapore and London. Bloomberg data showed that so far in November, US$1.81 billion worth of such bonds were sold, compared to US$520 million sold by homebuilders, which used to be the mainstay issuers of high-yield US dollar bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US$9.67 billion issued by LGFV's so far this year still lags behind that of real estate's US$12.1 billion, Bloomberg data showed. But LGFVs are picking up momentum while real estate is losing it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">LGFVs are government-related entities engaged in construction or operation of public welfare and infrastructure projects, often on a non-profit basis. Local governments are usually LGFV's largest customers, and often provide some level of grants or subsidies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chengdu Xingcheng Investment on Tuesday sold its five-year US$300 million bonds at 3.25 per cent coupon, with a 4.5 times oversubsription. This followed earlier offers by Yancheng Oriental, Shanxi Road &amp; Bridge, Suqian Economic Development, and Jiangsu Zhongguancun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Changsha Pilot, Zhenjiang Transport Industry Group and Shanxi Xixian New Area are ready for their international debut, while Tieling Public Asset Investment and Management plans a US$200 million issuance before year-end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The growing number of sales follows investors' bigger appetite for US dollar assets amid an outlook for a strong dollar and weaker yuan, and fewer such offerings from central government-owned enterprises and major private corporations in China, bankers and analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From the supply side, LGFVs are willing to diversify their funding channels - even coupons for US dollar bonds are still higher than onshore notes. They also seek to raise their overseas profile and have been encouraged by regulators' lenient attitude. China's foreign exchange administration eased the restrictions on proceeds raised offshore for domestic use amid China's capital outflow, a debt capital market (DCM) banker told the Post.Foreign institutions typically asked for a near 6 per cent yield for such non-investment bonds, while Chinese banks can accept 5.25 to 5.5 per centLei Qiang, </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although billed as offshore financing, a majority of LGFV bond buyers are still Chinese banks, albeit their overseas subsidiaries. Lei Qiang, a DCM banker with </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong, said foreign banks and funds only take 20 to 30 per cent of the pie as they are more wary of the risks and demand a higher yield for compensation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Foreign institutions typically asked for a near 6 per cent yield for such non-investment bonds, while Chinese banks can accept 5.25 to 5.5 per cent. They are also more familiar with what LGFVs are," Lei said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some major credit rating agencies are ringing the alarm bells. Ivan Chung, head of greater China credit research at </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1">, said some of the high-yield LGFVs don't have quality assets or steady cash flows and are already facing funding difficulties onshore. Therefore, issuing public deals have become challenging so some have turned to issuing private placement notes instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chinese investors don't seem to care. Lei said in the aftermath of the Chinese government's property tightening measures, yields of real estate bonds increased by 1.5 to 2 percentage points while those of LGFV bonds barely moved. This is despite the fact that the repayment ability of LGFVs is tightly linked with local governments, whose revenues are in turn closely linked with land sales.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hao Zhou, a lawyer with King &amp; Wood Mallesons, who has advised on a majority of such deals, said from the legal standpoint the offering documents customarily disclose risk factors that investors should consider, including the fact that such LGFV bonds are not considered as local government debt so investors would have no legal recourse to the governments if the LGFVs faced repayment difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, investors might take a speculative stance because no single LGFV has defaulted in the market. "Perhaps only a default case can pull the strings," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's fund management industry will be reshaped by alternative investment strategies and risk management capabilities as global fund houses gain entry as wholly-owned enterprises for the first time in the nation's modern history, according to fund experts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A trio of global fund houses comprising Principal Global Investors, BlackRock and Investec say the private fund management (PFM) licence represents a major opening of China's onshore market, which will bring positive benefits to the nation's savers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, investors will have additional choices on how to invest, including more higher yielding products, according to fund experts speaking on the sidelines of JPMorgan Global China Summit last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Wiseman, global head of active equities for </span><span class="s3">BlackRock</span><span class="s1">, said he considers the ability for foreign managers to access China under the PFM licence as the single largest business opportunity for </span><span class="s3">BlackRock</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With one of the highest saving rates in the world, a rising middle class, an ageing population and yet a country in the early stage of developing its social safety net such as pension and healthcare, there is a massive need for professional and reliable saving products in China,” he said. “Global asset managers and institutional investors alike can help bring more discipline to this market, which is still dominated by retail investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December 2017, </span><span class="s3">BlackRock</span><span class="s1"> joined foreign fund houses Invesco, </span><span class="s3">Schroders</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Neuberger Berman</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1">, and Hong Kong-based </span><span class="s3">Value Partners</span><span class="s1"> in attaining the status of a private securities investment manager under the PFM licence. In the past, foreign managers were restricted to taking a minority stake in a joint venture with a Chinese partner. However, the PFM licence allows foreign fund managers to launch private funds for up to 200 qualified investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The PFM licence also means Chinese investors can tap into more financial products, including those involving credit investing and alternative strategies, Wiseman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jim McCaughan, chief executive of Principal Global Investors, said his company, which has a minority stake in a mainland joint venture, has been helping Chinese investors and insurers channel funds into international securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the company is seeking to build up its mainland joint venture in line with leading market standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As Chinese investors become wealthier, they are more likely to diversify their investment internationally. Through our joint venture we are bringing global best practices and risk management into the Chinese market,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April China announced it would resume its QDII programme, issuing a new batch of quota worth US$8.3 billion. The scheme was suspended in early 2015 amid concerns of capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another outbound investment programme called the qualified domestic limited partners, which allows foreign managers to raise capital from Chinese investors for offshore hedge funds, was also revived this year, reversing a decision to halt the programme in 2016 due to capital outflow and yuan depreciation concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Hendrik du Toit, chief executive of Investec Asset Management, said China is one of the few emerging markets that has managed to systematically develop its capital market in a sensible way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Chinese authorities have shown a deep understanding in opening up their capital market. The step-by-step approach and caution is justified, given the high stakes involved,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jing Ulrich, JPMorgan vice-chairman of Asia Pacific, said uncertainties in the global financial market have slowed down the pace of China's ongoing efforts in internationalising the yuan as the leadership's priority now is on financial de-risking and de-leveraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Given the US$20 trillion savings pool in China earning low returns in the banking system, Chinese retail investors are fast becoming an important source of capital for portfolio investments globally,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong consumers won't see any change in the interest paid on their savings and deposits, despite the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> following the Fed and raising interest rates on lending in the city by 0.25 per cent, at least for the immediate future, after banks chose not to adjust their prime lending rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts said declining liquidity in the system could mean that interest rates may rise in 2017, depending on the pace of capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, Bank of China Hong Kong and Hang Seng said they would keep their prime lending rates at 5 per cent, while </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1">, and Dah Sing Bank said that they would keep theirs at 5.25 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">, which also offers a prime rate of 5.25 had not announced any change at the time of going to print.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Savers, however, will still earn rates of less than 0.01 per cent on their deposits across the city's different banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither lending nor saving rates has changed since November 2008, despite both Thursday's interest rate rise and one in December 2015.The aggregate balance is at approximately HK$250bn. While it has fallen from near HK$400bn in the past year or so, when we last had to think about interest rate rises, ten years or so ago, it was not until the aggregate balance was down to about HK$10 billionGeorge Leung Siu-Kay, advisor, HSBC Asia-Pacific</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, while last year's rate rise did not affect the prime rates banks offered to lendings, this year's may be different, due to the amount of capital that is now starting to leave Hong Kong, suggested analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When setting interest rates all eyes are on HIBOR [the Hong Kong inter-bank offered rate],” George Leung Siu-Kay, an advisor at HSBC Asia Pacific told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If HIBOR, the benchmark rate at which banks lend to each other, rises significantly, then they would need to raise interest rates to attract more savings to fund their activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung also added that as Hong Kong's aggregate balance, which represents the level of interbank liquidity is at an ample level, HIBOR would not be expected to rise quickly.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The aggregate balance is at approximately HK$250 billion,” Leung said. “While it has fallen from near HK$400 billion in the past year or so, when we last had to think about interest rate rises, ten years or so ago, it was not until the aggregate balance was down to about HK$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Assuming there's no crisis, we might not have to start thinking about rate rises for another year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tommy Ong, however, head of wealth management solutions, treasury and markets at DBS, expects HIBOR to come under pressure sooner because of capital outflows, and predicted banks to raise their prime rates towards the middle of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At one time Hong Kong used to be considered a safe haven for capital,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Its banking system aggregate balance has been coming down, but there's still a cushion, which is lower than it was, and that reflects capital outflow.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists suggest that the faster capital leaves the city, the lower Hong Kong's aggregate balance, and hence the sooner banks will raise their rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A faster pace of rate increases in the US would likely accelerate this process, they said, as investing in the US would become more attractive.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Low &amp; Bonar</span><span class="s1">, the British maker of high performance materials used in flooring and the building industry, is doubling production at its facility in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, buoyed by strong demand from Chinese customers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett Simpson, its chief executive, also told the South China Morning Post that the extra production line at the plant, about 160 kilometers northwest of Shanghai, will be operational by 2018 to reinforce its expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's is a growing and very important part of our global strategy,” Simpson said. “In the areas where we are investing, we see solid underlying trends.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which has its roots in Dundee in Scotland, started building the wholly-owned factory in Changzhou in 2015, and launched operations there last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Presently, 60 million square metres of its “Colback” product, a widely used non-woven material used in the backing of carpet tiles, wall-to-wall carpeting, mats and moulded car carpets, can be produced in the factory each year. Expanding the facility will cost about 200 million yuan (US$29 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Low &amp; Bonar</span><span class="s1">'s products are also used in roofing, air and water filtration, road and rail construction and decorative products.China's is a growing and very important part of our global strategy,” Simpson said. “In the areas where we are investing, we see solid underlying trends</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its Chinese sales are worth about 40 million euros (US$42.4 million) annually, and represent nearly a tenth of its global business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simpson now predicts the firm's expansion lies in Asia, and mainly China, and that the region will account for a third of its total sales worldwide, on par with its operations in Europe and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Simpson said business growth in China was largely beating its average rate worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Colback product can be used in residential and commercial properties, but its focus here in the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Changzhou factory was the company's first production site outside of Europe and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We tend to make products close to their market,” said Simpson. “We can transfer our best technologies into China, build here, and develop our local team.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's urbanisation drive, the rising affluence of its middle classes, and efforts to upgrade its industrial mix are increasingly ushering in demand for higher-quality materials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There have been mounting worries, however, over its industrial outlook, which is saddled with industrial overcapacity, lofty debt levels and increasing capital outflow, although Simpson is remarkably upbeat about his firm's prospects in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said it was wrong to use the example of areas that were slowing down, to allude to an overall weak economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland governments have been striving to digest redundant office buildings and residential properties in low-tier cities following a round of reckless construction spree over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China loosens policy on commercial buildings to reduce oversupply, but analysts sceptical[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/1985169/china-loosens-policy-commercial-buildings-reduce-oversupply]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to global property service firm JLL, office buildings are now falling in price amid a new wave of supply, and competition for the best site is escalating</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Joe Zhou, JLL's head of research in China, said that proper urban planning and synergies created between different cities could help ease the pain being suffered by some in the country's real estate industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Good coordination among local governments is needed,” he said. “Some industries would be better advised to move out from major metropolises to neighbouring smaller cities.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is expected to announce another monthly rise in its foreign exchange reserves on Thursday in the latest sign that the country's central bank has won the battle to curb the country's capital exodus and defend the exchange rate of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists said the continued rise in the yuan marked a complete change in sentiment regarding the currency and some predicted that the bank may loosen currency controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two key numbers highlight the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s goals: the number seven, referring to the exchange rate between dollar and the yuan, and the number three - namely the US$3 trillion line in China's reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Late last year and early this year both looked like big tests as the yuan traded at a level of 6.95 last Christmas and the foreign exchange reserves briefly dipped below US$3 trillion at the end of January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday, the yuan had strengthened against the greenback to 6.53, helped by a weakening dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among all 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, all of them expected that China's reserves at the end of August would be above US$3 trillion and only five of them expected a slight fall from the end of July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why does China still have a ‘pegged' currency, like those of Iran, Laos, Belarus?[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2109845/why-does-china-still-have-pegged-currency-those-iran-laos-belarus]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[China's] battle against the depreciation expectations has been successful, just like the one against capital outflows,” Larry Hu, chief China economist of Macquarie Securities wrote in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the yuan exchange rate could appreciate further to 6.5 as the end of 2017 and has a “pretty high” chance of reaching 6.4 in the following 12 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Jian, an analyst with the Bank of Communications in Shanghai, said market sentiment about the yuan has completely changed from a few months earlier as the exchange rate easily cleared key hurdles of 6.8, 6.7 and 6.6, prompting those shorting the yuan to close their positions and exporters to sell dollars for yuan “as early as possible”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The concerns about yuan's prospects, once “deeply planted in investors' minds”, have largely gone, relieving pressure on capital outflows for China and reducing financial risks, Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rise in yuan value and the foreign exchange reserves follow a series of measures from Beijing that marked a move away from liberalisation. These included draconian controls over outbound payments and remittances and the adoption of a murky counter cyclical factor in setting the central parity price of yuan on every trading day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the yuan value and the foreign reserve size falling within the safe lines, China may loosen its restrictions on individual foreign exchange purchases the coming months, </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> economists led by Liang Hong wrote in a note this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China may again see net capital inflows in the coming years, a factor that could lead to “revaluation” of onshore assets, CICC economists added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Has Beijing learnt the right lesson from its yuan mess two years ago?[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2106263/has-beijing-learnt-right-lesson-its-yuan-mess-two-years-ago]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A steady appreciation in the yuan against the dollar has also helped the Chinese government to defy allegations from the US President Donald Trump that China has been deliberately keeping the yuan cheap to gain unfair advantages in trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the yuan has gained nearly 6 per cent in 2017 against the greenback, it is mainly the result of dollar weakness, as the yuan has been weakening against the euro and even a trade-weighted basket of currencies this year, said Shen Jianguang, the chief economist of Mizuho Securities Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The central bank may soon start to worry about excessive appreciation in yuan against the dollar,” said Shen. “It would relax capital outflow controls.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When China embarked on a massive credit stimulus in late 2008, the job of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> became relatively easy: it just had to provide as much cheap credit as banks wanted in the interbank market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> faces a much trickier situation now. On the one hand, it must become less generous in giving funds to banks and needs to allow rates to rise so that financial risks won't worsen. On the other hand, it must be careful not to overdo its more parsimonious approach to avoid causing a money-market crunch or hurting on-the-ground economic activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s bit-by-bit tightening, often via nimble tweaks in the interbank market that are barely noticed by the general public, puts it close to a moment of truth on how far and fast it should continue going in the same direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Xiaohui, an assistant central bank governor, wrote in an article published this week that a slight drainage in liquidity by the central bank has already triggered loud complaints from a few financial institutions that have gotten used to an unlimited supply of credit. "They often use horrifying words such as…‘money crunch' or ‘market crash'" in pleading with the central bank to relax, Zhang wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> is constantly sending dovish signals to calm the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With China's financial tightening in full swing, risks needs be managed[http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2093689/chinas-financial-tightening-full-swing-risks-needs-be]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shortly after </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> downgraded China's sovereign rating last week, </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> told banks it will be generous in providing money in June. In response to worries that </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> may shrink its balance sheet, a sign of tightening, </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> said it's not certain that will happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is certain is that </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s ambiguity will be tested. Once the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raises the curtain on interest rate hikes and tightening, China has to follow suit or risk greater capital-outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the Fed hikes interest rates, </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> at some point has to stand closely enough to the US dollar," said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen. "In interest-rate terms, they cannot get too far apart.""We don't see the need to completely tighten monetary policy. The economy is still finding the bottom. Inflation is low. Authorities need to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy."Guan Tao, a former official with China's foreign exchange administration</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-year Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate has climbed to a two-year high and is now higher than the prime loan rate, or the interest banks charge to their best clients. Meanwhile, the central bank has kept its benchmark loan and deposit interest rates unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Steven Zhang, chief economist with Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, said China has no choice but to let interest rates rise as well, given the high stakes for Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Without proper response to the Fed rate hikes, capital outflows would threaten China's financial stability at a time when Beijing requires market stability to ensure a smooth power reshuffle around the [Communist] Party's 19th congress this fall," Zhang said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a rise in interest rates, together with enhanced regulation from China's financial regulators, could translate into tension within China's fragile financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If they do it too quickly, it would trigger a stampede out of the debt products ... so they seem to tap on the brake rather than slam on the brake," said Balding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guan Tao, a former official with the country's foreign exchange administration who is now a researcher with a Beijing-based private think tank, said domestic factors will determine China's stance on monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We don't see the need to completely tighten monetary policy," Guan said. "The economy is still finding the bottom. Inflation is low. Authorities need to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors in China and around the world may soon have to reassess the rate-hike path taken by the US Federal reserve, the central bank for the world's largest economy, Hong Hao, chief strategist of Bocom International, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think some traders are over-relaxed regarding the rate hike outlook," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said investors had priced in an only one-time interest rate hike by the Fed for this year and cited the performance of US treasuries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US economy is on a solid course with hints of inflation and the bank is headed towards further interest rate increases, chairwoman Janet Yellen[http://www.federalreservehistory.org/People/DetailView/56] said on Thursday in a rare gathering with her predecessors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US economy has continued to progress in a satisfactory way," Yellen told the International House, a New York-based non-profit residence for students. "We continue to see good job performance, some evidence of inflation moving up. So that was our expectation when we raised rates in December."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is the first time that Yellen and former </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> chairmen Ben Bernanke and Paul Volcker appeared together, financial news television channel CNBC reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, who headed the US central bank from 1987 to 2006, appeared by video link from Washington.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Yes. There is accommodation in the monetary policy that we have. But we think the gradual path of rate increases will be appropriate," Yellen said. "We remain on a reasonable path and I don't think December was a mistake."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also rebutted a recent statement from US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump about that country's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I hope I'm wrong, but I think we're in a big, fat, juicy bubble," Trump told CNBC's Power Lunch programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US "is not a bubble economy," Yellen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of last year the Federal Open Market Committee unanimously voted to set the new target range for the federal funds rate at 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent, up from zero to 0.25 per cent. It was the first rise in US interest rates in nine years.I think some traders are over-relaxed regarding the rate hike outlookHong Hao, chief strategist of Bocom International</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose in March, the first monthly gain since November. Analysts said that was partly due to favourable currency valuation effects after the euro and yen strengthened against the US dollar that month. Pressure for a weaker yuan and further capital outflow remained.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment bank </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> raised its expectation for Macau revenue growth in 2017 on new casino openings and better infrastructure, but warned of risks from further Chinese government crackdowns on graft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gross gaming revenue growth(GGR) has been raised to 10 per cent in 2017 from its previous estimate of 2 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> 's latest report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe the Macau cycle has turned and 2017 could show 10 per cent GGR and 13 per cent ebitda growth, the first in four years," said </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> equity analysts including Praveen Choudhary and Alex Poon. "And we see both mass and VIP growth tracking better than expected."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opening of Wynn Palace and Sands China is expected to continue driving revenue growth and ebitda in the first half of 2017, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wynn Palace and the Parisian Macau opened in August and September 2016 respectively. In August, gaming revenue in Macau saw positive growth for the first time in over two years, following 26 consecutive months of decline. In November, the revenue rose 14.4 per cent to 18.8 billion Macau patacas. It was the fourth straight month of year on year revenue growth and the first double-digit growth in 31 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts said the VIP segment fluctuates with China's property performance and liquidity conditions but they expect mass market revenue can sustain high single-digit growth in the medium term driven by improved infrastructure and increased spending per visitor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Infrastructure improvements in Macau will be seen in coming years. The Taipa Ferry Terminal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017, while the Guangzhou Rail Link extension to Hengqin and Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge are expected in 2018, and Macau light rail in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These infrastructure improvement will drive higher visitation and potentially higher spending per capita," the </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts said.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A similar infrastructure enabled boost was seen in Guangdong province in 2010 and 2011, when domestic tourism revenue growth spiked to 24 per cent and 27 per cent respectively after the opening of the Wuhan to Guangzhou high speed train link which cut travel time from 11 hours to 3 hours.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of Chinese visitors to Macau grew by 20 per cent and 22 per cent respectively over the same period, outpacing growth of non-Chinese visitors to Macau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said although positive estimate revisions could continue in the near term, there are also risks in the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe the Chinese government will continue to monitor capital outflows and tighten when necessary," said Choudhary. The fall in China's foreign exchange reserves accelerated in November, shrinking by US$69.1 billion to US$ 3.052 trillion, the largest monthly drop since January, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Meaningful depreciation in Chinese yuan against the US dollar could hamper Macau spending per capita, affecting both VIP and premium mass [markets], and also triggering more capital outflow control measures," the analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other possible negative factors include smoking bans and intensified anti-graft measures, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> expects the yuan to depreciate 5 per cent in 2017 and 2 per cent in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank is more bullish on </span><span class="s3">Galaxy Entertainment Group</span><span class="s1"> due to its more attractive valuation, differentiated productand enhanced yield.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wynn Macau</span><span class="s1"> is also recommenced by </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> . "We believe the combination of about 30 per cent forecast ebitda growth in 2017 and 4.5 per cent dividend yield for full year 2016 will drive </span><span class="s3">Wynn Macau</span><span class="s1"> to outperform in 2017," the analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese carmaker </span><span class="s3">Zhejiang Geely Holding Group</span><span class="s1"> saw its shares surge more than 10 per cent in Hong Kong afternoon trading on Tuesday after the company increased its stake in Denmark' </span><span class="s3">Saxo Bank</span><span class="s1"> to above 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the company, one of China's largest carmakers, jumped 12.3 per cent in afternoon trading in Hong Kong to HK$24.70 from HK$22 last Friday, after Reuters reported that the company had lifted its stake to 51.5 per cent in Denmark's </span><span class="s3">Saxo Bank</span><span class="s1"> at a cost of US$300 million for the additional 21.5 per cent.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, the company's ambitious new energy vehicle plan should benefit from the long-term development of new energy vehicles s in China, said the investment bank.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said the total sales volume for the month of August was 96,505 units, an increase of approximately 80 per cent over the same period last year and up around 6 per cent from July 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Geely spokes person said the deal with </span><span class="s3">Saxo Bank</span><span class="s1"> was an "attractive investment", believing the technologies and product value of the Danish bank could be expanded in Asia, according to the report.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China must continue to take steps to attract foreign funds and investors to its stock market, according to a senior official with the industry watchdog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fang Xinghai, a vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the financial sector and its capital market, which are largely shielded by a closed capital account, were not connected with the rest of the world, broadcaster China Business Network reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Foreign investment accounts for just 2 per cent of the total value of the A-share market … so we need to open it up further,” he was quoted as saying.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weighting of China's A-shares [mainland traded stocks] within the MSCI Emerging Market Index, a global benchmark, was just 5 per cent, Fang said, adding that Beijing was trying to increase that figure to 15 or 20 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments came as Beijing is working hard to attract foreign banks and financial investment to counter growing capital outflow pressures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the fall continues this week, the market could lose its status as the world's second largest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fang said Beijing was trying to give foreign investors more opportunities to manage risk, through index futures and other derivatives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Risk management and control is the eternal theme during the process of opening up. Many developing counties have found that during the opening up of their financial markets, there was a lack of supervision, resulting in bubbles and overvaluation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For China, I think the most important thing in preventing financial risks is to prevent asset bubbles while remaining open [to foreign investors].”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Shanghai's free-trade zone, which Beijing regards as a leader in market liberalisation, last week issued 25 new preferential policies for foreign financial institutions, including allowing them to establish branches and subsidiaries simultaneously, and increase their stakes in joint ventures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China will step up its crackdown on foreign currency crimes, including underground banking, to safeguard “national economic and financial security”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said on Monday that it worked with police to raid roughly 100 underground banks involving “hundreds of billions of yuan” and arrested more than 100 suspects last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year the foreign currency regulator would wage the campaign with “even greater enthusiasm” to punish operators and clients of underground banks helping Chinese move their money overseas. It would also clamp down on illegal activities under the guise of “innovation”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement suggests that there is unlikely to be any relaxation in China's draconian capital account controls, even though the yuan has strengthened to a two-year high against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From January 1, account holders can withdraw a maximum of 100,000 yuan (US$15,000) a year in total overseas from their Chinese bank accounts, rather than the previous 100,000 yuan allowable from each account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, each person can change up to US$50,000 in foreign currencies a year, with any amount beyond that requiring special permission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government also bans mainland residents from buying overseas securities or properties directly apart from via designated channels such as the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock link, forcing many residents to turn to money brokers, or underground banks, to send funds abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Underground banks facilitated an exodus of cash from 2014 to 2016, with China shedding about US$1 trillion in its foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The administration said it and the police would track money flows in illegal deals to uproot “criminal networks” and use both “criminal” penalties such as imprisonment, and “administrative ones” such as fines, to punish those who dared to flout Beijing's capital account controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese leadership has made preventing financial risk a top priority for the next three years. Capital outflow had been regarded as a major threat but a series of tighter capital controls, coupled with a weakening US dollar, halted the exodus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, China's forex reserves climbed for the 11th straight month to US$3.14 trillion, the highest level in more than a year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Concerns about Hong Kong developers losing market share to their Chinese peers are fading as mainland companies have pulled back from their breakneck expansion in the city, according to a report from S&amp;P Global Ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mainland developers took up nearly half of the land tenders during the financial years of 2015 and 2016, but their share has dropped to only 11 per cent in the current financial year,” because of the effects of Chinese capital controls and tighter scrutiny on overseas investments, said Esther Liu, who led the research on the latest report released by the ratings agency on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu also highlighted that the longer project cycle length in Hong Kong had increased capital costs and added pressure to the balance sheet of the mainland developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is typical for major local developers like </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1"> to take two to three years for developing a new project. But mainland developers such as Country Garden and Vanke were used to developing projects in a shorter time span on the mainland, from land acquisition to presale,[sometimes] as short as six to nine months only,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese developers also needed more time to gain experience managing pre-project work in Hong Kong such as project orientation and design.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also warned that the rise in property prices may not fully offset the land costs for the developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese conglomerate </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> spent HK$27.2 billion (US$3.5 billion) on four land plots at Hong Kong's former airport site in Kai Tak over four months since November 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HNA Group pays HK$7.44b for fourth plot of land at former site of Hong Kong airport[http://www.scmp.com/property/article/2079140/hna-group-pays-hk744-billion-fourth-plot-land-kai-tak]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese developers have kept land costs buoyant in Hong Kong, compressing margins for all. This is likely to kick in when developers start to do projects acquired in the past three years,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other analysts were not surprised by the findings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese developers had no land bank in Hong Kong so they built their land reserves aggressively a few years ago,” said Thomas Lam, head of valuation and consultancy at Knight Frank. “Now, they have projects in the pipeline together with the capital outflow restriction. I expect that they will continue to purchase land in Hong Kong but a selective and strategic approach will be adopted.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Government land tender is only one of the options in obtaining land,” Lam said. “Mainland developers may also go for redevelopment projects in urban land or purchase a site or project from other developers.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vincent Cheung, deputy managing director for Asia valuation and advisory services at </span><span class="s3">Colliers International</span><span class="s1"> said that President Xi Jinping's statement that homes are meant for living and not speculation may have also influenced mainland developers' decisions in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's policy influence on Chinese developers has given local developers breathing space,” he said. “And they have grasped the opportunity to rebuild their land bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The fact that local developers keep pushing the land price up means they expect the housing market to remain positive in the long run,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has ramped up measures to enable funds to flow back within its borders, in what analysts say is an attempt to combat capital flight and the downward pressure on the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore loans secured by domestic guarantee can be repatriated to China to facilitate domestic companies' cross-border financing and investment, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement posted on its website[http://www.safe.gov.cn/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gPZxdnX293QwML7zALA09P02Bnr1BvI2c_E_1wkA6zeGd3Rw8Tcx8DAwsTdwMDTxMnfz8P50BDA09jiLwBDuBooO_nkZ-bql-QnZ3m6KioCACk6Xh-/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfSENEQ01LRzEwODRJQzBJSUpRRUpKSDEySTI!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/safe_web_store/safe_web/zcfg/zhfg/qt/node_zcfg_qt_store/06ad61004fd6d8b2b8d6b88c78fc6d27] on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new steps, posted on the last working day ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday on the mainland, reflect Beijing's efforts to better balance capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore loans secured by domestic guarantee have been used in the past to encourage domestic companies to invest offshore. Allowing the capital to be repatriated means Beijing is encouraging the flow the other way around, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The nation's forex regulator also granted more leeway for multinational companies to make use of offshore foreign exchange for onshore use. Multinationals are allowed to tap 100 per cent of the offshore foreign currency deposits for domestic operation, up from a cap of 50 per cent previously.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The foreign exchange regulator also clarified that domestic companies have to make up for their previous losses before they can transfer the current year's profits offshore, adding figures than US$50,000 must be vetted with supporting documents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forex regulator said such measures aim to “deepen foreign exchange management reform, cut red tape, support the growth of real economy and facilitate trade and investment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ren Zhiyi, a partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Fangda Partners</span><span class="s1">, said the measures indicate policymakers are seeking to ramp up capital inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's not surprising to see more measures expanding capital inflow as Beijing is trying various means to attract more capital back home to counter mounting capital outflow amid expectations of a weaker yuan,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan lost nearly 7 per cent in 2016, or its biggest annual loss against the US dollar since 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has tightened its capital controls in the past year though it reiterated its unwavering support on “real and reasonable” overseas investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan ends 2016 with biggest annual loss since 1994[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2058260/yuan-ends-2016-biggest-annual-loss-1994]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outflow curbs include vetting on cross-border payments exceeding US$5 million meant for overseas investment purposes, enhanced scrutiny on large-scale overseas investment and limiting the amount of yuan that Chinese companies can remit outside the country through overseas lending, sources said earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said China's moves to tighten capital controls are seeing some success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Outflows last month were the smallest since August thanks to a sharp pull-back in outbound direct investment,” he said in a note. “Policymakers aren't out of the woods though: a period of further US dollar strength could trigger another rise in outflows.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He estimated that December outflows amounted to US$60 billion, down from US$74 billion in November.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese corporates fuelling an outbound buying spree need to be better prepared on foreign exchange controls as Beijing beefs up curbs on capital outflows to stop “fake” deals, participants told a forum in Shanghai on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies could find it more difficult and time consuming to complete all procedures required by forex authorities to transfer capital abroad for outbound merger and acquisition deals even after they received approvals from regulators like the Ministry of Commerce and the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1">, Eric Liu, a senior consultant of law firm Linklaters, told the China M&amp;A Forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If corporates are not fully prepared on the forex issue in advance, informing forex regulators at the earlier stage of deals, it could lead to a disastrous aftermath such as falling behind deal closing dates due to the inability to transfer money across the border in time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite these issues, market participants said they still believe Beijing's policy support on authentic outbound M&amp;A remains intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On the policy front we haven't seen fundamental changes,” Liu said. “Short term capital outflow worries did cast a shadow and will curb those fake deals seeking to move capital out of China for forex reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yang Lei, head of cross-border M&amp;A for Huatai United Securities, told the forum that Beijing's support for “good-quality deals” remains.On the policy front we haven't seen fundamental changesEric Liu, Linklaters</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While hedging against currency risk amid the ongoing yuan depreciation is one factor behind the outbound M&amp;As, the more important factor for businesses is “moving up the value chain and seeking synergy”, Lin Wei, a partner at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> said on the sidelines of the forum, which was co-hosted by Mergermarket and AVCJ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month Mergermarket said the momentum of outbound M&amp;A deals in the fourth quarter could slow down due to forex controls, pointing out that some proposed deals failed due to tighter and more time consuming forex procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mergermarket data showed that mainland Chinese and Hong Kong outbound M&amp;A deals in the first three quarters were valued at US$171.7 billion, up 163.4 per cent over the same period last year. That was in sharp contrast to the value of inbound deals that slumped 78.8 per cent year-on-year to US$6.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first eight months of 2016, the mainland's total outbound investment topped US$118.1 billion, up 53.5 per cent year on year, according to commerce ministry data. In the same period mainland companies invested in 5,929 companies in 158 countries and regions, the data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, mainland China became the world's second largest outbound investor after the United States with an outbound investment of US$145.67 billion, the 13th straight year of growth.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> has denied devaluing its currency to weather the trade war and sent a veiled warning to “forces trying to short the yuan” after it weakened to a 22-month low against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, said the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which he heads, had “accumulated rich experiences and developed multiple policy tools” in defending the yuan, after the offshore exchange rate weakened to 6.97 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As for those forces trying to short the yuan, we have engaged directly a few years ago and we know each other very well,” Pan told a press briefing in Beijing. “I think our memories should still be fresh.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pan did not name any individuals or institutions he believed were shorting - selling a currency, hoping for a decline in the market price - nor did he elaborate on how Beijing had “engaged directly with” such parties in the foreign exchange market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those betting on a weaker yuan exchange rate are often viewed as unwelcome or even hostile by the Chinese government, which regards the yuan exchange rate not as a normal price indicator but as a symbol of China's economic health that must be defended.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fund managers and traders betting on a plunge in the Chinese currency's value akin to those of Argentina's peso or the Turkish lira have been left disappointed as China has kept the exchange rate under its control via direct market intervention, capital account controls and tweaks of trading rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Chinese fundamentals such as excessive money printing and economic deceleration offer reasons to bet on a weaker yuan, the exchange rate against the dollar has never weakened beyond 7 yuan to the dollar in the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ongoing trade war with the United States has again fanned expectations that the yuan would weaken and that Beijing may tolerate a modest depreciation to offset tariffs, to help exporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has lost about 10 per cent against the US dollar since April. The US' </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve Board</span><span class="s1"> is raising rates, while </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> is leaning towards monetary easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Pan reiterated on Friday that Beijing had no plans to allow a sharp fall in the yuan, would not engage in “competitive devaluation” and would not use its currency as a weapon in the trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is a responsible big country,” Pan said. “We are not going to competitively devalue [the yuan], we will not use the exchange rate as a tool to respond to trade conflict and market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The central bank has reiterated this many times. Today I will reiterate again.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined to comment directly on yuan exchange levels but said the central bank had sufficient reserves to keep the exchange rate stable, adding that it still “reflects the supply and demand and movements in the international foreign exchange market”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pressures of capital outflow and yuan depreciation remain visible in China. According to data published by the exchange regulator yesterday, Chinese banks sold a net 110.3 billion yuan (US$15.9 billion) to companies and individuals in September, the highest since December 2016, in the latest sign that capital outflows are picking up amid weakness in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts at </span><span class="s3">Commerzbank</span><span class="s1"> wrote in a note published last week that 7 yuan to the dollar would be breached if China's trade conflict with the US lasts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When China suddenly devalued the yuan by 2 per cent in August 2015 during its stock market rout, it suffered a US$500 billion capital flight that year, raising fears of a Chinese financial meltdown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three years later, Pan said, the country's monetary authority was more experienced to keep a crisis at bay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">, said that despite high depreciation pressure, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was likely to keep the yuan stable ahead of the G20 leaders' annual summit next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US has made it clear a stable renminbi is a prerequisite [to settling the trade dispute],” said Liu, adding that there were only limited players shortening the yuan in the onshore market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan is set to record, after what has been a volatile trading year, its biggest annual drop in value since 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, as 2017 dawns experts generally agree the currency of the world's second largest economy is set to end the “6 era” - a period with an exchange rate between 6 and 7 against the US dollar - for the first time since April 2008, and enter a new “7 era”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2016 had started in dramatic fashion, with the offshore yuan tumbling nearly 600 basis points on January 4, and the currency is also set to end the year in similar mood.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday night, the onshore yuan broke the critical psychological level of 7 to the US dollar at 11pm, according to a price quoted by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The milestone scared a lot of people, including the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, which in an unusual move responded immediately, labelling the price quote “irresponsible”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figure eventually turned out to be mistake, but it did show just how easily the markets and the authorities can be spooked when the currency hovers close to 7 per US dollar, particularly after a extremely volatile period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is still inching closer to 7 per US dollar, quoted at 6.9493 and 6.9758 in the onshore and offshore markets, respectively, on Friday - the lowest levels in eight and a half years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's close to 7 per cent weaker against the greenback at the beginning of the year, marking the biggest annual loss since 1994, and down for the third year in a row.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The daily reference rate of the yuan set by the central bank was lowered by a total of 4,434 basis points, or 6.82 per cent to 6.9370 per US dollar on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has continued to depreciate since Donald Trump was unexpectedly elected the next President of the United States, which analysts say have increasing expectations of inflationary pressure due to the massive potential fiscal spending he promised during his campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> has since dropped its interest rates, with at least one further cut expected by the market next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That prospect has driven the US Dollar Index, which gauges the value of greenback, about 6 per cent higher since the election, following a 2 per cent rise in the three months prior to the vote.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the index fell to its weakest level in more than two weeks on Friday, many said they expected the strengthening trend to continue in 2017, which in turn will put further pressure on the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> has forecast the Chinese currency to keep falling against the greenback, tipping 7.2 yuan to the US dollar by the end of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank expects the weakness to be most severe in the first two quarters of the year, which may prompt mainlanders to make early use of their US$50,000 annual foreign exchange ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Bloomberg survey shows analysts' median forecast for the yuan is to end 2017 at 7.15 against the dollar, offering a 63 per cent chance of it hitting 7 by the end of the first quarter, which would be a four-fold increase in the probability offered three months ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan's discount to the onshore exchange rate, seen as a gauge of traders' bearishness on the currency, expanded to the most since December 13 on an intraday basis on Thursday, as traders sold the currency on bets of stronger depreciation pressures as the year draws to an end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency's ongoing bleak outlook has been forcing local individuals and businesses to reduce their exposure to yuan-denominated assets and rush into US dollar-denominated ones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves, meanwhile, shrank by around a quarter from US$3.99 trillion in June 2014 to US$3.05 trillion in November, and the country was displaced in October by Japan as America's top foreign creditor, as the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> spent more of its reserves to defend the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The steady decline in foreign exchange reserves prompted Yu Yongding, a former advisor to the PBOC, to suggest that once reserves fall below a certain psychological threshold, capital outflows are almost certainly to accelerate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu said China has from now until president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration to steady the foreign exchange market, and allow the yuan to depreciate to a fair and more natural level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank, however, seems wary of triggering any further strong depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday changed the way it will calculate a key yuan index in the new year, nearly doubling the number of foreign currencies in a basket that is used to set the currency's value to 24, from 13. The weighting of the US dollar within that basket will be lowered to 22.43 per cent from the current 26.43 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the change was in line with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s hope of discouraging investors from exclusively tracking its fluctuations, but added that it would have limited impact on the Chinese currency, which they still expect to weaken further against the dollar next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This means the central bank will pay more attention to the RMB's stability against a basket of currencies,” analysts at CEBM Group said in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities have rolled out policies over the past two months to tighten its grip on capital outflows, including restricting mainlanders' purchase of insurance and investment products in Hong Kong, which were considered an increasingly popular channel for capital outflow. It has also imposed restrictions on Chinese companies' remittances overseas.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After declining for three consecutive days following Beijing's shock devaluation, the yuan strengthened on Friday following soothing words from </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> that suggested the authorities are not planning any further devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A day after </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> deputy governor Yi Gang said the authorities would act "when the market's volatility is excessive", the central bank raised the yuan's reference rate for the first time since Tuesday's devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan (CNY) gained 0.11 per cent, or 70 basis points, to finish the week at 6.3912 against the US dollar, while offshore yuan strengthened 0.4 per cent, or 260 basis points, to 6.4378.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing this week introduced a new market-driven currency mechanism in which the daily reference point - the midpoint of the yuan's exchange rate with the dollar from which it can rise or fall 2 per cent - is based on the previous day's close, That has led onshore yuan to lose 2.9 per cent, or 1,815 basis points, over the past week. Offshore yuan has lost 3.6 per cent, or 2,248 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some regional currencies also fell this week, triggering concerns about a fresh currency war in Asia. Since Tuesday, both the Singapore dollar and the South Korean won have lost 1.5 per cent, the Taiwan dollar is down 1.6 per cent while the Australian dollar has lost 0.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some fund managers and analysts believe although there could be downward pressure on the exchange rate this year, a sharp depreciation is unlikely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While a big [10 per cent] CNY devaluation is not justified, the central bank is now putting greater emphasis on the CNY's trade-weighted value, and a combination of factors argue for a drop of 'around 3 per cent'. This adjustment may be close to complete, by our estimates," said Eddie Cheung, an analyst at </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Why would the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> allow the currency to depreciate further to risk triggering capital outflows? We expect [the yuan] to reach its new equilibrium at around 6.40 to 6.50 to the dollar," BlackRock fund manager Tan Suanjin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the general outlook that the worst is over and there is limited downside for the currency, yuan-denominated products are under pressure to raise returns in order to retain customers. Dim sum bonds have seen yields surge as investors demand higher compensation in the wake of the yuan's sharp depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore commercial banks are kicking off another cycle of raising yuan deposit rates to retain liquidity, underscoring outflow pressure from Hong Kong's yuan deposit pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, Hong Kong's secretary for financial services and the treasury, said on Friday the scenario of some capital outflow from the city as a result of the devaluation should not be discounted and that Hong Kong was ready to handle such a situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although CNH (offshore yuan) will likely stay volatile for a while, CNH deposits still generate a good carry yield of around 3 per cent," </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analyst Heng Koonhow said. "So I would expect CNH deposits to gradually grow over the longer run ... only when there is good liquidity and a deep offshore pool of investable CNH assets, can the convergence in CNH and CNY be done more efficiently."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When mainland conglomerates look abroad for investment opportunities, the temptation of trophy assets can be irresistible. But the long-term investment can be problematical. A salutary lesson is to be drawn from the experience of Japan decades ago after a corporate shopping spree for overseas property and leisure assets led to capital outflows that caused problems for its economy. China has reached a tipping point in a corporate go-global splurge once encouraged by Beijing, but now prompting it to ban or restrict investments in leisure and property assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worries about the scale of capital outflows, particularly in property, have been compounded by companies borrowing at home to buy overpriced overseas assets, with implications for the stability of the mainland banking system in the event of market fluctuations. As a result, Beijing has intervened to order checks on credit exposure and shift the emphasis to investment in hi-tech, research, logistics and infrastructure projects linked to the "Belt and Road Initiative" - the state's preferred go-global strategy. Just this week, developer Dalian Wanda Group backed away from a £470 million (HK$4.7 billion) acquisition of a London development site. It remains to be seen whether encouragement to invest at home in state-owned enterprises is effective in reforming them as well as reining in the biggest firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas real estate and soccer clubs in crosshairs as China ramps up investment clampdown[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2107392/overseas-hotels-and-soccer-clubs-crosshairs-china-ramps]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retreat in outbound property investment could create headwinds for prices in Hong Kong, especially for office assets. However, that reckons without the ability of mainland firms to boost overseas currency assets by issuing debt or equity abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, analysts say the new outbound investment rules could bring benefits to Hong Kong, such as lower land prices and financial support for technology and infrastructure. Officials say the city is well placed to support the "Belt and Road Initiative", through technology, trade and commerce, logistics and financial services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coming after the Beidaihe summit of party leaders and ahead of a leadership reshuffle at the 19th Communist Party congress later this year, the redirection of outbound investment sends important policy signals. The latest controls on capital outflow reflect determination to put the economy back on track and curtail irrational overseas investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It reinforces President Xi Jinping's concern that financial stability is crucial to national security. At this pivotal time in the globalisation of the Chinese economy, overseas investments by mainland companies should be positive for the country's economy. This is a timely reminder. It gives the economy better direction that is also good for Hong Kong, especially in terms of a rational property market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stocks in industry leaders on the mainland A-share market have surged by 57 per cent in the first 11 months this year, and this rally is likely to continue in 2018 as market consolidation goes on, said analysts at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have picked the biggest caps in each of the 28 industries categorised by data provider Wind for a study, and found that they rose by about 57 per cent on average year to day, largely outperforming the benchmark," said Chen Li, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">'s China strategist, in a forum in Shenzhen on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rally is likely to continue into 2018, although I would prefer leaders in the segment markets rather than the big first-tier names in big industries," he said, adding that as China continues to push for supply-side reform, which favours bigger industry players while forcing smaller ones out, the big caps will continue to enjoy a rising market share and better business returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has this year gained around 8.6 per cent - by Friday's close it was at 3371.7 - while industry leaders have been rising at a faster pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kweichow Moutai, China's biggest distiller, saw its share price rocket up to 639.2 yuan (US$96.4), up by 91 per cent from 334 yuan in 2016, becoming the most eye-catching blue chip in Shanghai this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mutual funds' weighting of ChiNext, the Shenzhen-based listing of smaller tech companies, has continued the fall since the beginning of this year due to low market risk appetite, tight market liquidity and ChiNext's earnings growth slowing down, Gao Ting, the head of China Strategy at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> wrote in a note on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"During the third quarter, mutual fund investors in the A-share market have been outweighing in beverage, non-ferrous metals and electronics, followed by property developers, banks and insurers …</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We continue to see upside potential for banks. We prefer large banks with adequate capital and low balance-sheet risk, which may benefit from a better non-performing loan ratio," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with the A-share market, the Hong Kong equity market has been undergoing a bigger rally, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index rising by 30 per cent to 28603.6 by Friday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Caixin on Wednesday quoted a source close to the State Council as saying that Beijing was considering picking two companies for a pilot and making their non-tradeable shares free-floating, a move that will make the so-call H-share companies - incorporated on the mainland but listed on the offshore Hong Kong market - more liquid.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this will have a limited impact on Hong Kong's secondary market due to its size, and will largely boost the financing ability of the H-share companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, there are 225 H-share companies on the main board. Some of these also have a listed unit on the mainland, making them "unlikely to sell shares in Hong Kong due to the significant A/H premium", analysts with BofA Merrill Lynch wrote in a note on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If all H shares were to become tradeable after the trial, we estimate that owners of less than US$122 billion worth of H shares may be tempted to sell at some point. Although this may put pressure on certain stocks, overall market impact should be limited given the relatively small scale. The move should add to the Hong Kong market's attraction as an IPO destination for mainland companies,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">thus a small positive for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A similar message has been sent out a few times, said Nicole Yuen, the head of North Asia equities at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, while "capital outflow would remain a key concern for regulators if they are really going to push it out".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The full convertibility of pre-IPO shares allows founders or major shareholders of mainland companies to float their shares on the Hong Kong bourse, where non-Chinese investors can trade in them without being qualified investors on the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would test the country's management of capital flow, as the selling of shares on the offshore market will convert equities into offshore capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">'s Li, however, said selling of shares may not be the only option for major holders of H-share listed mainland companies, if they want to raise money.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overnight borrowing cost of offshore yuan in Hong Kong's interbank market has been set at its highest rate in almost a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for offshore yuan, known as the CNH Hibor, was fixed by the Treasury Markets Association (TMA) at 38.33 per cent on Thursday, the highest level since January 13, 2016. That's more than double the 16.95 per cent fix on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overnight, the offshore yuan surged the most in a year as traders scrambled to square their short positions, while the Chinese central government continues to tighten measures to control capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Chinese policy makers were likely to order state-owned enterprises to sell foreign currency for yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, said the tightening of liquidity in offshore yuan is likely to be the result of "an intervention by </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> played the same trick last January and September -- by suddenly draining the offshore yuan market, it immediately pushed up yuan's borrowing costs and hit the speculators," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan bears usually borrow the currency in the offshore market to build their short positions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the liquidity drain in Hong Kong will not sustain for long," Yao said, adding that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would not want to kill the offshore market, but would use the tactic as a way to deter speculators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overnight, the offshore yuan soared 1.3 per cent or 930 basis points to hit 6.866 per dollar, breaching several psychologically important levels. The change marked its biggest percentage gain in about a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It continued to strengthen fast on Thursday and had broken the 6.8 level to stand at 6.7870 by 2.42pm, while onshore yuan was trading at 6.8729 against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Policy makers in Beijing have recently introduced a slew of measures to tighten control of the currency market, including placing higher scrutiny on citizens' conversion quotas and stricter requirements for banks reporting cross-border transactions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's insurance sector is likely to come under increased pressure after Beijing tightened its scrutiny of individual foreign currency purchases at the start of the new year in a bid to further restrict capital outflows, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's insurance companies were already feeling the pinch from a raft of earlier measures designed to make it harder for mainlanders to purchase insurance products as a way of hedging against the declining yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of January 1, 2017, individuals are required to explain the purpose of their foreign currency purchases at Chinese banks and provide additional information, according to a recent announcement by the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), the country's top currency regulator.We expect more material impact on the business Chinese tourists bring to Hong Kong insurersJenny Jiang, analyst, Morgan Stanley</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Specifically, individuals are restricted from using foreign currencies in overseas investments, including property, securities, life insurance products and investment-related insurance purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect Hong Kong's insurance industry to feel the effects of the latest measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We expect more material impact on the business Chinese tourists bring to Hong Kong insurers, given the fresh restrictions on outbound personal investments," said Jenny Jiang, an equity analyst for Morgan Stanley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The new rules for 2017 not only make US dollars less accessible to individuals but also effectively prevent customers from using the onshore banking system to pay for cross-border insurance premiums."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the rules, the annual cap of US$50,000 for each person seeking to sell yuan remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the process has become more restrictive and complicated, said analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although there are still other ways of making the insurance payment, this move could dampen interest in and demand for Hong Kong insurance policies to a certain extent, as customers may see the</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">transaction as too risky and too complicated, " Jiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, it could make renewal payment more difficult and lead to surrenders in extreme cases, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts from </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> said the latest measures were "a clear reaction" to the yuan's recent weakness and the government's mounting concern about capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurance stocks hammered as China tries to slow capital outflows through Hong Kong insurance purchases[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2041560/insurance-stocks-hammered-china-tries-slow-capital-outflows]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, the authorities are worried that there will be a rush to buy foreign currencies in the early months of 2017, as Chinese people try to use their US$50,000 quota for the year before the yuan weakens further or additional tightening measures are introduced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be some sectors which could face a more fundamental impact on their business under this new measure, most notably insurance companies that rely heavily on business from mainland customers as well as Macau gaming operations," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analysts expect the government to introduce more capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Indeed, the current measure is only a relative measure, as the level of the individual quota has not been removed. Therefore, if the RMB continues to weaken, whether this measure will be really effective in containing capital outflow remains doubtful. In this case, one should not be surprised if more capital account control measures follow," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Share prices of Hong Kong-based insurers have been under pressure since last year, as China gradually tightened capital controls to stabilise the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors have poured into Hong Kong's insurance sector in recent years as they try to skirt strict capital controls to move money offshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, the Chinese authorities banned UnionPay cardholders from buying investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong and launched a probe into illegal sales of overseas insurance policies on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, the largest life insurer in the city, has slid 20 per cent from its peak in October. It fell 0.5 per cent to close at HK$43.55 on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The uncertainty facing the Chinese tourist business has been a key overhang on AIA's share price since last year as China gradually tightens capital controls to stabilize its currency," Jiang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, she said the policy risk has been "largely reflected" in AIA's current share price and the company's fundamentals still look attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jiang still put an "overweight" rating on the stock, but cited downside risks such as potential regulatory changes, particularly in relation to capital and consumer protection.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said on Thursday the first interest rate increase by the city in almost a decade will lead to some of the US$130 billion in hot money flowing out of the territory and boost the cost for homeowners here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said the city's central bank does not intend to relax any of the tough mortgage measures imposed by the authority in the past few years that were aimed at cooling down the sizzling property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The interest rate rise will add cost for the homeowners to repay their mortgage loans. It would have an impact on the property market. However, we have not yet seen any sign the property market is on a downtrend cycle. As such, we have no plans to relax the mortgage policies that were aimed at safeguarding the risks face by banks," he said in a media briefing on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA early on Thursday raised the base rate by 25 basis points from 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent, the first official rate rise in the city in almost a decade, matching the decision of the US Fed to also increase interest rates for the first time since 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the arrangement in which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, HKMA will change its official rate alongside any interest rate movement in the US. The base rate is the discount window rate charged to commercial banks to get funding from the HKMA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have a very prolonged period of a low interest environment and the monetary easing policy in the US has led to US$130 billion in inflows to the city over the past few years. Since the US has started to normalise its interest rate cycle, some of the money will leave but the pace will depend on the speed of the US interest rate rise next year. If the rate rise is slow and gradual, the capital outflow from Hong Kong would not happen too soon," Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While an outflow may hurt the local stock and property market, Chan believes Hong Kong could absorb the shock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong banking sector is liquid. As long as the public would carefully prepare for the interest rate rise, we should be able to cope. We have enjoyed a low interest rate for too long and it will take time for us to accept interest rate to go to a normal level," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A low interest rate may lead the assets into becoming too hot...so an interest rate rise would help the property market to have healthy development for a longer term," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the HKMA has no intention to change the peg to the US dollar even though it means the city could not independently determine its interest rate policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The peg has served Hong Kong well as a small economy. The HKMA has no intention to change the peg," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the HKMA will defend the peg when the Hong Kong dollar weakens to the 7.85 to the US dollar level. The last time the authority need to prevent the dollar from falling through this level was 10 years ago. The Hong Kong dollar is currently trading near the top end of the peg at 7.75.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commercial banks could decide if they want to increase the interest rate for their deposits or loan rates immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The last cut in Hong Kong's base rate took place on December 17, 2008 from 1.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent, and the last hike in base rate took place on June 30, 2006 from 6.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holding the world's biggest foreign reserves, an enormous domestic market fuelled by sharply rising consumption demand, Beijing has a huge say when to open its capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the pace for further movements will still be subject to how the global financial markets rebalance, especially after the US Fed announced on Wednesday its first rate hike in almost a decade, analysts said. The Fed decided to raise rates by 25 basis points overnight in its first rate increase since 2006, while its statement indicated gradual increases will come along as the US economy strengthens further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As you can tell from the process of China joining the SDR, China is highly competent in sticking to its own agenda when engaging in the global market, compared to decades ago when it applied for membership in the </span><span class="s3">WTO</span><span class="s1">," said Li-Gang Liu, China economist at Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SDR, or the Special Drawing Rights, refers to the reserve currency basket under the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> on November 30 agreed to add the Chinese currency yuan to this basket, after it judged the yuan as "freely usable", a criteria China failed to reach during its first application in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a contentious evaluation, and analysts argue about whether yuan is qualified for membership, given the currency is neither fully convertible, nor free floating. It was also the first change in the SDR since 1999, when the euro replaced the deutsche mark and French franc.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In comparison, it took 16 years for China to become the 143rd member of the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organization</span><span class="s1"> in 2001. To facilitate the negotiation, Beijing assented to accept a China-specific safeguard, effective until 2013, allowing other members to take action against any import from China that caused market disruption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would not doubt policy makers' willingness to enhance renminbi's convertibility and opening up more capital account items," said Helen Qiao, greater China chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, considering the market reactions, especially after the central bank adjusted the exchange rate mechanism on August 11, and the general instability of the global financial markets with the anxiety due to Fed's rate hike, this whole process could potentially drag, and the capital account liberalisation process may also be pushed back in 2016, she noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the view the US Fed was going to increase rates earlier in the year, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> devalued the yuan by almost 2 per cent on August 11 by raising the official mid price, which took the market by surprise, and Beijing later explained the move as a way to relax controls on the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move was also largely taken by analysts as an official recognition of the yuan devaluation, as the US dollar picked up strong momentum afterward.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign-exchange reserves declined last month to its lowest level since February 2013 amid heavy capital outflows, and as the central bank sold dollars to prevent a further steep drop in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency hoard dropped by US$87.2 billion to US$3.44 trillion at the end of November, from US$3.53 trillion a month earlier, according to </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> data released in early December. The total decline this year has already hit US$405 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his speech in Washington in an </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> meeting this April, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan pledged to launch two schemes in 2015 that would free currently inconvertible items under the capital account - one is QDII 2, which allows cross-border investment by individuals; the other is the Shenzhen -- Hong Kong stock connect, which enables international investors to trade in the domestic stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But neither of the two schemes has started at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yimin, an economist with Shenwan Hongyuan Securities based in Beijing, said the major drags lie in internal and external "uncertainties".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The authorities' concerns are that the Shenzhen connect may be embarrassed by low participation, particularly after the stock market rout in summer. As for QDII2, they might be waiting for a better launching time, to buffer the capital outflow pressure triggered by the Fed's rate hike."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Once things get stabilised. The schemes will be kicked off quickly," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital markets will be "much more accessible" by the year 2020, as the commitment to further open up capital accounts is irreversible after China joined the SDR, said Liu of ANZ</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This July, China had opened its US$5.7 trillion interbank bond market to foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said China should consider introducing more long-term funds to the market, for instance, allowing the US$36 trillion worth of global pension funds access to the bond market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing wants to make the yuan an "international currency" by 2020, and further loosen the management over foreign exchange to facilitate cross-border capital movement for individuals and companies, according to an article written by Governor Zhou in the People's Daily in late November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China's longest-serving central bank chief who has been sitting on the chair since 2002, Zhou is one of the most powerful names in the pro-reform camp and closely connected to the party's core decision making body.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The target to "gradually realise the convertibility of yuan" was also highlighted in the 13th five-year plan proposal, issued in late October after top party leaders sketched out the blueprint for China's next five-year development plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The year 2020 will be crucial as China is due to completes it 13th five-year plan by then, and celebrate the 100th founding anniversary for the ruling Communist Party in the next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it is worth noting that the concept of capital account convertibility held by the Chinese leadership is distinct from others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his speech in Washington this April, Zhou said the capital account convertibility China has targeted "is not based on the traditional concept of being fully or freely convertible".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, drawing lessons from the global financial crisis, China will adopt a concept of "managed convertibility", by using "macroprudential measures" to limit risks from cross-border capital flows and to maintain the stable value of the currency and a safe financial environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"On the global stage, I do not think it is too challenging for China to retain its own agenda. The bigger problem comes from internal - it is much harder to break the deadlocks in the domestic system, particularly when it hurts the interest groups," said Liu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Stock Exchange gained 1.5 per cent in the morning trading session after Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen's widely-expected decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> set the daily yuan mid-price weaker for the ninth day running at 6.4757 against the US dollar before the yuan weakened further in the morning trading session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost everyone has been expecting the Fed to act and China's stock investors have been factoring this in for a long time as well," said Luo Yi, the chief analyst at Huatai Securities. "When it happened, it's quite natural to see China's stock prices rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's nothing to be feared. In the last rate hike cycle of the Fed, the Hong Kong stock market continued to boom - it's not necessarily right to say that a Fed rate hike will be a curse for emerging markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> entered its rate hike cycle in 2004, China was the world's No.6 economy, its financial market was largely closed to the outside world and Beijing could be fairly relaxed about the Fed's decisions. China has lost that luxury today, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the last Fed rate cycle, China was still in the back seat, watching the Fed move from afar and probably wondering how central banking works, but now China is in the forefront," said Sun Lijian, a finance professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. "It has to face possible results from any major move in the outside world - that's a new territory for China's policy makers."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun said China, now the world's second biggest economy, was much more exposed to global capital flow risks, despite its capital controls.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaignIt's not necessarily right to say that a Fed rate hike will be a curse for emerging marketsLuo Yi, financial analyst</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the Fed first mouthed the word "tapering" in 2013, it partly triggered a cash crunch in the onshore interbank with the overnight rate soaring to 13.4 per cent; then there was a stock market crash and yuan exchange rate turbulence - both linked to money flows and market expectations influenced by the Fed move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed in June cited financial market volatility in emerging markets and China's economic slowdown as reasons for not raising interest rates that month. Since then China has arrested people blamed for contributing to a stock market crash, allowed the yuan to fall to the lowest level in four years versus the dollar and announced again that the yuan will de-peg the dollar to follow a basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts at </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1"> led by Jiang Chao wrote in a research note that the Fed's rate decision marked "an official turning point of global liquidity" and would add to depreciation pressure on the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fed's rate hike would "add pressure of capital outflow and yuan depreciation for China" and narrow the room for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to lower interest rates, they wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, China has to cut required reserve ratio to offset capital outflows. "We must deal with it from various fronts, first of all, we have to stabilise the domestic economy," the analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dollar traded near its weakest level in 17 months, reflecting an increasingly nervous market ahead of the upcoming </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> policy meeting and expectations that the timing of a rate rise in the city may be brought forward.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The currency fell as low as 7.7985 per dollar on Tuesday, its weakest level since January 2016 and down from an intra-day level of 7.8004 on Monday. Under the linked exchange rate system, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), the city's de facto central bank, is obliged to buy and sell US dollars to prevent the currency from breaching either side of a trading band between 7.75 and 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Markets are pricing in a 25 basis points increase in the US Fed Fund target rate to 1.25 per cent on Wednesday that would be the fourth rate rise since December 2015. The HKMA has increased its base rate three times since 2015, in lock step with the Fed to maintain the currency's peg with the US dollar.Hong Kong commercial banks will need to raise mortgage rates this time after the Fed's rate hike if they want to avoid greater pressure on the currencyJasper Lo, chief strategist, King International Financial</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong's dollar has weakened this year because commercial banks in the city have been keeping their prime rate at 5 per cent, reluctant to raise their bank rates. As the US dollar interest rate has climbed while the city's bank rates remained low, the widening interest rate differential has led to selling of Hong Kong dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has unveiled eight rounds of property tightening measures since 2014 but housing affordability remains one of the gravest issues facing the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four major Hong Kong banks including </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> raised their Hibor-linked mortgage rate in May but lenders still have little room to increase mortgage rates because of intense competition in the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consequently, the Hong Kong dollar is likely to remain under pressure, which may cause a clean break from the 7.80 level, according to Jasper Lo, chief strategist at King International Financial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Historically, the HKMA would buy Hong Kong dollars when the currency fell to 7.83, rather than waiting for it reach the 7.85 lower limit of the trading band.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there is no threat to the Hong Kong dollar peg arrangement for the forseeable future because foreign reserves stand at US$396 billion, such action by the HKMA would probably shrink those reserves as well as domestic money supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong commercial banks will need to raise mortgage rates this time after the Fed's rate hike if they want to avoid greater pressure on the currency that would cause market volatility to spread," Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interbank rates soared in 1998, as foreign reserves fell and the domestic money supply shrank. The HKMA took some unorthodox steps, such as buying Hong Kong stocks as the Hang Seng index plunged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A research note by strategist Ken Cheung at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1"> said Hong Kong's local banks and regulators will be aware of capital outflow risk and will consider lifting rates earlier, before the local currency hits 7.85 level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A surprisingly hawkish Fed at its policy meeting could push forward the timing of rate increase in Hong Kong and would probably trigger a deeper correction in local financial markets, Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some of the world's biggest banks and fund managers believe the renminbi is almost a shoe in to get into the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s elite currency basket this year, Beijing doesn't seem to feel that inclusion is in the bag.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the detailed 13th five-year plan released this week after the ruling Communist Party plenum, a brief line caught the attention of Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the all-encompassing blueprint spanning the next five years, "pushing for the renminbi to join the Special Drawing Rights" has been engraved. Such a goal was not carved into the 12th five-year plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This shows that not even at the top government level is there firm confidence for an inclusion at the review this month. Otherwise, why would they list it as a working item for the next five years?" Yeung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government confession of doubt, albeit crafted in a nuanced manner, stands in stark contrast with the widespread sanguine attitude of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's biggest banks and money managers have upped the decibel level in championing the renminbi's bid for SDR membership, a synthetic quasi-currency used as the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s account unit and rarely seen in financial transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1"> said the Chinese currency had a "more than 90 per cent chance"; </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> said it was almost a sure case that the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> executive board would give its nod on the application. </span><span class="s3">AXA Investment</span><span class="s1"> Managers, which overseas some 694 billion euros (HK$5.9 trillion), assigned an 80 per cent chance for inclusion in the November review, 15 per cent for a delay to 2016, and only a 5 per cent chance to miss the cut till 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the market chorus, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has yet to reveal the date on which its executive board will meet and review the basket's composition, which happens once every five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday, a report by the mainland's China Business News said the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> had delayed the date of the review from November 4th to the 30th. The report prompted the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> to rebut the report and reiterated the November time frame to discuss the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The exact board meeting date will be communicated once it has been set," the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has already delayed it once. I wouldn't be surprised if the day of November 30th slipped through without a decision being announced," said Yeung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> in early August delayed the effective date for a potential inclusion from the beginning of 2016 to September 30 of that year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining the SDR, now consisting of the dollar, euro, pound and yen, is viewed as a confidence boost to the yuan's status as a reserve currency, as well as being acknowledged as"freely usable", a milestone that would crown Beijing's long pursuit of internationalising its currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aidan Yao, senior emerging market economist at AXA Investment Managers, estimated that the yuan would be granted a 14 per cent weight in the SDR basket, vaulting past the share of the pound (11.3) and the yen (9.4) and trailing only the dollar (41.9) and euro (37.4).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, senior vice president for foreign exchange at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, the oldest private bank in the US, said his hunch was that the renminbi would be given a weight between 5 to 7, just under that of the yen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The potential issues arising from the treatment of Hong Kong's offshore yuan, the CNH, market may speak for a lower weight for the CNY," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> in its August report said the treatment of Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions and Taiwan "presents methodological issues for the computation of some indicator", such as whether transactions between mainland China and the other three regions shall be considered as international.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Chandler, similar to a lot of other currency and economic experts, thinks that the renminbi has "a good chance to get in". "It's a gradual process. First, get into the door, then gradually increase the weight as China's reserve share grows and [capital market] accessibility is enhanced," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao at </span><span class="s3">AXA</span><span class="s1"> estimated that in the most optimistic scenario, some US$600 billion capital will flow into China from supranational, official and private investors between 2016 and 2020, on the condition that the renminbi joins the SDR and that Beijing continues to open up access for private investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some US$40 billion, representing a 14 per cent share of the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s US$280 billion SDR portfolio, will be allocated by the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">. Another US$360 billion will be snapped up by foreign central banks, assuming that the renminbi accounts for 5 per cent of global reserves by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some US$200 billion will be bought by private investors, accounting for a 1 per cent share in the US$20 trillion portfolios around the world that tracks the Citi World Government Bond Index, which Yao used as a proxy for his calculation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Such capital inflow will counterbalance the capital outflow we have seen in China over the past year," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Sunac China Holdings</span><span class="s1">, one of China's largest property developers, denied a media report that China Huarong Asset Management was temporarily suspending new loans to the company amid tightening regulatory scrutiny, and warned it may take legal action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg had reported on Tuesday that Huarong's risk department had ordered a suspension of any new loans to Sunac that had not already been signed, effective September 18, citing an internal email its reporters had seen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The email called for heightened risk monitoring and attention to existing loans to Sunac, citing the developer's high gearing and debt as well as the regulator's increased focus on its rapid expansion, the Bloomberg report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have verified the matter with Huarong and they said they had never received any regulatory requirements concerning, or notices against, Sunac," </span><span class="s3">Sunac China</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement on Wednesday. "This is a unilateral misreading by the reporters."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Huarong has not stopped its business cooperation with Sunac. It will keep working with Sunac on the premise of controllable risks," the Sunac statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The false report by Bloomberg has created a negative impact on our company's reputation. We reserve the right to pursue legal action against it for publishing false reports about us," the statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its own statement, Huarong said that the Bloomberg report contained some "misunderstood information".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"So far, Huarong has not been notified of any regulatory requirements from the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> concerning, or notices against, Sunac," Huarong's statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is a unilateral misreading by the reporters."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Huarong's attention to Sunac is a routine process in client management. We did not stop business cooperation with Sunac, and we will keep working with Sunac on the premise of controllable risks, " it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg has been contacted for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday morning, shares of </span><span class="s3">Sunac China</span><span class="s1"> briefly sank 6.4 per cent to a low of HK$35.2, before reversing course and to rise as much as 1.3 per cent before closing the session up 0.4 per cent at HK$37.75.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huarong is China's biggest state-owned bad debt management firm by assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has stepped up regulatory scrutiny of leveraged investments due to mounting debt risks and persistent capital outflow pressure, and has focused particularly on overseas mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Media reports have said some of the country's biggest conglomerates have been investigated, including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda</span><span class="s1">, Hainan Airline Group, </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, and Fosun Group.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's economic policies were "completely able to adapt" to </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> interest rate rises, the foreign exchange regulator has said, adding the nation's economic fundamentals supported a stable capital base in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Chunying, spokeswoman of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on Thursday the Fed's rate increase in December had only a short-term effect on cross-border capital flows for China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the country saw capital outflows in the first quarter, the pressure had gradually eased and the yuan's exchange rate had stabilised, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies and individuals were repaying foreign debt at a slower pace than before and were less willing to hold foreign currencies, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since March, the market has formed a much clearer judgement on the path of the Fed's rate hikes," Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market believed the United States would ease back on pumping the rate, but maintain an eye on the impact of global financial markets on the American economy, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market's tolerance for risk was growing, while the strength of the US dollar was weakening, she said, noting the index measuring the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies dropped 5 per cent across February and March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's exchange rate had "started to stabilise", and China's cross-border capital flows had "returned to normal" to reflect economic fundamentals.Policies are completely able to adapt to the normalisation of the Fed's monetary policyWang Chunying, spokeswoman, </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The established economic and financial policies are completely able to adapt to the normalisation of the Fed's monetary policy," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China was under pressure to defend its currency and counter capital outflow following the Fed's rate increase at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign exchange reserves fell by about US$100 billion in December and January amid market jitters about the weakening yuan and a dimming outlook on growth in the world's second-largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the drain on reserves ended last month, rising by US$10.3 billion in March, to hit US$3.31 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said Beijing's overall policies would maintain the market's confidence in China's economic and reform direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the government would further promote currency reform along market lines, without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang also said the gap between the onshore and offshore yuan exchange rate narrowed in the first quarter. She didn't rule out the possibility of short-term, unexpected shocks to capital flows, but said the situation wouldn't affect long-term trends.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong insurers may be hit hard after a Chinese regulator for the industry warned mainland</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">residents on Friday about the risks of purchasing insurance products in Hong Kong, a city that became popular last year for mainlanders seeking Hong Kong- or US-dollar policies as the yuan weakened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the warning is to defend local insurers which lost business as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) </span><span class="s1">issued a statement on its website that said insurance products issued by Hong Kong insurers were not protected by mainland laws. It highlighted the legal fees for any insurance disputes are higher in the city. It also said policies bought in Hong Kong would face exchange-rate risks while Hong Kong has no regulation on dividend payment or cash values.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Policyholders would not get anything back if they surrendered their Hong Kong insurance policies within two years after the purchase,” the CIRC said. “The Hong Kong Insurance Claims Complaint Bureau can only handle compensation up to HK$1 million.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statement came just a few days after China Life issued a profits warning that its first half year result may drop 55 per cent to 60 per cent compared with the same period the year before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By contrast, AIA, the largest life insurer in Hong Kong, said on Friday that new business in its financial first quarter was worth US$578 million. That's an annual 36 per cent increase for the three months to the end of February and exceeded analysts' estimates of 18 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The contrast in results came after mainlanders spent HK$31.6 billion, or 24.2 per cent of the total new premiums of all life policies sold in Hong Kong last year, up from just 6 per cent in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurers said mainlanders like to come to Hong Kong to buy US- and Hong Kong-dollar policies to escape the exchange loss in light of the yuan's weakening. The Chinese currency dropped 5.6 per cent against the US dollar last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The CIRC warning shows the mainland regulator wants to defend mainland insurers which lost business to Hong Kong insurance companies when there are an increasing number of mainlanders now buying insurance products in Hong Kong,' Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector in the city, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We wish the mainland regulator wouldn't intervene in free-market competition. It should let the customers decide what products suit them best,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers Chief Executive Peter Tam said the CIRC only wanted to give a risk alert to mainlanders when they purchase policies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong Man-bun, Ben Kwong Man-bun, executive director of KGI Asia, said the CIRC warning came as the country worried about capital outflows due to the high amount of mainland money going into life policies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing in February curbed mainlanders' ability to use credit cards to pay for their policies in Hong Kong by instituting a US$5,000 cap.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The warning of CIRC comes as there are serious capital outflow problems in China. It is natural the country wants to discourage overseas insurance purchases,” Kwong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An insurance executive who did not want to be named said mainlanders have been big spenders for local insurance policies since last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would hit sales hard if China further curbs mainlanders' ability to buy insurance policies here. However, since there are still worries over the devaluation of the yuan against the US dollar, the mainlanders are likely to continue to buy policies in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever the United States does, the world takes notice. The Republican tax reform, led by the Trump White House, may be driven by purely domestic concerns but US trading partners, particularly China, are paying close attention. For those countries, capital outflow is a major worry. The most significant tax cut in three decades in the US may trigger a global race to slash taxes to compete for capital. This will particularly concern China, where tax income accounts for up to 80 per cent of fiscal revenue. Premier Li Keqiang has already made tax reform part of his policy agenda, with 1 trillion yuan (HK$1.18 trillion) to be slashed from corporate taxes. But the US move will add new pressure on the central government to act.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two different tax bills that have been passed in the </span><span class="s3">US Senate</span><span class="s1"> and House of Representatives still have to be harmonised before President Donald Trump can sign them into law. So it will take some time to gauge the effects of the tax cut on US competitiveness, productivity and workers' wages and the impact on the global economy. But Chinese policymakers do not have the luxury of time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What should Beijing do to cope with Donald Trump's tax cut? Chinese experts give their views[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2123365/what-should-beijing-do-cope-donald-trumps-tax-cut-chinese-experts]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some large mainland firms have already moved to the US, partly to escape high Chinese taxes. Among these, </span><span class="s3">Fuyao Glass Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> has opened the world's biggest assembly plant for automotive glass in Ohio, far from its old headquarters in Fuqing, Fujian province; and beverages bottler </span><span class="s3">Hangzhou Wahaha Group</span><span class="s1"> has been working on a possible takeover of the biggest US milk processor, </span><span class="s3">Dean Foods</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan's </span><span class="s3">Foxconn Technology</span><span class="s1">, one of the leading industrial employers on the mainland, is setting up a US$10 billion assembly plant in Wisconsin to take advantage of the state's generous tax breaks. No wonder the central government is keeping a close watch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Sino-US trade war may be upon us - and China may have the upper hand[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2123336/sino-us-trade-war-may-be-upon-us-and-china-may-have-upper]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it is not yet a cause for alarm. The Trump tax reform reduces corporate taxes from the nominal rate of 35 per cent to 20 per cent. Compared with China where a corporation may pay up to 40 per cent in taxes, a wide tax differential may seem to open up. In reality, most US corporations have been paying no more than 20 per cent in taxes, thanks to many loopholes in the tax code. Also, many Chinese companies prefer to operate in a familiar business and regulatory environment even if it means paying higher taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But one area should concern China. The Trump tax reform provides real incentives for US companies to repatriate their offshore profits and earnings. This may lessen the availability of US corporate capital to invest overseas. China still craves American technology, capital and innovation. It may have to create a more attractive business environment for investment, both foreign and domestic.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below US$3 trillion in January for the first time in six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The breach of the psychologically important level raises the question of whether they are still sufficiently large to guarantee Beijing's ability to continue supporting the yuan. The consensus among observers seems to be yes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the rapid fall in reserves serves as a warning sign that individuals and companies are still managing to get around regulations designed to prevent capital flight, analysts caution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of China's foreign exchange (forex) reserves slipped to US$2.998 trillion at the end of January, down US$12 billion from a month earlier, official data indicated. It was the seventh consecutive monthly drop and the first time the reserves have breached the US$3 trillion mark since February 2011.Our view is that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> can afford to keep selling FX at the current pace for a long timeJulian Evans-Pritchard, </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Excluding currency valuation effects, forex reserves may have fallen by US$37 billion in January, after declining US$35 billion in December, according to a </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">' estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves are “a telling indicator of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s [</span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">] eagerness to stem the yuan decline,” said Jingyi Pan, a strategist for </span><span class="s3">IG Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The breach of the psychological level raises concerns, though the authorities had done their part downplaying these concerns by stating that fluctuations in foreign exchange reserves is normal,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Much of the concern is focused on whether the central bank is still able to maintain its control of the stability of the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our view is that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> can afford to keep selling FX at the current pace for a long time,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist for London-based research firm </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">) guidelines suggest that, given the scale of China's export income, money supply, foreign liabilities and capital controls, its forex reserves could fall to as low as US$1.8 trillion and still offer adequate protection against balance of payment strains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, although the breach of US$3 trillion itself may not be hugely significant, the rapid decline in reserves is a red flag indicating that policies aimed at preventing money from escaping the mainland are flawed, according to some analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If there is anything that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> policy makers can take away from this reserve erosion, it is the fact the current financial market model they rely on is stale and in need of an overhaul,” said Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda Asia Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Despite their [the authority's] heavy-handed interventions, the reserve data clearly signals greater than anticipated capital flight and highlights the ineffectiveness of current policies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tim Condon, an analyst for ING Asia, said the current level of reserves, according to the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> standard, still remains adequate. But he expects the situation to become more urgent if Chinese residents continue transferring their money overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Capital controls could be tightened but that wouldn't dampen the sentiment,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He believes the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> may guide the yuan higher to fight the trend and ensure stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The most direct path would be for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to appreciate the CNY fixing,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China may tighten capital controls as yuan outflow continues[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2057673/china-may-tighten-capital-controls-yuan-outflow-continues]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> analysts also forecast that the erosion of reserves will prompt a more heavy-handed approach by the Chinese authorities to support the yuan and restrict residents from pulling money out of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If anything, the fall in China FX reserves to USD 2.998tn is not only confirmation that renminbi depreciation and capital outflow pressures remained evident as of end-January, but also that persistent reserves depletion should make the authorities rely on more capital controls and higher onshore rates to achieve stability,” said Kelvin Lau, Eddie Cheung, and Chidu Narayanan in a recent research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More liquidity tightening measures may be on the horizon, with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> likely to raise domestic interest rates further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe maintaining the interest rate differential with the US was one of the considerations behind the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s recent 10 bps [basis points] hikes across its reverse repo [repurchase agreements], medium-term lending facility and standing lending facility rates,” Lau and Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This, together with rising inflation and the need for deleveraging, means there could be another 20bps of such hikes in the pipeline before year-end.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said if capital controls are strictly enforced, China's outflows are likely to moderate to around US$400 billion in 2017 from above US$ 700 billion last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest regulatory challenge facing Chinese companies wanting to snap up European assets next year isn't political opposition from governments, it's getting the money out of the country in the first place, according to a leading London-based M&amp;A specialist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Richard Butterwick, a London-based partner with US-headquartered law firm </span><span class="s3">Latham &amp; Watkins</span><span class="s1">, was in Hong Kong then Beijing to take part in two conferences about China-outbound M&amp;A in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the major regulatory challenge for Chinese companies hoping to spend overseas were domestic Chinese policies that made it difficult to actually get their funds out the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's not about restrictions in Europe - it's about the ability of Chinese company to put themselves in a position domestically to get cleared to do a transaction and to have the clearance for their money to be used offshore. That is the real hurdle," he told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That process has been streamlined in recent years, and it's no coincidence that has coincided with an increase in outbound M&amp;A."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments were made last week, before sources told the Post of a central government policy shift designed to curb mainland China's outbound investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign investment ‘shopping spree' over as Beijing moves to slash capital outflow[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2050029/chinas-foreign-investment-shopping-spree-over-beijing-moves-slash]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent months there has been a series of instances of governments blocking Chinese investment in Europe, especially in Germany, where economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in October reopened a review of the Chinese takeover of the semiconductor company </span><span class="s3">Aixtron</span><span class="s1"> after a growing backlash to Chinese investment. It follows calls by Gabriel for </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> measures to give national governments more powers to block or impose conditions on shareholdings of non-EU companies.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next year, economists are expecting a backlash from European elections, Donald Trump coming to power in the US, and Brexit being triggered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Butterwick still expects M&amp;A into Europe from China to continue at significant levels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market has challenges, it always does, but it's a reasonably robust market," Butterwick said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We see strong interest from Chinese bidders in Europe and I would say that would continue at the same levels rather than see material changes."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The depreciation of sterling and the euro is helpful to maintain the already high levels of China M&amp;A in the major European economies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around 45 per cent of Chinese outbound M&amp;A activity, or US$94,839 million, as headed for Europe this year to date, more than any other region, according to Dealogic figures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Latham &amp; Watkins</span><span class="s1"> has more than 200 M&amp;A lawyers based in Europe. Butterwick's fellow partner Martin Saywell, also visiting Hong Kong from London, is equally optimistic about M&amp;A into the UK continuing after Brexit was triggered and does not see activity dropping off, despite a fall in volumes in the 11 weeks since the Brexit vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The UK needs foreign direct investment," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also played down the recent German moves against the Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are very political reasons why that decision has taken place, in the same way that the UK needs FDI for its own reasons, Germany and France and other countries in Europe need FDI and the most obvious source for that at the moment is from China."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saywell said it was more important to think about how to present a bid - and often the message that resonated most strongly, was ‘jobs and investment'.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If you see what's happened with the UK populist vote and also what's happened with the US as well, three things on people's agendas are jobs, investment and what the future means."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If it makes commercial, financial and business sense, it's well presented as being a proposition which increases jobs and investments, then it's very difficult to see why politics would trump rational, economic decisions like that."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Link Investment Holdings chairman and chief executive Brett McGonegal is among those who actually see Chinese outbound M&amp;A picking up next year due to the dropping value of the yuan, which some analysts think will devalue to 7.0 to the US dollar by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies aren't getting the returns they need onshore, so are looking offshore for returns through large-scale M&amp;As, he told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's counter intuitive, but the weaker currency actually is just a small part of the reason why China has embarked on a huge outbound M&amp;A spree, because they need to increase quality," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't necessarily think political risk is that big of a deal either, it's a land grab right now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The weaker Europe gets, the more desperate they are to sell assets."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese authorities are stepping up their monitoring of yuan outflow, in addition to tightening up scrutiny of overseas investments, in an attempt to curb the sharp depreciation of the currency since October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net outbound yuan payments have totaled 1.8 trillion in the year to date, while offshore yuan deposits declined by 255.7 billion yuan, according to new data compiled by Wind Information and </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (CICC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This suggests RMB outflows may have become a way for Chinese companies to circumvent foreign exchange (FX) controls, by moving capital across borders, and converting it into foreign exchange denominated assets offshore," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Offshore RMB lending to finance Chinese companies' overseas investment has become a key channel for RMB outflows, as have dividend payments and profit repatriation," the note said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Different levels of restriction over RMB and foreign exchange capital activities may have attracted regulatory arbitrage, and resulted in an the acceleration of RMB outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China may well incorporate RMB outflows into a unified macro-prudential regulatory framework for cross-border capital flow [in future] if the currency pressure heightens," it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some commercial banks have already been receiving guidance from the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, the central bank, on how to tighten their capital account controls, particularly when dealing with items involving overseas direct investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the past, any outflow below one billion yuan could be settled before reporting to the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE). But starting today, all outflow above 500 million yuan needs the signature of a local bank deputy governor," one banker with a Shanghai based state-owned commercial bank told the Post, asking not to be named.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The order we received is to strictly verify the source of capital and the purpose for overseas usage, to make sure the outflow is reasonable, and in accordance with rules and law," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has fallen over 6 per cent against the US dollar this year, dropping around 2 per cent since the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the US election, leaving it at an eight and a half year low against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign currency reserves have fallen to their lowest since March 2011 to US$ 3.12 trillion by the end of October, with the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> widely believed to have sold US dollars to cushion the currency's decline.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a bid to prevent continued sharp falls in the yuan, while at the same time halting the ongoing drain of the country's foreign exchange reserves, the government has enacted a string of measures, mainly blocking the outflow channels, including banning Chinese customers from buying overseas insurance products other than accident and medical-related policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported on Friday that China planed to tighten controls on companies looking to invest abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Targeted for particular scrutiny by the pending measures are "extra-large" foreign acquisitions valued at US$10 billion or more per deal, property investments by state-owned firms above US$1 billion and investments of US$1 billion or more by any Chinese company in an overseas entity unrelated to the investor's core business.The depreciation pressure on the yuan should ease as outflows taper, but that may only work temporarilyAdian Yao, senior emerging Asia economist, AXA Investment</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a statement from </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1">, four national authorities - the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC), the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, and SAFE - have made a joint that China is still promoting healthy outbound investment, but "will verify some overseas investment projects", according to rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adian Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment, said: "The tightening is meant to curb overseas investment using high leverage, or targets that are unrelated to the acquirer's core business, or those that are disguised capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The depreciation pressure on the yuan should ease as outflows taper, but that may only work temporarily," he said, adding in the short term, the movement of yuan is still largely dependent on the US dollar's momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's investment in private sector organisations remains low, at 27.7 per cent of GDP as of June, compared with 133.8 per cent of GDP for the US, and 161 per cent of GDP for Japan, according to the CICC note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rise of Chinese overseas investment is a long-term trend, but it should be a gradual process," it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It takes time for Chinese companies to learn and adapt to local cultures, ethical practises, regulatory standards... Leveraged deals that are not motivated by real investment opportunities but intrinsically one-way bets against the RMB may have to pay high "learning costs" when things turn unfavourable."</span></p>
