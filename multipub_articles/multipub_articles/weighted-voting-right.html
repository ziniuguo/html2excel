<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has submitted a proposal to the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, calling for the establishment of a new board and a review of the Growth Enterprise Market, according to a local media report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board should have different categories of companies and each segment should be open only to the appropriate type of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, start-up companies will only be open to professional investors as they offer higher risks Start- ups will also have lower listing thresholds. But US-listed multinational companies with weighted voting right structures, such as dual-class share structures, will be open even to retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board aims to attract US-listed multinational firms, particularly China IT companies, and shift their listing to Hong Kong, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board might also lure start- ups from China, Hong Kong and member countries of the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the exchange has drafted a proposal for the setting up of a new board. He stressed the importance of ensuring relevant measures are in place to protect retail investors if weighted voting right structures are to be permitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last October, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder said that it was not impossible to allow a version of the voting right structures to operate in the local market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks inched up yesterday after opening lower and falling to their lowest point since February 14 in the morning session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the close, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was at 31,044.25, up 199.53 points or 0.65 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Afternoon trading once saw the index surge 236 points to 31,081 after dropping to as low as 30,453 in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike past years, the sharp correction in Hong Kong stocks has not drawn swarms of mainland bargain hunters, suggesting to some market watchers that a sharper slide may be coming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US policy tightening would reduce liquidity in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ANZ said factors shaping the Hong Kong dollar this year include the HIBOR-LIBOR spread, which widened after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> ended the zero rate regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is expected that the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will issue more and lower aggregate balance to influence the Hong Kong interbank offered rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, higher fluctuation of the yuan is expected this year and will depend heavily on the US dollar and the international market, said Raymond Yeung, ANZ's chief economist, Greater China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700), which was most actively traded with a turnover of HK$11.93 billion, surged in late trading 3.42 percent to HK$447.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> closed 0.86 percent higher to HK$8.22. </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (2318), which once saw its two-week low in the morning, was up 1.5 percent to HK$84.70.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The best-performed blue chip yesterday was </span><span class="s3">Sino Land</span><span class="s1"> (0083), jumping 4.05 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC Hong Kong Financial Investment (1520), which is related to CEFC, plunged nearly 30 percent after news that CEFC chairman Ye Jianming has been investigated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing yesterday said that investors should understand the risks of investing in companies under the proposed dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said "The weighted voting right under the proposed revisions will be only entitled to individuals but the SFC is communicating with the local bourse to the feasibility of allowing companies to have the weighted voting right."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The introduction of dual-class technology stock listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely to</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">narrow the valuation gap between Chinese and US technology stocks listed in the United States, says the chief executive of exchange-traded fund manager Enhanced Investment Products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tobias Bland said that thanks to the impending launch of the weighted voting right governance structure by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, he expected several Chinese technology “marquee players” - smartphone giant Xiaomi as well as leading fintech players Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> - and Ping An Good Doctor to list with Hong Kong as their primary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights will also lead to dual listings in Hong Kong by technology companies that are already listed in the US as American depositary receipts, he said. Together, the growing number of technology stocks in Hong Kong will mean that the price-to-earnings multiples of Chinese technology American depositary receipts - and their respective share prices - would be due for an upgrade, said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weighted voting rights structure, which is still not allowed by Chinese regulators, will also incentivise more Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, industry players have long said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we look at Chinese American depositary receipts that make up our exchange-traded funds portfolio, last year they had a 70 per cent run on average in their share prices based purely on their revenue growth, which is about 40-50 per cent on average per year. Yet, they are trading at an average 28-29 times the 2018 expected earnings, which is a big gap compared with the 35 times average of US internet stocks,” said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American depositary receipts are the US dollar-denominated shares of a non-US company. Created by depositary banks, these represent one or several underlying shares from the company's local stock market, and are interchangeable with the underlying stocks.Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuationsJerry Peng, China equity strategist, Citi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors seeking to profit from price level differences between underlying stocks and their US-listed counterparts often create or cancel American depositary receipts through depositary banks. In such arbitrage trading strategies, investors target to profit by selling American depositary receipts trading at a premium to the underlying stock, and buying the underlying stock, or vice versa. Hence, arbitrageurs help to narrow out the price differentials that could exist across the two markets, enabling their prices to often track each other closely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Bland said, the good news for holders of American depositary receipts - such as those of </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, NetEase, Ctrip, Baidu, Alibaba - is that they can expect to see their price-to-earnings multiples getting re-rated by investors in the US market. Tencent, for example, is trading at forward multiples of more than 40 times, and that could be a level that the earnings multiples of other American depositary receipts could match as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the moment, their American depositary receipts performance is often hurt by a general scepticism among US investors about Chinese names,” he said. Contrarily, investors in China and Hong Kong have better understanding of their businesses as frequent users of their services, and such understanding will support Hong Kong-listed technology stocks' performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jerry Peng, China equity strategist at Citi, however, said that while he did not rule out that American depositary receipts might be boosted by strong investor sentiment around more Chinese technology stocks listing in Hong Kong, any such benefits are likely to be short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Offshore investors still look at fundamentals. Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuations,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peng said investors who trade American depositary receipts and Hong Kong stocks will still look at the American depositary receipt levels as reference for valuations, as many leading technology focused investors are still based in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of these American depositary receipt investors trade global technology stocks, including those listed in Korea, Taiwan and China … they already know a lot about these companies. Hence, in terms of knowledge of the issuers they are not significantly disadvantaged to Hong Kong investors,” said Peng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX is expected to launch a formal consultation on the proposed amendments to listing rules that will pave the way for the launch of weighted voting rights during the first quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Tesla supplier is offering 200 million shares, with 10 percent for the public with a minimum investment of HK$5353.41 per lot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company seeks to raise as much as US$676 million (HK$5.30 billion) from the Hong Kong initial public offering. It's expected to start trading on October 11.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in the first company, which lists with weighted voting right in Hong Kong, once fell to its lowest at HK$14.40, and down 35 percent from the peak level at HK$22.20 in July.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is host to the world's busiest venue for initial public offerings this year, but has suffered the worst losses in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A boom in technology listings has propelled local deal value to US$35.7 billion (HK$279.32 billion), ahead of the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Yet companies that raised at least US$100 million dropped 6.2 percent in their first month of trading on average, the worst return since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A sharp pickup in IPOs may signal a sector's down cycle ahead," said Liang Jinxin, a strategist at Tianfeng Securities. "Technology companies fear an industry downturn will get worse if they don't go public now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New-economy firms accounted for more than 40 percent of Hong Kong's proceeds this year, up from about 20 percent in 2017. But they have also been some of those that suffered the most, with giant Tencent (0700) heading for its worst year on record.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing reform to attract technology companies helped boost IPO supply, but the demand remained slack amid macro weakness, said Philippe Espinasse, former head of Asia's equity capital markets group at Nomura.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both firms listed with weighted voting right, smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810) and food-delivery giant </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> (3690) fell yesterday, with the latter losing 4.38 percent and extending a record low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For firms that raised more than US$100 million in Hong Kong this year, individual investors placed orders for a median 1.6 times the stock available to them, down from 2.4 times in 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Despite sluggish demand, Chinese companies decided to go ahead with their listings to bolster their war chests as the United States increased interest rates and fought with China on trade, Espinasse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, mainland telecom software firm </span><span class="s3">AsiaInfo Technologies</span><span class="s1"> (1675) closed at HK$10.02 on its market debut yesterday, 4.57 percent lower than its IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, </span><span class="s3">Pacific Millennium Packaging</span><span class="s1">, the mainland corrugated packaging supplier, has raised HK$299.13 million after setting its IPO price at HK$3.98, the bottom of its indicative range.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other news, Chinese power supplier Sichuan Energy Investment Development has raised HK$476 million from its float after pricing in the bottom half of the range of HK$1.76 to HK$2.34, according to Reuters IFR.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record 220 companies are expected to list in Hong Kong this year, raising about HK$300 billion, twice as much as last year, according to Deloitte International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm also revealed that HK$243.4 billion was raised from IPOs in the first three quarters of the year, adding that the city will regain its crown as the world's top IPO destination in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-leaders of National Public Offering Group of Deloitte China, said new-economy firms have dominated the IPO market, with three out of top five IPOs this year being new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dick Kay, co-leaders of National Public Offering Group of Deloitte China, said the weighted-voting right structure implemented this year by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has been very successful, as the new rule was only implemented early this year but two companies have already listed on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, another accountancy firm EY said Hong Kong's IPO market experienced sharp spikes in the third quarter this year by both deal number and proceeds, with 18 percent of IPOs and 49 percent of global proceeds during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We saw the positive impact of new listing regulations on the Hong Kong IPO market," Ringo Choi, EY Asia-Pacific IPO leader said. "However, IPO activity was also negatively impacted by interest rate hikes and investors looking for interest rate-driven investments, a trend which could continue in 2019."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> reported on Wednesday a 44 per cent increase in interim earnings, boosted by a raft of initial public offerings that helped it regain the top spot in global fundraising rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX said on Wednesday its interim net profit stood at HK$5.04 billion (US$642.1 million) or HK$4.07 per share, up from HK$3.49 billion a year earlier. This is the highest half-year profit since the exchange was established and listed in 2000. It is also higher than the 37 per cent profit growth to HK$4.8 billion estimated by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's shares closed 1 per cent higher at HK$229 following the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After deducting first-quarter profit of HK$2.56 billion, net profit for the second quarter from April to June stood at HK$2.48 billion, up 40 per cent from a year earlier and beating Nomura's estimate of 22 per cent year-on-year profit growth to HK$2.16 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the first half of 2018, the world's financial markets experienced bouts of volatility following significant corrections across major stock markets. Investor sentiment was dominated by uncertainties over escalating US-China trade tensions, geopolitical risk in several parts of the world and policy divergence of major central banks. Lingering uncertainties are likely to cast a dark cloud over global markets for the remainder of this year,” said Laura Cha Shih May-lung, chairwoman of HKEX, in her first interim results statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the world enters a new era of fintech, there will be many opportunities as well as challenges. At HKEX, an innovation lab was established to explore the increased use of emerging technologies in various parts of our business, both operationally and strategically,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse's trading and clearing fee income was boosted by rising average daily turnover, which increased 67 per cent to HK$126.6 billion in the first half, compared with HK$76 billion in the first half of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee income rose as 108 companies launched IPOs in the first half, up 50 per cent from 72 last year, after the HKEX in April started accepting dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotech firms without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told reporters at a late afternoon press conference on Wednesday that Hong Kong had reclaimed the top spot in global fundraising rankings thanks to the trading debuts of China Tower and </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is back to No 1 worldwide in terms of IPO funds raised,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wednesday action catapulted Hong Kong ahead of the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in terms of global rankings, bringing its year-to-date fundraising to HK$187 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have received three weighted voting right companies and nine biotech firms applying to list in Hong Kong under the new listing regime. There are dozens of more companies making enquiries,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He cautioned of challenges ahead in the second half due to lower turnover as investors focused on rising trade tensions between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/08/fec6023e-9949-11e8-9a20-262028f49e8a_image_hires_201439.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's board said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$3.64 per share, up 43 per cent from HK$2.55 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect scheme linking Hong Kong with mainland China exchanges brought in revenue of HK$365 million in the first half, more than double the HK$162 million a year earlier. Funds from mainland Chinese investors into Hong Kong stocks now represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of market turnover.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a large pipeline of ‘new economy' listings which, in our view, could change the market dynamics and structurally lead to higher turnover,” said York Pun, an HSBC analyst, in a research note before the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Robert Lee Wai-wang, executive director of Hong Kong-based broker Grand Finance Group, said he was upbeat on the earnings prospects for HKEX in the second half in spite of global political and economic headwinds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market turnover of HKEX in the second half of this year may be affected by the poor market sentiment. The US and China trade war may continue to haunt markets. Interest rate rises would also have an negative impact. However, the listing reform could bring in more technology firms and biotech companies to list. The long-term outlook of HKEX remain positive,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will hold a press conference in the afternoon to discuss the results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is gaining traction as the primary choice for mainland technology firms seeking to float as they shun stock exchanges in New York, and mainland China, amid the two countries' simmering trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frank Lin, a partner at PwC in Shanghai, said an increasing number of Chinese companies are seeking to raise capital in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sectors on the city's stock market, as they assess the ongoing and potential future impact of the trade stand-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US-China trade war is expected to escalate in the foreseeable future, and it is going to affect decision-making by Chinese TMT firms looking to choose listing venues,” he said, adding that mainland companies are also closely analysing the spat's effect on their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle among regional and global stock exchanges to attract prospective Chinese technology firms escalated in the first half of this year when mainland regulators attempted to up their ante in easing IPOs by foreign-funded mainland companies through the Chinese depositary receipts (CDR) mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Announced in March and aimed especially at luring overseas-incorporated technology leaders, the CDR enables mainland investors that are barred from freely moving their money abroad, to directly trade-in the underlying securities issued overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pick up in IPO business in Hong Kong is significant, given the high stakes involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Shanghai eclipsed Hong Kong for the first time in both the number of IPOs and the amount of capital raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with mainland exchanges for global fundraising crown[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the recent lacklustre performance of the A-share market has deterred mainland regulators from launching any CDRs, with not a single Chinese technology firm jumping aboard so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online parenting firm Babytree Group and AsiaInfo, the leading provider of telecom software and information-technology services, are among the mainland technology firms to have already submitted applications to the Hong Kong exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the industry watchdog, also sets a higher listing threshold for start-ups, requiring any IPO applicant to have posted a profit before even filing papers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months of this year, only four Chinese TMT companies completed IPOs in Hong Kong, but that number is expected to soar in the second half buoyed by rising enthusiasm in raising funds on the market, says Lin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1810&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] netted HK$37.1 billion (US$4.7 billion) through an IPO before China Tower Corp[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=0788&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which operates the telecommunications towers for the world's biggest cellular phone networks, completed a HK$54.3 billion share sale the following month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin said Hong Kong's efforts to ease listing requirements for tech companies have paid off handsomely, with reforms on both the city's weighted voting right (WVR) structure and the allowing of pre-revenue biotech firms to list on the local stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The WVR structure, or multiple classes of shares, also allows company founders to exert stronger control on a listed business, even with a minority ownership.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has gained the upper hand in attracting hundreds of promising mainland tech firms hungry for capital,” said Ding Haifeng, a consultant with Integrity Financial Consulting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the next few months, it's certain that more companies will consider listing in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
