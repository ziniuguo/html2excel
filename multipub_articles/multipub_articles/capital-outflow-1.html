<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan weakened to a fresh 4-year low yesterday, as the market expects further capital outflow amid an economic slowdown in China and an interest hike in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore, the yuan extended its losing streak to 10 days " the longest since 2007 " to close at 6.4837 per dollar, down 0.17 percent from the previous session. In offshore Hong Kong trading, the currency reversed its two-day gain, slipping 0.59 percent to 6.5627 against the greenback as at 7.48pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has lost 4.56 percent in six months. Lian Ping, chief economist of Bank of Communications, said the US rate hike will bring more pressure on capital outflow and currency devaluation in China. ``The rate hike has largely reduced the chance for China to cut its interest rate further,'' Lian said, ``but more cuts of required reserve ratios are expected to foster economic growth.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many international investment banks expect the onshore yuan to weaken a further 5-7 percent versus the US dollar over the next 12 months. ``The Chinese are already devaluing. Capital outflows were probably strong in December,'' said </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. His calculations suggest US$30 billion to US$40 billion (HK$234 billion to HK$312 billion) will flow out of China monthly over the next year. Capital outflow has forced local banks to raise deposit rates to attract yuan capital for months. </span><span class="s3">BOC Hong Kong</span><span class="s1"> (3288) said yesterday it would offer selected customers a 3.7 percent annualized return, for a minimum of 20,000 yuan deposit, carrying a three- or six-month tenure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some still remain positive. Mark Mobius, the so-called father of emerging markets, said currencies in emerging markets are undervalued, including the Indian rupee and the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``There are tremendous opportunities for a recovery in these currencies,'' Mobius told </span><span class="s3">Bloomberg Television</span><span class="s1">, adding that the modest rise in US rates will not affect such a rebound.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland will post a record capital outflow this year of more than US$500 billion (HK$3.9 trillion), a report by the </span><span class="s3">Institute of International Finance</span><span class="s1"> shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IIF, an authoritative tracker of emerging market capital flows, said the country is likely to see US$150 billion worth of capital outflow in the last quarter, following the third quarter's record US$225 billion, as its trade surplus narrowed in November amid a decline in exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The estimate is also based on the mainland's forex reserve, which shrank US$87 billion to US$3.44 trillion last month amid the yuan depreciation " a trend likely to continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan yesterday closed at its weakest level since July 2011, after the central bank said on Friday it had begun publishing a yuan exchange rate weighted against a basket of currencies, which will eventually loosen the currency's greenback link.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the midpoint rate at 6.4495 per dollar prior to market open, its weakest level since 2011. The spot market closed at 6.4591, its weakest point in more than four years, 0.06 percent weaker than the previous close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore in Hong Kong, the yuan's slide picked up pace after Friday's announcement. It traded at a four-year low of 6.5488 per dollar and down 0.25 percent from Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The weightings clearly show that China intends to get rid of the yuan's reliance on the US dollar over time,'' said Huang Yi, head of forex trading at </span><span class="s3">China Guangfa Bank</span><span class="s1"> in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``As such, the yuan's movements will be more market-oriented and rely on economic and financial fundamentals in the long run.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is set to depreciate in the near term due to a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and a strengthening dollar as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> prepares to raise interest rates this week, traders said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Stephen Roach, former non- executive chairman for Morgan Stanley in Asia, said at a forum yesterday that the rate hike will not hugely affect China's economy and a hard landing will not be seen in the country. The yuan, after 10 years of appreciation, is becoming market- oriented and will swing around the current level, Roach added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Divisions are appearing among top economists, over the likely impact of Brexit on China's macro economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign analysts expect China will allow further deprecation of yuan to offset any export pressure caused by the British breakaway, while mainland-based commentators are tending to argue the currency rate will remain stable, and cash outflow will also be kept under control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists at BofA Merrill Lynch have cut their annual 2016 GDP forecast for China by 0.2 percentage points to 6.4 per cent, largely due to a tightening in domestic financial conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they did add, there could be an indirect drag on China's economic growth from Brexit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As direct trade links between China and the UK are far from strong, the forecast revision is based on potential tightening in financial conditions in China, resulting from capital outflow triggered by yuan depreciation," BofA Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a research report, issued Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their biggest concern was based on the expectation that </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> will have to allow faster depreciation of the yuan against the US dollar in the aftermath of Brexit, to offset building pressure on exports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As part of the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s (</span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">) easing measures to counter downside growth risks in China, the risks of undershooting in monetary easing remain high in the second half of 2016," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consequently the inadvertent tightening in financial conditions will likely hurt growth in the third and fourth quarters this year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some, including Li Yimin, an macro economy analyst with Shenyin Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, disagree with the assumption that aggressive capital outflows will cause domestic liquidity tightening, forcing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to adopt monetary easing hard to manage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and other financial regulators are becoming more skilled in stemming capital flight, particularly after the lessons they learned from the two intensive capital outflows following the yuan's abrupt deprecation, last August and this January," said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An analyst with a Beijing based brokerage, who preferred to remain anonymous, said he felt the authorities are now setting aside reform of the capital account after the Brexit, in favor of focusing on?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">stabilising the currency, balancing the flow of funds, and tightening capital-account control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In this case, there is no need to worry about intensive outflow," he said, "so I do not anticipate any considerable easing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai banking sources told the SCMP on Tuesday that the city's foreign exchange authority had asked banks to strengthen due diligence checks on overseas direct investment, to stem illegal capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> on Monday cut the yuan's fixing to 6.6375 against the US dollar, the lowest level in five and a half years, as the pound dropped to a three-decade low after Britain's stunning decision to break from the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's daily fixing dropped 0.9 per cent from the previous trading day, marked the biggest 24-hour drop since August, when the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> made an abrupt move to devalue the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said the yuan's speed of depreciation still lagged behind that of other Asian currencies, arguing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was likely to accelerate the devaluation to maintain export competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BofA Merrill Lynch analysts said they expected the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to push onshore yuan to 6.8, and above, against the US dollar in coming months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said this would cause another pick up in capital outflow, and the central bank would then have to allow faster domestic expansion to maintain stability in money creation, a similar cycle to what happened last year.With the Brexit risks becoming a reality, we see significant downside pressures on China's growth from trade, capital outflow and financial market channelsNomura analyst note</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then, companies with dollar-denominated liabilities rushed to repatriate their debt, after the drastic depreciation in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This kind of debt repayment became a key driver of capital outflow," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To maintain money creation stability, the central bank had to allow faster domestic expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It wasn't until February or March this year that it regained control of liquidity with the help of foreign exchange controls, and stabilising the dollar exchange rate."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consequently, diminishing capital outflow gave way to a rebound in property and infrastructure investment," it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nomura analysts shared the concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the Brexit risks becoming a reality, we see significant downside pressures on China's growth from trade, capital outflow and financial market channels," they wrote in a note issued on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nomura has now cut China's real GDP growth forecasts by 0.4 percentage points for the second half, leaving the 2016 full-year forecast at between 6.0 per cent and 6.2 per cent growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Daokui, a former external adviser to the International Monetary Fund who now heads a top think tank for the central government, argued the Brexit may well offer more opportunities to China, as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on trade and investment from the country.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A statement from the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) blamed seasonal factors for the larger than expected fall [in foreign reserves], including forex purchases for overseas travel and bond repayments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's capital outflow has moderated a lot and it will move towards a balance in the future,” it said. “The current reserves are adequate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, February 8</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I shall accept that bit about the reserves being adequate but it doesn't really mean much any longer. Adequacy of foreign reserves is an outdated concept from the days of the gold standard when countries worried themselves about how many months of imports they could pay for with their reserves if their export earnings collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The remedy these days is floating exchange rates and foreign borrowings. This is one of those rare instances in which human thinking has actually progressed. To put it in perspective, the United States, with a US$19 trillion economy, has foreign reserves of only US$117 billion while China, with a US$11 trillion economy has reserves of almost US$3 trillion, about 45 times as much relative to economic size and by far the world's largest reserve hoard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/12/a6295ad0-f086-11e6-8960-2c6b8565de23_image_hires.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet it is China that obsesses about the adequacy of foreign reserves. You never hear of it in the US. But what is not true in the SAFE statement, is that China's capital outflow has moderated. The chart sets out the facts. Capital outflow at the end of 2016 was still running at US$653 billion a year, only slightly less than a running figure of US$673 billion at the end of September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is not a moderate amount, nor has it “moderated a lot”. My authority here is SAFE itself, the government agency that calculates China's balance of payments statistics and published the fourth quarter ones earlier this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The difficulty here is that most commentators on capital outflow, including SAFE officials, measure it only as how much the foreign reserves have declined over any given period. That would be US$12.3 billion over one month, US$122 billion over three months and US$232 billion over a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves drop below US$3 trillion for first time in six years[https://www.scmp.com/news/article/2068798/chinas-forex-reserves-drop-below-us3-trillion-first-time-6-years]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is not entirely an accurate measure as it ignores changes in the US dollar value of securities in other currencies but it does indeed represent capital outflow. People fleeing yuan have been given the US dollars they want from the foreign reserves, which are thus depleted. However, there is also another form of capital flight. It arises when exporters understate their true export income to Beijing and then keep the difference abroad. Alternatively they stint themselves on imports of raw materials and component goods, which also allows them to keep export earnings abroad. This is likely to be a good part of what produces a merchandise trade surplus now running at US$547 billion a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are other tricks as well, such as declaring as tourist expenditure what is actually personal capital flight. It is what I think we largely have in SAFE's reference to “larger than expected ... forex purchases for overseas travel.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we shall just do it the technical way. Non-reserve movements in the capital account on the balance of payments plus errors and omissions (which comprise little more than unreported capital movements) showed an outflow of US$187 billion in the fourth quarter last year and US$653 billion for the year overall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's how you calculate a country's capital flows and the calculation continues to show an enormous outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US interest rate rise on Thursday is likely to lead to increased capital outflow from Hong Kong and the mainland, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> increased the official base rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent on Thursday, just hours after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> increased the benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a range between 0.50 per cent and 0.75 per cent - the first rate rise in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the peg link system which means the Hong Kong dollar tracks the US dollar, the city needs to synchronise with any US interest rate movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US interest rates now rising, it's expected that some of the estimated US$130 billion of capital inflow into Hong Kong since 2008 will be exchanged back to the US dollar," said the HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan, during a press conference in Hong Kong today. "A capital outflow from Hong Kong is expected, and the Hong Kong dollar may trade at the weaker end of the peg at HK$7.85 per US dollar."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Link International chief executive Brett McGonegal believes there will be two to three more rate rises next year, which will lead to a strong US dollar against other currencies, including the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The RMB will certainly be under more pressure from the strong dollar, but I'm not sure if we will see much more [movement] than we have seen recently," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Hong Kong overall, he believes the rate rise will be negative, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Money will become expensive, pushing property stocks lower and slowing transactions. I don't like the look of the Hong Kong market over the next year. A tightening Fed is the wrong prescription for the current chill Hong Kong is feeling," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, said the US interest rate rises will mean the greenback will continue to strengthen against the yuan, pushing the Chinese currency to as low as 7.20 yuan/dollar by the end of next year, down 4 per cent from the 6.90 current level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Part of the outflow from China, especially the part that reflects the paying down of dollar debt, may continue," Chandler said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Beijing's recent moves of adding capital controls, however, could help minimise the outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government last month carried out a number of measures to control the outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They included a ban on mainlanders using credit cards to buy Hong Kong insurance products, and from the end of last month </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> also limited bank lending to the equivalent of 30 per cent of an applicant's equity in an overseas firm in yuan.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency has fallen 7 per cent against the US dollar this year, after a drop of 5 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The devaluation has led to a wave of capital outflow by both individuals and companies to buy stocks, insurance policies, and other overseas investment products and assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves fell more than expected in November, by US$69 billion to US$3.052 trillion compared with US$3.121 trillion in October, according to government statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marked the largest monthly decline since January and was similar to the average monthly reduction of US$70.1 billion from August to January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> report estimates that around 70 per cent of the drop was due to the falling value of the yuan against the dollar, following the US presidential election. Excluding valuation effects, foreign reserves still declined by US$21 billion in November, compared with a fall of US$9 billion in October, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, said Beijing is likely to add further controls next year to limit the outflow, and stop the rapid depreciation in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Rather than allowing a significant exchange rate adjustment to deter the potential outflow, the authorities have sought a combination of exchange rate support and additional capital controls," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectiveness."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda, however, said the government measures would not halt the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US dollar expected to strengthen into the year end, the feedback loop will accelerate as the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> continues to burn through reserves to stem the tide.These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectivenessMark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Moreover, I suspect the recent measures to curb loopholes in capital outflow will not turn the tide for depreciating yuan. These capital controls will likely accelerate in 2017," Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Wong, Asia equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, said the interest rate rise would not only lead to capital outflow from China, but also from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the Fed raises interest rates faster than market consensus of two rises in 2017, then there is no doubt Hong Kong could also see pressure with capital outflows," Wong said</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Just look at the 1-month HIBOR [Hong Kong interbank offer] rate, it's gone from 0.36 per cent before the US elections to now 0.62 per cent in a little over a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the unexpected strengthening of the US dollar and acceleration of interest rate rises in the US, capital could start to flow out of Hong Kong and that could have a major impact for its financial sector," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Wong believes the yuan will face pressure, he considers worries surrounding a significant RMB devaluation have probably been overdone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Chinese authorities seem to be pursuing currency and market policies that promote stability. The RMB is now included in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights and given China's economy is still able to maintain over 6 per cent GDP growth, long-term investors in China shouldn't have too much to fear about significant RMB weakness," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmund Yun, head of investment solutions at CIC Investor Services, believes there will be three more rate hikes next year, but that the next won't be until June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although the RMB has continued its weakening trend against the US dollar following the US election, it has in fact appreciated against the euro and the Japanese yen, as recent economic data from China has shown there are some improvement in economic growth," Yun said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Looking forward, we believe the RMB will probably continue to weaken against the US dollar but on a more gradual basis, probably in line with other major currencies such as the euro or yen. We may see RMB to surpass 7.0 to the dollar within 2017," Yun said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US interest rate rise on Thursday is likely to lead to increased capital outflow from Hong Kong and the mainland, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> increased the official base rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent on Thursday, just hours after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> increased the benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a range between 0.50 per cent and 0.75 per cent - the first rate rise in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the peg link system which means the Hong Kong dollar tracks the US dollar, the city needs to synchronise with any US interest rate movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the US interest rates now rising, it's expected that some of the estimated US$130 billion of capital inflow into Hong Kong since 2008 will be exchanged back to the US dollar," said the HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan, during a press conference in Hong Kong today. "A capital outflow from Hong Kong is expected, and the Hong Kong dollar may trade at the weaker end of the peg at HK$7.85 per US dollar."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said yesterday banks' profitability improved last year, but warned US interest rate hikes may prompt capital outflow that affect banks' liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local banking sector recorded a 8.7 increase in pre-tax operating profit last year, compared to a 3.6 percent fall in 2015. The growth was mainly driven by the 2 percent rise of both interest and non-interest income, said deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen Kwok-hang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks also benefited from less loan- impairment charges and operating cost, which dropped 16 percent and 3 percent, respectively, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net interest margin last year remained at the same level of 1.32 percent, while credit growth reached 6.5 percent - 3 percentage points higher than 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA this year will focus more on controlling the liquidity risk of banks, and then credit risk and cyber security risk, Yuen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Considering the possible interest rate hike this year and the trillions of dollars in capital that flowed into Hong Kong during the 2008 financial crisis, any large capital outflow from the SAR would put pressure on the liquidity of banks, he warned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuen said the HKMA will strengthen the pressure test to measure whether the banks have adequate liquidity and comprehensive liquidity mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority also planned to launch a "mystery customer" survey in the first half this year, in order to investigate how the banks operate when they open bank accounts, and how they maintain their business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, new residential mortgage loan applications declined 26 percent month on month to 10,505 in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mortgage loans approved last month fell by 15.7 percent to HK$32.5 billion, while the outstanding value grew 0.9 percent to HK$1.12 trillion as the December 31, HKMA data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ratio of new mortgage loans priced with reference to Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate slipped 0.2 percentage point to 94.9 percent last month, while loans priced with reference to the prime rate rose to 2.5 percent from 1.9 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuen said the recent rising HIBOR has led to the higher interest rate of HIBOR-based mortgages. He appealed to banks to ensure they have enough profit to support when they set the interest rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the number of home loans in negative equity declined to four cases by the end of December, from 69 cases in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The aggregate value fell to HK$11 million from HK$282 million in the same period, while the unsecured portion dropped to HK$80,000 from HK$6 million.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> left rates unchanged as expected, but the text of the statement was more dovish.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Markets now expect only two interest rate hikes this year as US growth forecasts were lowered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the US economy expanding steadily since January, with household consumption growing mildly and further improvement in the property and labor markets, fixed business investment and net exports dropped.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inflation edged higher in recent months, but was still lower than the 2 percent target as oil prices fell.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As global economic and financial development have embedded risk, the Fed's cautious mood is reasonable. As it has no interest in pushing the dollar higher, yen and gold prices rebounded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With America being the world's biggest debtor, policymakers will definitely be in no hurry to raise interest rates " particularly when Europe and Japan are implementing negative rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A weaker dollar allowed the yuan to rebound to the 6.47 level in Hong Kong, about 4 percent stronger than its January level. Hopefully, this will temporarily stop the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was said that China had lost about US$500 billion (HK$3.9 trillion) of foreign currency deposits last year and another US$110 billion in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If this pace maintains, all foreign currency deposits (now US$3.7 trillion) in China will disappear soon.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah expects the economy to grow slower in the second half amid a volatile financial market and weak exports and tourism, but stresses Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remain sound.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Hong Kong will inevitably be influenced by many external uncertainties " the timing and pace of the US interest rate hike is unknown, Europe's and Japan's economies have yet to recover, and the downward pressure of the Chinese economy,'' he wrote on his blog yesterday. ``But I think we don't have to be too concerned or pessimistic.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Growth in the second quarter was 2.8 percent, better than expected, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang expects the annual GDP rate will be between 2 percent and 3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span class="s1"> has affirmed Hong Kong's AAA credit rating, with ``stable'' outlook, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang also noted that Hong Kong's current account and fiscal budget are in surplus territory, indicating healthy fundamentals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is in contrast to countries like India, Indonesia and Turkey, which have deficits in their current accounts and fiscal budgets " ``usually the sign of a structural problem and imbalance,'' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He highlighted the risks faced by emerging markets, after their foreign debts increased in the past few years. It may be a ``double blow'' for these economies when they face a capital outflow and the pressure of an interest rate hike at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The rate increase would dampen investment sentiments, which may further the price adjustment of asset markets,'' Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Emerging markets have already seen heavy capital outflow in the past few weeks, coupled with steep depreciation in currencies and a sharp slump in the stock market, he noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As examples, he pointed out that, for August, Brazil's real dropped 4 percent, the Malaysian ringgit and Russian ruble plunged around 10 percent, and the Turkish lira and South African rand fell to their lowest in years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among stock markets, Tsang said Indonesia has fallen some 15 percent since the start of the year, while Malaysia and Thailand have dropped about 8 percent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In order to stop capital outflow, China said it will crack down on a popular tool " UnionPay credit and debit cards. It is well known that Chinese gamblers use such cards for cash advances in Macau either for gambling or simply to take their money out of the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past ten years, local insurance agents have worked hard to tap this market. As long their clients come to Hong Kong to sign insurance contracts " mostly in US dollars " it is legal. Using UnionPay is convenient. But Beijing has now imposed a limit. A maximum US$5,000 (HK$39,000) may be used per single transaction to buy overseas insurance products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AIA (1299) fell 4.8 percent yesterday to a 1-year low at HK$38.95 while Manulife (0945) slumped 5 percent. AIA said the effect is not big as it does not limit the number of transactions per day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Widespread market talk surfaced recently about a Chinese citizen who purchased an insurance contract from a well- known firm in the SAR. The premium was HK$100 million! The agent received a huge commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then two months later the client canceled the contract and got back the premium. The agent disappeared. Now many local insurers are very cautious. Dr Check and/or The Standard bear no responsibility for decisions made based on this column</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said the recent decline of interbank liquidity was mainly due to additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills " short- term debt securities " amid concerns of a capital outflow to tighten liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA's aggregate balance " the level of interbank liquidity that rises or falls when the authority intervenes in the currency market " stood at HK$370.4 billion yesterday, compared to HK$381.3 billion at the end of last year and the peak of HK$424.4 billion in November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The level was below HK$200 billion for most of the time in the past five years. Abundance of interbank liquidity could prevent Hong Kong from lifting the interest rate in the near term, as analysts predicted the hike could start in June this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA, led by chief executive Norman Chan Tak-Lam, has issued more than HK$70 billion of additional Exchange Fund Bills since November due to strong demand, it said in a report to be presented to the Legislative Council next week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local dollar weakened to around 7.8 against the greenback from the strong side of 7.75 since the beginning of the year, ``reflecting the widened interest differential with the US dollar, the correction in the local stock market and general weakness in Asian currencies,'' the HKMA said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate grew to 0.6969 percent yesterday, compared to 0.3950 at the start of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA noted that local retail banks saw loan impairment charges surge 67 percent in the first three quarters last year, leading to a 0.9 percent edging down on their pre-tax operating profit in the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Asset quality of retail banks' loan portfolio deteriorated slightly but remained healthy by historical standards,'' the authority said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for the offshore yuan business in Hong Kong, the dim sum bond " or yuan denominated bonds issued in the SAR " dived 63.6 percent to 68.7 billion yuan (HK$81.35 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outstanding dim sum bonds reached 371.3 billion yuan, slightly down from 380.5 billion yuan at the end of 2014. Yuan loans, on the other hand, spiked 58.3 percent to 297.6 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan trade settlement handled by local banks in the 11 months ended November grew 10 percent from a year earlier.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun- wah warned the local financial and property market will fluctuate in the short term following the bond tapering by the US Federal Reserve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he has not seen any capital flowing out the city yet, and estimates the interest rates increases in the United States will not happen soon. However, he stressed there is a possibility for Hong Kong to raise interest rates before the United States if there is a large-scale capital outflow, and it will exert pressure on those bearing home mortgages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang added that Hong Kong has sufficient capital and funds to cope with the massive outflow and inflow of capital, while the linked exchange rate system can provide stability to the local currency. The comments followed the Federal Reserve decision to modestly trim the pace of its monthly asset purchases, by US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) to US$75 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At his last scheduled news conference as Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke said the purchases would likely be cut at a measured pace through much of next year if job gains continue as expected, with the program fully shuttered by late- 2014. The Fed said its benchmark interest rate is likely to stay low well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Fed's 2 percent goal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose 260 points in the morning session but closed 255 points lower at 22,888.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US stocks and the gold price fell while Treasury 10-year yields climbed last night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> acting chief executive Eddie Yue Wai-man said asset prices in emerging markets would be under pressure amid possible capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Association of Banks chairman Benjamin Hung Pei-ching believes the US interest rate increase will not start until 2015, and Hong Kong's will not vary too much from that of the United States. He said the tapering scale remained mild, thus it will not have a huge impact on the local capital flow and interest rates as well as currency rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mortgage brokerage services provider M-Referral said Hong Kong would face an interest rate increase if the banks' outstanding balance falls below HK$100 billion, though it now remains above HK$160 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po says Hong Kong must follow the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s pace in raising interest rates if the economy is to be sustained, but investors should beware of some of the effects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investor caution is a must as US rate rises might push up Hong Kong asset prices, Chan said, and property projects commencing in the next few years will be affected. Still, SAR interest rate adjustments depend on the availability of onshore capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said the Fed's plan to start shrinking its balance sheet may lead to capital outflows from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the gap between Hong Kong and US interest rates continues to widen, the Hong Kong dollar will weaken toward 7.85 against the greenback, said the authority's acting chief executive, Eddie Yue Wai-man.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When it touches 7.85, we'll see a capital outflow," he said. "Then the Hong Kong interest rate will slowly increase."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged at 7.8 to the US dollar since 1983 but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Yue noted that Hong Kong's deposit and lending rates remained unchanged despite four US rate hikes since December 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The timing, the pace of capital outflow and arbitrage activities are affected by different factors," he added. "But as the gap widens a Hong Kong interest rate hike is bound to happen."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA has issued exchange bills for two consecutive months, which tightened market liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additionally, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate has been reacting to the issue of the bills and a narrowing balance sheet, with the overnight rate jumping 23.68 points to 0.5102 yesterday and the weekly rate hitting 0.5275.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the Hongkong and </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Banking Corp</span><span class="s1"> has responded by maintaining its current lending rate of 5 percent and saving rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US Fed left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday but signaled it still expects one more increase by the end of the year despite a recent bout of low inflation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As expected, the Fed also said it would begin next month to reduce its approximately US$4.2 trillion (HK$32.76 trillion) in holdings of </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> bonds and mortgage-backed securities acquired since the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New economic projections released after the Fed's two-day policy meeting showed 11 of 16 officials see the "appropriate" level for the federal funds rate - the benchmark interest rate - to range between 1.25 and 1.50 percent by year-end, or 0.25 percentage points higher than now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bond yields rose, pushing up the US dollar, but stock indexes were little changed. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note reached 2.29 percent, the highest since August 8, which helped push up bank stock prices.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said at a forum yesterday that Hong Kong will allow foreign investors to tap Shenzhen-listed stocks within one to two weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, Li said the issue is likely to pose a mere short-term risk in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources said the stock exchange operator has booked the local bourse on November 21 for an unspecified event. Asked if the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect will kick off on that date, Li said the launch date is pending an announcement by the authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"All preparation for the connect have been done. We are waiting for a starting gun to be fired, but we do not hold the gun," quipped Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li believes the authorities will announce the launch date at a proper time, which he hope can come on a Sunday for giving the market some time to prepare. Li earlier said that the Shenzhen connect is likely to start trading on a Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said the link to Shenzhen market will not boost mainland capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After mainland investors sell their holdings in Hong Kong, the proceeds will be transferred to their accounts at China Securities Depository and </span><span class="s3">Clearing Corporation</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While foreign investors' money cannot invest in mainland property market following they take profit from their Shenzhen shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The money will be shifted back to their Hong Kong accounts. "Both the Shanghai Connect and the coming Shenzhen Connect are pure investment tools, instead of tools that help capital outflow or inflow," said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong does not expect the Shenzhen Connect to boost turnover of either the Hong Kong or Shenzhen stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Stock connects only offer mainland and foreign investors a channel of cross- border trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is not quite relevant to turnover. Whether investors would like to tap A shares or local shares depends on their view on markets," said CSAHK life honorary president Tse Yung-hoi.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China could cut banks' reserve requirement ratio in the second half because of economic downward pressure and less fiscal policy restriction China Securities News reported yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said the economic data for May was below market expectations, especially in the property sector and in fixed assets investment growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, the export order index has been dropping continuously for three months and exporters may still face challenges after Brexit. But Wu Xiaoling, former vice governor of </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said the efficiency of dumping money is diminishing and the focus should be on structural reform. Wu was speaking at the </span><span class="s3">Boao Forum</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said commercial banks lost their impetus and ability to provide loans after the financial crisis due to rising non-performing loan rate and lower credit financing demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The quantitative easing program did not fix the underlying problem of shrinking consumption and investment motivation. There is a need for technical revolution to push forward corporate development, she said. Activity in China's services sector rose to an 11-month high in June as reflected in the PMI, a private survey showed yesterday, diverging from struggling manufacturing in a trend that if sustainable would signal Beijing's efforts to rebalance its economy is bearing fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow in China has been stable in May compared with the first two months but the mainland market has to keep growing energy to boost investor confidence and prevent further capital outflow, said Fang Shangpu, deputy administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in the forum.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) from Hong Kong companies reached record levels in the first quarter, as firms poured US$15.5 billion into overseas market - the highest total since 2001, Mergemarket data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas M&amp;A activity by mainland companies cooled drastically, however, as government capital outflow controls tightened since the second half of 2016, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies made 80 outbound M&amp;A deals worth US$12.5 billion in the first quarter, compared with US$82 billion during same period last year, while deal count also dropped from 96.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As an offshore financial centre with less influence from the capital outflow controls imposed by Chinese regulators, Hong Kong continues to have robust outbound appetite," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That US$15.5 billion spent by Hong Kong firms involved 23 deals, beating any previous quarters measured by Mergermarket by at least US$ 5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Topping the deals was a US$9.8 billion bid made by a consortium led by </span><span class="s3">Cheung Kong Property</span><span class="s1"> to take over Australia power provider </span><span class="s3">Duet Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That was followed by </span><span class="s3">Chow Tai Fook Enterprises</span><span class="s1">' US$3.1 billion deal to acquire Australian utilities giant </span><span class="s3">Alinta Energy</span><span class="s1">. The two accounted for 83.2 per cent of total outbound value in the first quarter, with a combined US$12.9 billion investment into Australian assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese regulators have been tightening outbound M&amp;A approvals and capital outflow, as the yuan continued to depreciate, since the second half of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In terms of deal nature, those below US$ 5 billion in value would stand a higher chance of getting approved [in China]. Sectors on the watch list of regulators range from real estate to leisure, such as property, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and sports clubs," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest outbound deal from China so far this year was </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">'s US$1.5 billion acquisition of US-based MoneyGram.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was a fraction of the size of largest deals in the first quarters of the last two years, led by ChemChina in their US$ 45.9 billion </span><span class="s3">Syngenta</span><span class="s1"> deal in Q1 2016, and US$ 8.8 billion Pirelli deal in Q1 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Inbound interest by companies from outside of China and Hong Kong in the region has also slowed to the lowest level in in a decade by number of deals, the report shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just 23 deals worth a US$ 3.2 billion were made in the first three months, making it the worst performing quarter since the first quarter in 2004, when only 18 inbound deals totaling US$ 2.2 billion were recorded, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Despite China's open policy for foreign investment, capital outflow controls imposed by the regulators has also affected overseas investor appetite, especially when returning profits from China to overseas shareholders has becomes such a concern," the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new cap ordered by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on the outflow of yuan will not affect the two Stock Connect share trading schemes, that link the Hong Kong stock market with their equivalents in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), or stockbrokers, according to officials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With just days before the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect on Monday, the central bank issued orders to cap the amounts companies can invest overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies cannot now invest more than 30 per cent of their equities stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said they viewed the move as the government's latest effort to prevent capital outflow from the mainland, as many companies and individuals continued investing into overseas assets to escape the devaluation of the yuan, which has fallen 7 per cent this year against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is no fund outflow in the Stock Connect mechanism because fund flow is insulated within a closed loop,” said a spokesman for HKEX.Funds from the sale of shares cannot be used in the market where the shares are listed. This ensures the programme is used exclusively for the purposes of investment activities between the two markets and cannot be used for other purposesHKEX spokesman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Once Hong Kong and international investors sell their A-shares or mainland investors sell Hong Kong shares, money flows back into their home market accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Funds from the sale of shares cannot be used in the market where the shares are listed. This ensures the programme is used exclusively for the purposes of investment activities between the two markets and cannot be used for other purposes,” the HKEX spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which goes live on Monday, is expected to be popular with mainlanders wanting to invest in Hong Kong stocks, especially as the yuan continues to fall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scheme allows international investors to buy into 881 Shenzhen stocks at up to 13 billion yuan a day while mainlanders can invest 417 Hong Kong stocks up to 10.5 billion a day. The daily quota is the same as the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock connect, launched in November 2014.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benny Mau, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, said investment made via the stock connect cannot be taken out the stock markets for other types of investment, so capital outflow is not affected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When mainlanders buy Hong Kong stocks and earn a profit, they can sell their stocks. But then, profits must be returned to their mainland securities accounts while they cannot take the money out to buy properties or other investment in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, investment made via the stock connect will not led to capital outflow,” Mau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s new orders mainly affect cross-border acquisitions, but not Stock Connect investments,” Mau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said even if the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> planned a cap on individual investors, it would be difficult to enforce.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Stock Connect schemes are mainly aimed at individual investors. It would be hard to add a cap on their investment, as the central bank would find it hard to check on each individual's wealth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new orders will not affect trading using Stock Connect. There will still be a lot of mainland investors buying Hong Kong stocks,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has recently expanded its Primary Liquidity Providers scheme, by renewing the terms of the seven banks involved, and adding two more banks with additional bilateral swap lines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is to ensure that the banking system in Hong Kong has the necessary backstop for the purposes of assisting banks in managing their RMB liquidity following the launch of the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Connect,” an HKMA spokesman told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is attractive as a centre for Chinese companies going out in many ways, including its status as a premier offshore RMB hub, simple and competitive tax regime, close proximity to mainland China, full integration with the rest of the world, extensive banking network, first class financial market, professional servicesm” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many Chinese enterprises have already established a business presence in Hong Kong. As they extend their global reach, Hong Kong remains a competitive and attractive platform for them to do so.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Making yuan a global currency can wait. For now Beijing has prioritised stabilising the yuan over everything else, tightening controls over capital outflow to curb speculation that triggered sharp devaluation of the currency this month. But it has not closed the door to the global dream and investors just need to adapt to its new pace.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As capital outflow pressure piles up with the decoupling of monetary policies between China and the US, and expectation for a weaker yuan grows as economic growth slows to the lowest pace in 25 years, China is struggling to rebalance its pace of opening up its capital account, an irreversible commitment it has signed on to by joining the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s elite list of currencies in November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is obviously not moving to a new regime in which suddenly everything becomes market-based. It's not surprising that the government is managing the process. Managing the process means opening the door for a little while, and closing it, and opening again," said Markus Schomer, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">PineBridge Investments.READ</span><span class="s1"> MORE: Offshore yuan interest rate rockets to 200 per cent, with the People's Bank eager to punish speculators</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to KH Heng, senior forex strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking, "It looks like the immediate priority of the Chinese authorities is to stem excessive capital outflow and one-sided speculative bets for yuan depreciation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But I believe that over the long term, over a multi-year horizon, the objective is still internationalisation of the RMB. This is in line with recent efforts for more foreign central banks to trade in onshore foreign exchange market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Doubts have been cast on China's grand plan opening up its capital account after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">unexpectedly pushed up the funding rates on the offshore yuan markets on January 12 and imposed the reserve ratio on foreign banks a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before that, the turmoil on China's yuan market had battered offshore yuan - mainly traded on the free market in Hong Kong - to a five-year low as it plunged to 6.6964 against the US dollar on January 6.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> data show commercial banks sold a net 629 billion yuan (US$95.61 billion) worth of foreign exchange in December, or nearly triple the amount the previous month, as capital outflows grew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, as the central bank continues to fight off speculators, China's foreign exchange reserves are bleeding. Reserves contracted by US$ 513 billion last year to US$3.33 trillion from a peak of US$3.99 trillion in June 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> approved the inclusion of the yuan as the fifth member of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket in November, which is set to take effect this October. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had declared it would reduce intervention in the exchange rate and accelerate the full convertibility of the yuan after the decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Wenjie, a strategist at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">, said it seemed the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is dealing with a new situation since joining the SDR and would step up management of the capital accounts "for a while", but is unlikely to pull back too much. For instance, it is unlikely to scrap the annual quota of US$50,000 for individual Chinese nationals buying foreign currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is trying to figure out what the bottom line of the central bank is. It could be the size of capital outflow or the stability of the exchange rate, or the independence of the exchange rate policies. But obviously, they cannot hold all of the three lines," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opening of the capital markets essentially involves the reallocation of China's investment capital, which will cause net capital outflow and further weaken the yuan, said Schomer at PineBridge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But China did choose a good time to make the move, because it would be much more complicated and damaging if they opened the door when the currency was undervalued...the minute you open the door the currency begins strengthening, and China will have to curb currency appreciation that would strangle exports."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other analysts also broadly argue it would be much more painful and the outflow would be much more aggressive if hot money flooded in when the currency was undervalued. China has avoided that situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Right now, the biggest problem is the fear triggered by yuan's valuation falling too much, which drives volatilities. But this is much easier for China to manage," Schomer said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But one thing that really is in great need for improvement is communication. Investors have been second-guessing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> as the latter has stayed mum and unreachable for almost two weeks amid the sharp devaluation of the yuan since January until it suddenly launched a shock-and-awe attack on yuan short-sellers on January 12.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No senior officials have made any comment or taken questions from media until January 15, when Premier Li Keqiang made an official statement, saying "China has the ability to continue to maintain the yuan exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced standard".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is obviously not used to communicate with the financial markets," said Schomer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We go through the US Fed's statement with extreme scrutiny, looking at where the commas are, at every single word. Everything the US does gets scrutinised under a microscope and China gets the same attention. It's not that China should do the same. It just needs to develop its own style."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ambitious "One Belt, One Road" initiative could face funding problems as a highly likely rate rise from the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> would increase funding costs and China has imposed strict controls on capital outflow lately, an economist said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at South China Morning Post's China Conference on Friday morning, Alicia García Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific from French bank </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1">, said in a panel discussion that it was not sustainable for China to drain its forex reserves to fund large overseas infrastructure projects on the Belt and Road initiative, which left room for Hong Kong to be a alternate source of offshore funding in US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Constraints in US dollar financing are very strong in China now. I think China will look for alliances for the belt and road," Herrero said.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2014, when the Chinese yuan started depreciating, China has lost more than US$800 billion in its foreign reserves, some of which was used to stabilise the yuan's exchange rate as it aims at becoming a global reserve currency. This year, the yuan has faced strong depreciation pressure as the US economy rebounds and a rate rise at the end of this year seems almost certain. Strong depreciation expectation on the yuan has provoked capital outflow, leading Beijing to tighten outbound direct investment and the amount of yuan that Chinese companies can remit overseas.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That makes it [the funding difficulty] even more so. If </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> raises its funding in Hong Kong, and lends it directly to Russia, that's not an outflow for China," Herrero said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, co-panellist Hu Yifan, regional chief investment officer of Greater China at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">, said on the sidelines of the conference that the rising cost of funding overseas infrastructure seemed inevitable as interest rate hikes, such as in the United States, are a trend that is supported by increasing inflation and growth rates globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Cheap funding is likely gone … Relatively speaking, the funding for the belt and road projects that is initiated by policy banks such as </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> is still cheap," Hu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu said it was a misconception to think the government would fund all the projects on the Belt and Road because the private sector, including state-owned enterprises, had shown much interest in taking on these projects as well, and these investment opportunities simply outweighed controls on capital outflow, which was "manageable".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is natural to see the capital outflow from Hong Kong after the US increased its interest rate in December," he said. "It is also because the Hong Kong economy is weak and the stock market has fallen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The HKMA has the ability and sufficient reserves to defend the peg even if some of the US$130 billion capital which has flowed into the Hong Kong markets in recent years leaves. When this money flows out, the Hong Kong dollar would fall and the interest rate would rise. But the process would be gradual and would not be too fast."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said HKMA would sell the US dollar and buy the Hong Kong dollar whenever it fell to the weak end of the peg link at 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar has been weakening since last week when it fell 0.36 per cent against the US dollar, its worst weekly fall in 12 years, due to capital outflow as investors take money out of the city following the rise in US interest rates last month. The stock market slump in Hong Kong and on the mainland since the start of this year has also led investors withdraw money from the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local currency was trading at 7.7968 at 4:30pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, it has not yet reached the level that would require the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to intervene. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar at 7.80, and the HKMA will intervene whenever the currency trades beyond strong end of 7.75 or weak end at 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority spent HK$227.15 billion to weaken the Hong Kong dollar in defence of the peg last year. It is likely to continue the intervention this year, but for a different reason - to prevent it from being too weak. The last time the HKMA had to use its HK$3.27 trillion Exchange Fund to rescue the Hong Kong dollar from being too weak was in 2005.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors are overall very gloomy about the Asian markets as a whole including Hong Kong and China. There's obviously a lot of capital outflow. We are going to see the Hong Kong dollar fall further," said Joseph Tong Tang, executive director of brokerage firm SHK &amp; Co.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves dropped more than expected in August, hitting the lowest level since December 2011, indicating that capital outflow pressures remain a concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forex reserves stood at US$3.185 trillion at the end of last month, down US$15.89 billion from the end of July, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Wednesday. The market consensus was for a US$11 billion decline. The reserves fell US$4.1 billion in July.The data showed capital outflow pressure remained on expectation of further yuan depreciationLiu Jian, senior researcher, Bank of Communications</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The data showed capital outflow pressure remained on expectation of further yuan depreciation," said Liu Jian, a senior researcher at the Bank of Communications. "A faster depreciation of the yuan in late August may quicken the outflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said pressure on outflows would remain for the rest of the year as a gradual depreciation of the yuan was widely expected, although the pressure was smaller than what was seen last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China unexpectedly devalued the yuan by 2 per cent in August last year, triggering a flood of capital outflows over fears of a sharp further depreciation. The reserves fell by US$513 billion last year. China has already introduced tighter controls on capital outflows to put a brake on the drop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested continued intervention by the central bank and outflows remained sizeable. "The key takeaway is that although concerns about China are no longer front-page news, capital outflow pressures haven't gone away," he wrote in a note.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said that as the mainland's yuan currency continued to weaken against the US dollar and its foreign exchange reserves shrank further, the authorities were expected to become increasingly hostile to overseas deals by mainland companies and to impose more regulatory scrutiny and foreign exchange checks on mainland investors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange regulator has pledged to up the ante in its clampdown of what it calls “fake” overseas investments, after some individuals and companies were found to be using false deals to move assets out of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But officials insist capital outflow levels are easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo Song, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) director-general of Capital Account Management, said on Thursday that in the past year it had found cases of assets being moved overseas, which were falsely claimed as being for mergers or acquisitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aggressive outbound deals by wealthy Chinese have been encouraged by the government, as part of its “going global” economic initiatives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts say that in some cases, aggressive outbound deals pushed by deep-pocketed Chinese buyers, have proved little more than ways of moving their money outside of the country, amid an economic slowdown and a weakening yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's outbound direct investment spiked at US$102.75 billion (HK$796.92 billion) in the first seven months, a 61.8 per cent year-on-year surge. Foreign direct investment into the country rose just 4.3 per cent year on year to $77.13 billion in the same period, official data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo said no large amounts of capital outflow via fake investment deals has been detected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We support genuine outbound investment that follows the rules, but we will maintain a strict crack down on fake methods...it is a key concern,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for the latest wave of US-listed Chinese companies seeking listed status in the mainland, Guo said SAFE would support their currency exchange demands to delist from the US market, but “will avoid companies with arbitrage intentions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 30 US-listed Chinese companies are pushing for privatisation in the US and eyeing a relisting in the domestic A-share market.We support genuine outbound investment that follows the rules, but we will maintain a strict crack down on fake methods...it is a key concernGuo Song, spokesman, </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A key motivator behind the wave is the higher valuations of listed companies in China. But the privatisations often require large amounts of currency to be exchanged denominated in US dollars, which could further drain China's declining foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guo said SAFE would support “normal outbound merger and acquisition deals, but would also maintain the balance of income and expense”, and noted the pressures on capital outflow was easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves dropped to their lowest since January 2012 in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar value of the reserves decreased by US$15.9 billion to US$3.19 trillion in August, following a small decline of US$4.1 billion in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said China's capital outflows had two primary drivers - the unwinding of carry positions and the purchase of foreign assets by Chinese residents and companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Iris Pang, an analyst with </span><span class="s3">Natixis</span><span class="s1">, said strong motivation still exists, particularly for the second type.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People and companies in China have a strong desire to allocate part of their wealth to overseas markets, as domestic investment returns decline and the property market becomes increasingly frothy and risky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The outlook of the yuan has dampened as the US heads for possible interest rate hikes by the end of this year, and suggests more hawkish moves next year,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Larry Hu and Jerry Peng, analysts with Macquarie, said capital controls “are more effective” against the second type of capital flight, which is largely domestic money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For carry trade unwinding or hot money flows, it's much harder to control as it's all foreign money,” they said in a research note issued Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, they said hot money is not unlimited, estimating 60 per cent of the US$742 billion carry trade inflows from the first quarter in 2009 to mid-2014 had already left.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, the pressure on capital outflow has eased lately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some domestic residents still have the motivation to move money overseas, but that's much easier for the regulator to control.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Restrictions aimed at controlling how Chinese companies and individuals deploy capital overseas will make it difficult for them to invest in businesses not aligned with domestic consumer demand, such as pharmaceuticals, and prioritise industries for the government including advanced manufacturing, Xu Chen, Chairman of the US chapter of the </span><span class="s3">China General Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> (CGCC), told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"From July, [</span><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, or SAFE] will continue to further tighten capital outflow from China and this is very important to the EB-5 program," Xu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's reasonable for China to tighten restrictions on the capital outflow into [the real estate] market" because Chinese investment in this sector had surged too quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the meantime, China's central government, central bank and also the foreign exchange control authorities are encouraging the capital outflow in the market closely related to the consumption demand in China's market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sometimes referred to as the "golden visa programme", the HB-5 programme allows foreigners investing as little as US$500,000 in a qualifying real estate projects to apply for permanent residency. Qualification for projects approved for the $500,000 minimum investment level is limited to those in areas of high unemployment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cases of fraud in EB-5 projects and questions over how some projects in high-rent areas received their qualifications prompted US senators, including California's Dianne Feinstein and Iowa's Chuck Grassley, to call for the elimination of the programme.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">News that a property developer owned by the family of US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has raised funds for a high-rise project near Manhattan through the EB-5 programme increased public scrutiny. That attention peaked when Kushner's sister touted her family's ties to Trump to attract more investors during presentations in China last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors from mainland China have accounted for more than three quarters of the EB-5 visas issued in recent years, particularly since the financial crisis of 2008, when more traditional forms of credit for real estate projects dried up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CGCC's Xu said banks in Hong Kong and Macau will step up supervision of funds remitted to the US to ensure they don't violate SAFE's policies. Moreover, he said, the Trump administration's focus on restricting immigration may further restrict the ability of banks and other intermediaries involved in pooling EB-5 investments for property developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xu's comments about China's control over investment outflows highlighted insights from a CGCC survey of its US membership, particularly the degree to which this is affecting their investment plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The recent tightening of outbound investment oversight by the Chinese government has affected 54 per cent of the surveyed companies' investment plans," according to the CGCC's just-published report of survey results. "Among these affected companies, 80 per cent say the change has increased the time for getting approvals, and 78 per cent say it has made it more difficult to obtain approvals."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital outflow controls appear to be a more pressing issue for the CGCC's US chapter members than restrictions they face in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sixty-five per cent of the survey's respondents "consider the implementation of US policies and rules to be unbiased", the survey report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts warn of hot money outflows from Hong Kong that could negatively affect the equity and property markets if the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> initiates its first rate-tightening cycle in nearly nine years this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the US adopted it aggressive monetary easing policy in 2008, about US$110 billion worth of funds has flowed into the local equity and property markets, according to the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those funds, however, could head for the exit if US interest rates begin to ratchet higher on a path towards policy normalisation, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norman Chan Tak-lam, chief executive of the HKMA cautioned in September that higher US rates "may lead to some capital outflow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher rates would bring about an end to the low interest rate environment, a mirror image of the conditions that brought waves of capital to Hong Kong shores in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joe Tong Tang, executive director of </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1">, said the outflow of hot money started over the last few months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market has expected that the US would increase the interest rate in the second half of this year, while the mainland economy and stock markets were not performing well. This has led investors to withdraw from the market, which explains why the stock market turnover is so low recently," Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock market turnover on Thursday stood at only HK$69.50 billion, compared with an average daily turnover of HK$109.9 billion in the first 11 months this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for financial services sector who is a broker, shared the view.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock market sentiment is so weak recently as investors are worried the interest rate rise will led to capital outflow. This will continue for some time as the US is likely to continue to increase the interest rate next year," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong Man-bun, an executive director and head of research in </span><span class="s3">KGI Asia</span><span class="s1">, agreed that there will likely be additional capital outflows in coming quarters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If the US increases the interest rate frequently next year, money invested in Asia in the past few years would likely flow back to the US markets," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Gary Cheung Wai-kwok, the chief executive of Tung Shing Futures, said the market has already discounted the US rate rise and as a result, he believes the market may bounce back even if the Fed tightens as many analysts expect. "The market sentiment may improve after the rate rise as it clears up uncertainty," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US interest rates have been frozen since 2006, reflecting the longest pause in its modern history. In an another low-interest rate period during the 1990s, the Fed held the target rate at 3 per cent for 17 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analyst expects the interest rate will increase by 25 basis points this week, while tightening could take place in larger moves more next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Bank executive director Andrew Fung said the rate rise is likely to be more gentle than in previous cycles and he thus believes outflows will also be softer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, the capital outflow can be triggered by other factors too, such as relatively weaker share market," Fung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Reorient Group, said the local property market will get hit by the rate rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong real estate market will get hit as the dollar peg and tightening will move up mortgage rates and make property less attractive," McGonegal said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan strengthened against the US dollar for a second day on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the spot market in Shanghai, the US dollar bought 6.88 yuan at 2pm, down 0.03 per cent from 6.8822 late Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the offshore yuan also rose, as the dollar traded at 6.8801 yuan compared with 6.8845 in the prior session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier in the day, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan's mid-point rate at 6.8823 per US dollar, down 31 basis points from the previous day. It marked a second day for the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to weaken the fixing rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow conditions have stabilised in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese banks sold a net 48.3 billion yuan (US$7 billion) in spot foreign exchange settlements in March, the lowest level since mid-August, according to recent government statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Following the stabilisation of foreign exchange (FX) reserves and RMB exchange rate, the decline in net FX settlement deficit was not surprising, but confirmed easing capital outflow pressure," said Ken Cheung Kin Tai, Asian forex strategist at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If China started to relax its capital outflow controls, we look for further cross-border RMB flows to offshore market, which were being suppressed since the fourth quarter 2016."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expected the offshore yuan to face downward pressure as offshore liquidity conditions continue to improve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In afternoon trade, the euro firmed slightly against the greenback, up 0.01 per cent to US$1.0718, ahead of the first round of the French elections on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The British pound dropped 0.1 per cent to US$1.2812.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose for the 12th consecutive month on the back of a weakening dollar and tough capital controls, according to official data released on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves grew US$21.5 billion in January to hit US$3.16 trillion, the highest since October 2016, </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> figures showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The monthly growth in January, which was bigger than an increase of US$20.2 billion in December, came amid China's strict capital account controls and a strengthening yuan, which is at its highest level against the US dollar since August 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China does not face much pressure from capital outflow for now,” said Hong Hao , chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bocom International Holdings</span><span class="s1"> . “Pretty much all the loopholes in the capital control scheme have been plugged.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex new year resolution: hit illegal currency outflows hard in 2018 [http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2132140/chinas-forex-new-year-resolution-hit-illegal-currency-outflows]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has introduced a series of capital control policies in the past two years, including tighter scrutiny of individual purchases of insurance plans abroad and of overseas asset acquisitions by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government was unlikely to relax its grip, Hong said, because the measures were a key reason the foreign exchange reserves had stabilised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is long-term demand driving capital outflow because as China's economy matures, people want to diversify their asset portfolios and buy overseas assets,” said Claire Huang, a China economist at Societe Generale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement that the reserves rose in January thanks to appreciation of non-dollar currencies in the portfolio, and China would see “more balanced” cross-border capital flows in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, the central bank reiterated its determination to “prevent cross-border capital flow risks” and “clamp down harshly on foreign currency crimes”, including underground banks helping Chinese move their money overseas, in a statement following its 2018 working meeting.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing regards capital outflow as a major threat to economic and financial stability after China lost about US$1 trillion in its foreign exchange reserves from mid-2014 to early 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese individuals can purchase US$50,000 worth of foreign currency each year, an annual quota that was renewed on January 1.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang noted that US dollar-denominated forex reserves may have been inflated by the weakened dollar because it pushed up the US dollar value of euro and yen assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The valuation effect played a large role in the rise of forex reserves this year,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the yuan strengthening more than 5 per cent against the US dollar in the past three months, the government was unlikely to lend support to lift the currency any further, Hong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a delicate balance - neither too much appreciation or depreciation is good for China's economy,” Hong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An even stronger yuan would hurt Chinese exports and raise the costs of its economic structural reform, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forex reserves rose for the whole year in 2017, the first time since 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.4 per cent, or 625.8 points, to 25,601.92, the largest daily loss since October 23. The gauge declined 3.3 per cent for the week - the worst performance in a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index declined 2.1 per cent, or 224.75 points, to 10,478.84.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, stocks also trended lower in Shanghai and Shenzhen, recording a five-day losing streak. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.4 per cent to 2,598.97, and the Shenzhen Composite Index shed 0.4 per cent to 1,328.19.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US policymaking Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at between 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent on Thursday, fuelling expectations it would approve the fourth rate hike of this year in December.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is worried that capital will flow out of China, because the expected rate hike is likely to further weaken the Chinese yuan,” said Kingston Lin King-ham, director of securities brokerage AMTD.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial stocks led the decline in both mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, after China's financial regulator outlined targets for banks to increase lending to private companies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese capital outflow decreased in the first half of 2016, although deals in the latter part of the year will lift outbound investment to the same levels as last year, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new report from Knight Frank Research says this year has seen "waves of Chinese outbound capital" worth US$10.7 billion (HK$83 billion), a 13.6 per cent drop from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it added the first six months of 2015 provided a high base for comparison, since there were historically large real estate deals such as </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s US$1.95 billion purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese investment was gaining momentum as we crossed the half-year mark," the report said. "Since June there have been deals in the making that promise to turn 2016 into another productive year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China's economy has slowed recently, the country's investors remain interested in global markets, particularly in primary real estate, its analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">High land prices in Chinese cities - for which the government has recently rolled out cooling measures to temper overheating markets - "has encourage capital to seek overseas opportunities," Knight Frank they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite strong outbound investment, analysts warn existing restrictions on China's foreign exchange reserves could cause money to dry up in the overseas subsidiaries of Chinese investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although China's capital outflow control has been a push factor so far, it could be a double-edged sword," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investment in properties abroad has ballooned in recent years, escalating from US$5.6 billion in 2012 to US$34.4 billion last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And tangible assets such as real estate have been more attractive as speculation continues as to when the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will raise interest rates, and as the renminbi has continued to weaken.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"[This] has resulted in a sense of urgency for Chinese investors to invest in USD-denominated assets," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US remains the top destination for Chinese capital, garnering US$5.1 billion in the first half, a 21 per cent increase from the same period last year. In particular, 80 per cent of Chinese investments in the US were in New York, according to </span><span class="s3">Real Capital Analytics</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And most of the capital outflow went into office deals as Chinese institutional capital "continued to chase trophy assets," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Life Insurance</span><span class="s1"> bought the PaineWebber Building in New York for US$1.65 billion and </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> paid US$700 million for an office at One New York Plaza.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The UK also saw a "whopping 75 per cent uptick" in Chinese capital in the first half compared to last year, or US$1.7 billion, particularly from private banks and conglomerates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"London's status as a key international financial centre and the perceived stability of the UK economy definitely contributed to this tremendous growth," the report said.London's status as a key international financial centre and the perceived stability of the UK economy definitely contributed to this tremendous growthKnight Frank Research report</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even following the Brexit vote in June, analysts say interest in London "seems undiminished."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Minsheng Investment Corp</span><span class="s1">, one of the country's largest private investment conglomerates, bought </span><span class="s3">Societe Generale</span><span class="s1">'s London headquarters for US$110 million in September, and </span><span class="s3">China Vanke Co</span><span class="s1"> forked out US$149 million to acquire London's Ryder Court office building.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was also a sizeable market for Chinese funds in the first half, bringing in US$1.68 billion, just 9 per cent less than last year. Increasing connectivity between Hong Kong and mainland markets through stock connects have attracted "new tenant demand," analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As Hong Kong office rents remain the highest in the world, any opportunity to own a trophy Grade A office asset in the central business district cannot be ignored," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additionally, Hong Kong's residential land market offers "better opportunity than some of the hotly contested mainland markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Australia saw a 37 per cent decline in Chinese capital to US$1.7 billion in the first half, although interest remains in office markets in Sydney and Melbourne.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong) </span><span class="s1">expects the city's yuan deposits to keep growing despite capital outflow risks, reaching 1.16 trillion yuan (HK$1.48 trillion) by the end of this year, driven by the prospect of steady appreciation in the currency and increasing overseas investments by mainlanders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yang Ruhai, the general manager and head of yuan business at </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1">, the sole clearing bank for yuan business in Hong Kong, said he expected deposits of the currency in Hong Kong would grow by as much as 300 billion yuan this year, compared with 260 billion yuan last year. Even if tapering triggers capital outflow … the yuan will still [appreciate] YANG RUHAI, </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We see the growth maintaining last year's momentum, although we do not see any reason to support faster growth, thanks to the exit of quantitative easing in the US," Yang said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he expected the yuan to appreciate by between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent against the US dollar this year, down from last year's 3 per cent increase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another factor offsetting the negative impact of US tapering would be the rapid growth in yuan outward direct investment, which is expected to see more mainland firms shift their onshore yuan capital to Hong Kong, which has been serving as the platform for mainland enterprises to go abroad, Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing launched a pilot outward direct investment scheme in January 2011, allowing mainland firms to conduct direct investments overseas using yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The volume totalled 80 billion yuan last year, compared with 30 billion yuan in 2012, Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the US Federal Reserve reins in its quantitative easing programme, capital that was invested in developing economies where rates were higher is starting to flow back to developed markets as interest rates begin to rise there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet compared with other emerging market currencies - which have been taking a heavy beating from the strengthening of the US dollar - the yuan could be a bright spot in the emerging currency basket this year, Yang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the US tapering triggers capital outflow and the US dollar strengthens, the yuan will still be steadily on an appreciation track," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, the world's largest holder of foreign reserves, saw its pool of foreign assets decline for the first time in more than a decade, triggering worries about an unbridled capital outflow that could adversely affect the mainland economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's foreign reserves stood at US$3.181 trillion at the end of December, down from US$3.2 trillion on September 30, according to the People's Bank of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A quarterly drop in China's foreign reserves has not been seen since 1998, when rampant capital outflow occurred in the Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves reached a record US$3.27 trillion in October and then dwindled by US$52.89 billion in November and by US$39.76 billion in December, the first time the figure fell for two consecutive months since the first quarter of 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lack of transparency in China has made it difficult to clearly explain the reasons for the drop, but economists said the increase in rich mainlanders transferring their assets abroad definitely played an important role in the reduction of foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's economy, capitalising on a huge trade surplus and ever-increasing foreign direct investments, has been on a growth fast track over the past two decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thousands of entrepreneurs amassed fortunes as their businesses secured massive overseas orders for everything from shoes and cigarette lighters to leather bags.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, concerns about potential political instability and the sustainability of their businesses prompted many rich people to place part of their money in foreign countries where personal wealth is better protected under democratic systems of government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I've seen an increasing number of entrepreneurs planning to transfer their fortunes abroad because they want to seek a safe haven for their money," said Xiao Zhixing, an associate professor of management at the China Europe International Business School. "Well-educated rich people, in particular, are desperate to do so."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China still has tight controls on cross-border capital flow, although in recent years the government encouraged outbound investments by state-owned institutions and companies as a way of easing inflationary pressure on the domestic economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Privately-owned enterprises or their owners cannot transfer assets abroad and outbound direct investments overseas are subject to strict, lengthy reviews by the authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A typical method used by super-rich mainlanders to bypass these rules is to falsify import deals so they exchange yuan into foreign currencies to buy the "inbound shipments".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The problem doesn't seem very serious now since the government's regulations on fund inflow are still working," said Yi Xianrong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "But the quarterly fall could be a sign that the trend has reversed. China's foreign reserves might start dropping as it is no longer able to achieve a huge trade surplus."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland has long been under pressure to revalue its currency as Western countries accuse it of keeping the yuan artificially cheaper to ensure Chinese-made goods cost less in foreign markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan continued to strengthen last year as the central bank pushed its appreciation through daily fixing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's Commerce Minister Chen Deming said earlier this month the full-year trade surplus in 2011 would narrow 14.5 per cent from a year earlier to US$155.14 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some economists said the capital outflow was also a result of predictions that the yuan had peaked following its constant appreciation since June 2010 when Beijing lifted its de facto peg to the US dollar.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital outflows will continue in the near term even in the light of an increase of foreign exchange reserves in March because both investors and companies want to diversify their assets, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not expect a quick reversal of capital outflows," Standard Chartered analysts Ding Shuang and Yan Se said in a note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves in March climbed by US$10.26 billion, the first monthly gain since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese households are likely to diversify their investments and increase their foreign asset holdings, Ding and Yan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of 2015, total Chinese outbound real-estate investment had reached nearly US$30 billion, twice that of 2014, as both individuals and institutions invested in Sydney, London and Manhattan to diversify their assets amid the depreciation of the yuan and stock market turbulence, research by property consultant Knight Frank showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A greater contributor of capital outflows is from mainland companies investing in and acquiring western firms. Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group said earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It agreed to buy Dead Sea cosmetics manufacturer </span><span class="s3">Ahava</span><span class="s1"> for US$77 million because it saw increased demand for personal care products in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Chicago Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> agreed in February to be acquired by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, — a deal still pending regulator approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An increasing share of outbound flows is now focused on acquiring assets that provide long-term income, access to new markets and better technologies, rather than just mining and natural resources, a report by HSBC Global Research said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe China's outward direct investment (ODI) will continue to grow despite — or even because of — the domestic economic slowdown as the country looks to diversify its savings into foreign assets," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's non-financial direct investment overseas reached 261.74 billion yuan (HK$312.94 billion) in the first quarter of this year, up 55.4 per cent annually, the Ministry of Commerce said. In March, the newly added investment surged 21.5 per cent year-on-year to 66.4 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly all of China's ODI are settled in yuan, and this particular kind of capital outflow is an important channel for yuan's internationalisation, the </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The depreciation trend of China's "red back", still, is the substantial driver for continuous capital outflow, Michael Every, </span><span class="s3">Rabobank</span><span class="s1">'s head of Financial Markets Research at Asia Pacific, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is a structural outflow that will stay until the onshore yuan finds a realistic level much lower than here, Every said. "Mergers and acquisitions will speed this process up."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Monetary Authority of Macau's ATM withdrawal cut is understood to be a reaction to attempts by illicit money movers to circumvent Beijing's move at the beginning of this year to cap at 100,000 yuan (HK$112,600) the annual amount that UnionPay cardholders could withdraw.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority has so far not responded to questions from the Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The authorities have decided it is time to act, and Beijing is backing the move.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two years ago, Beijing put the squeeze on the multi-billion yuan flow of illicit cash through Macau by imposing a crackdown on the use of UnionPay point of service machines, which were being used to disguise overseas transactions as local mainland ones.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The larger-than-expected decline in the world's biggest stockpile of foreign exchange exposed the flaws in Beijing's current ­approach of selling state reserves to support the yuan and was likely to force the authorities to take a stricter line on outbound investment and payments, analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Improvements to China's financial market, such as a market-driven interest rate system, are needed to help the yuan's continued push towards becoming a global currency, senior economists say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin Zhongxia, a former director general of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s Research Institute, who is now China's executive director at the International Monetary Fund, told a forum on Wednesday that bold moves were needed so that the value of the yuan could move more freely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There also needed to be a more open-minded approach regarding capital outflow, he told the forum, organised jointly by the National School of Development of </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1"> and China Business News.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International Monetary Fund approves reserve currency status for China's yuan[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1885369/chinas-yuan-inclusion-imfs-sdr-basket-tipped-put-more-pressure]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Beijing's global plans for the yuan suffered a setback last year after market fears caused by a hefty depreciation in the value of the currency, massive capital transfers and a tightening of financial controls by officials to try to control the yuan's value and halt the outflows.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yang, a former deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the forum that last year's exchange-rate turmoil involving the yuan"was rooted in a non-market-based interest-rate system at home".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said China had removed the minimum price level on lending rates and the upper limit on deposit rates, but the authorities had yet to work out unified and broadly accepted interest-rate benchmarks, he said at the forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the measures to manage liquidity conditions were "redistribution instruments rather than market-decided adjustment".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Efforts were needed to introduce market forces, which would reduce distortion and risks involving interest rates and increase a willingness among people abroad to hold yuan assets, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s Executive Board, which represents the fund's 188 member nations, agreed to include the yuan as the fifth currency, along with the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling, making up its Special Drawing Right (SDR) - an international reserve asset that supplements the official reserves of its member countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/06/10/d7404fd8-2ed1-11e6-8fea-29444b868b1c_image_hires.JPG]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, said in December: "The Executive Board's decision to include the [yuan] in the SDR basket is an important milestone in the integration of the Chinese economy into the global financial system.The [</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">] Executive Board's decision to include the [yuan] ... is an important milestone in the integration of the Chinese economy into the global financial system.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any change to the basket will take effect on October 1, with the yuan having a 10.92 per cent weighting in the basket, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang Yiping, a professor of economics at Peking University's National School of Development, and a member of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s (</span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">) Monetary Policy Committee, said it was important to address domestic problems in interest rates and financial defaults in order to reduce risks when opening a capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The direction of the yuan's globalisation won't change," Huang said. "But a lot of work has to do at home when the yuan goes global."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">, ended its soft peg to the dollar last August 11, by devaluing the yuan nearly 3 per cent and reforming the yuan to fluctuate against a basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the panicked reaction of the market, amid a hefty deprecation in the yuan, forced the central bank back into a de facto peg to the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Later concerns about an economic slowdown in China and expectations about the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> introducing interest rates exacerbated capital outflows from the mainland and triggered an offshore depreciation in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank intervened heavily in the offshore market to defend the currency, such as draining offshore yuan levels and tightening outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/06/10/cbbd221c-2ed1-11e6-8fea-29444b868b1c_image_hires.JPG]China's foreign exchange reserves fell by a record US$500 billion in 2015.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin said a change of mindset was needed regarding capital transfers out of the mainland. "There is no need to be too sensitive about outflows," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Fear is caused by the lack of understanding - not just among ourselves, but others as well," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Premier Li Keqiang reiterated this week that China was not intending to launch a currency war and was able to keep a stable yuan at a "reasonable and balanced" level. But there may be a few clues about how the central bank will do this.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma Jun, chief economist at the central bank's research bureau, said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> might allow the yuan to depreciate or appreciate against the basket of currencies over the long run while reducing short-term volatility.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jin called for a full assessment of China's current exchange rate policy, at a time when its counterparts in the eurozone and Japan had adopted a policy of negative interest rates to shore up their economies. Such policies had weakened the euro and Japanese yen, which had, therefore, pushed up the strngth of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that in the past China had kept its promise not to devalue the yuan to show its support for the region during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and 1998, but that China had then suffered severe deflation in later years and struggled with pressure for reforms and massive lay-offs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That was connected to exchange rate policy," Jin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, deflation in China's producer price index (PPI) - measuring the average change in selling prices of domestic producers of goods and services - has last 51 consecutive months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Along with the high debt burden, the negative PPI has pushed up the real interest rate for enterprises, which will face more difficulties during the country's efforts at deleveraging.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA) has instructed local banks to submit data of cash withdrawals by UnionPay cards through the city's automated teller machines (ATMs), as the regulator cracks down on unauthorised capital outflow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commercial banks must submit data and documentation regarding the volume and time of the withdrawals by UnionPay cards for the first six months of 2017 to the regulator this week, according to a notice cited by the Apple Daily newspaper. An HKMA spokesperson declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move, following a similar step up in enforcement in May by Macau's monetary authorities, closes a loophole in China's capital remittance regulations, that has thus far focused on the ability by companies to transfer money out of the country, said </span><span class="s3">ING Bank NV</span><span class="s1">'s economist Iris Pang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is obviously to deter capital outflow from individuals that use ATMs,” Pang said in Hong Kong. “This signals that the State Administration of Foreign Exchanges (SAFE) is still wary of capital outflows, even though it has slowed down in terms of banks selling renminbi on their clients' behalf.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's authorities had been stepping up regulations since last year, when a deterioration in the renminbi's value led to widespread capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese individuals are allowed to withdraw up to 100,000 yuan (US$15,737) of renminbi from overseas, and are able to remit up to US$50,000 worth of foreign currency offshore, according to the country's 2016 foreign exchange regulations. Users of UnionPay cards can withdraw up to 10,000 yuan everyday, per card.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To skirt around the foreign exchange controls, some individuals had been using separate ATM cards to make cash withdrawals, prompting the regulators to crack down on the practice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Chinese regulators instructed mainland banks to report on a daily basis any offshore bank card withdrawals, and bank transactions exceeding 1,000 yuan (US$148) starting from August 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Macau government announced in May it would instruct all banks to tighten their compliance measures, known as “Know Your Customer (KYC)” procedures and systems, into all ATMs in the city to deter cash withdrawals that exceeded China's capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, Macau instructed mainland Chinese holders of UnionPay cards to have their identity cards and faces scanned by facial recognition systems before they can withdraw money on ATMs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA “is constantly enhancing the overall level of security of the financial system, including studying the feasibility, stability and cost efficiency of biometric accreditation technology including facial recognition,” an HKMA spokesperson said, adding that the monetary authority did not have plans to instruct ATMs in Hong Kong to be equipped with facial recognition capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The data and materials are easily available to Hong Kong banks,” said Pang. “In terms of feasibility, I do not think it hard for them to shift to a Macau style scrutinising model.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect China to continue selling its dollar holdings but a mass sell-off may be unlikely as it is more important for China to keep ample firepower and maintain dollar reserves above the safety line to prevent a potential confidence crisis and safeguard economic stability.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan last month depreciated 1.7 per cent against the US dollar, ending the month at 6.8894 per US unit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the same month, China's foreign reserves declined by US$69.1 billion to US$3.05 trillion, the lowest level since March 2011. It was also the biggest reduction in a month since January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of China's foreign reserves are held in US dollar-denominated assets such as US Treasuries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> analysts said in a recent research note: "The sentiment has deteriorated in recent months, especially when it appears that two sensitive thresholds will be breached soon: 7.00 for USD/CNY exchange rate and US$3 trillion for FX reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A re-enforcing mechanism between sentiment deterioration for domestic investors, capital outflow and currency depreciation pressure is the big challenge faced by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> in the very near term, especially if USD strength continues," they said.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its benchmark rate last week and added one rate increase to its outlook for next year, expectations for a stronger dollar have risen further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Innes said: "With the USD expected to strengthen into year end, the feedback looks accelerated, leaving the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> with little option to burn through reserves to stem the tide."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, despite expectations that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would continue reducing US debt holdings, a mass sell-off seemed unlikely, analysts said, as reducing the reserves to below the safety line may cause a potential confidence crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1"> analysts said US$3 trillion for foreign reserves was a "psychologically important" threshold for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the threshold was breached investors may become more alarmed about China's ability to defend the currency, resulting in huge capital-outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bloomberg Intelligence economists Fielding Chen and Tom Orlik said that, according to methodology developed by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> earlier this year, China needs to hold US$2.9 trillion in reserves to provide enough buffer should its capital control measures be ineffective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu Yongding, a former adviser to the PBOC and senior fellow at top government think-tank the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1">, said in a public speech in Beijing on Sunday: "The most critical issue for China is to maintain the foreign reserves, not maintaining a steady exchange rate.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese offshore property investments fell 30 per cent on year to US$3.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with a 35 per cent growth during the whole of 2015, according to data from global property firm JLL.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More Chinese companies are actively seeking to diversify their assets by making investments overseas, especially in the property sector, after the yuan started depreciating in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they face increased hurdles to take money overseas as deals are subject to closer scrutiny by China's foreign exchange regulator which wants to avoid short-term exchange rate fluctuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This did impact investment confidence,” Guan said, adding that regulators are paying more attention to details, such as whether the target property is overpriced and are also monitoring investors' track record in overseas acquisitions.Increased outward remittances could also slow down the processAlbert Lau, chief executive, Savills China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance Group</span><span class="s1"> dropped a plan to take over hotel giant Starwood in late March, for unknown reasons. Foreign media, however, said that the Chinese government has been pressuring insurers to temper their purchases this year in a bid to slow the rapid flow of money to foreign markets. Anbang was one of the most aggressive buyers of overseas firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some property developers have also complained that it has become difficult for firms to move money for overseas deals since late 2015. Every capital outflow of over US$50 million is now subject to approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Albert Lau, chief executive at property consultancy </span><span class="s3">Savills</span><span class="s1"> China, said some of the capital outflow problems are due to the existing bank transfer system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Increased outward remittances could also slow down the process,” he said.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That said, Chinese companies' willingness to invest in overseas markets still remains strong this year, despite the slowing economy and an oversupplied property market, said Xiong Jin, an international partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons, which specialises in cross-border mergers and acquisitions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But some deals do fail because of capital outflow controls” he said. Overall, the government is still encouraging overseas investment, but does not want to end up with just capital flight, said Xiong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The risk is predictable,. Firms must hold thorough discussions with regulators to make sure the process is smooth before entering into any agreements,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau's gaming revenues are poised to end a multi-year losing streak this year - but experts still warn the central government's ongoing tightening capital controls could threaten the world's largest gambling hub's pace of recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say the strengthening monetary regulations could deal a blow to the enclave's US$30 billion gambling industry, which is seven times the size of Las Vegas and has started to see some encouraging green shoots of recovery after two years of tumbling revenues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those tougher times have been blamed on President Xi Jinping's sweeping crackdown on excessive spending by state officials, that looks to have scared off high-rolling punters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gambling revenue dropped 3.3 per cent in 2016 to 223.2 billion patacas (HK$216.67 billion), the slowest decline in two years. But thousands of tourists have flocked to two newly-opened casino resorts in the former Portuguese colony in the past three months, according to data from the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau released on Sunday.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe the Macau cycle has turned, and 2017 could show a 10 per cent gross gaming revenue growth - the first in four years,” said </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> gaming analysts including Praveen Choudhary and Alex Poon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dramatic fall in its recent gambling revenue has forced Macau to shift its focus to attract more mass-market guests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the bridge to Hong Kong, a permanent Taipa ferry terminal and a rail link to Zhuhai airport, should make Macau more accessible,” wrote </span><span class="s3">Fitch Ratings</span><span class="s1"> analysts led by Alex Bumbazhny in a December note.We think the risks of more capital outflow control measures should not be ignored and will potentially prevent a robust gaming revenue recovery north of mid-single-digit growth next yearChelsey Tam, Morningstar analyst</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A wave of new resort openings by MGM China and SJM in 2017 are also expected to spur tourist visitor flows, they say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's recent moves to tighten the screws on yuan remittances, however, to stem what have become worrying levels of capital flight and stabilise the country's depreciating currency, have heightened concerns that those could stall the industry's recent growth momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We think the risks of more capital outflow control measures should not be ignored and will potentially prevent a robust gaming revenue recovery north of mid-single-digit growth next year,”said Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, Macau monetary chiefs imposed new restrictions on the amount of cash people using mainland-issued China Union Pay bank cards to withdraw cash from ATM machines in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Meaningful depreciation of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar could also trigger more capital outflow control measures,” said Choudhary.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past few years, Macau regulators have launched various crackdowns on underground banks and pawnshops using </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> point-of-sale terminals to illegally spirit cash out of the mainland, in an effort to stem capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau's monthly gambling revenues returned to growth in August, posting their strongest gain in three years in November thanks to the openings of Wynn Macau's Wynn Palace and Sands China's The Parisian projects, that proved instant magnets for mainland holidaymakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising income also helped Macau end a two-year overall economic contraction, lifting its gross domestic product by four per cent in the third quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many investors took to the sidelines in Hong Kong yesterday " a fact illustrated by the Hang Seng Index gaining 63 points to reach 20,504 but turnover remaining modest at just above HK$51.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coal and railway-building shares led the advance.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China prefers a weaker dollar. For a stronger yuan can arrest capital outflow and restore investor confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment banks in Hong Kong may also be looking for a stronger yuan to lift their underwriting businesses.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers saw the dim sum market becoming active last month and expect more people to return later this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Exchange Fund, which is used to back the Hong Kong dollar, posted an investment income of HK$26.1 billion in the first quarter, a year-on-year drop of 59.78 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said yesterday it was the worst performance in five quarters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figure compared with a HK$64.9 billion investment gain in the same period a year earlier, and investment income of HK$66 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, the Exchange Fund saw its investment income hit an adjusted record high HK$264 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Income from Hong Kong equities was HK$1.7 billion in the first quarter, slumping 88.11 percent compared with a year before, while other equities saw a loss of HK$7.4 billion compared to an income of HK$24.5 billion in the same period last year. It gained HK$5.5 billion from bonds and HK$26.3 billion for forex trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Last year we achieved an unprecedented high level of profits but this year we are facing uncertainties in the financial market," HKMA chief executive Norman Chan told reporters, citing interest rates rising faster than expected, intensifying trade conflict between China and the United States, and tension in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA is the key manager of the Exchange Fund, which is under the control of the financial secretary and invests in equities, bonds, foreign exchange and other securities and assets. Commenting on the recent capital outflow, Chan said a widening spread between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar's interest rates attracted arbitrage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Capital flowing out from the Hong Kong dollar will allow Hong Kong dollar interest rates to eventually normalize like the US dollar," Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yesterday morning the Hong Kong dollar hit 7.85, the weakest level of the trading band.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the HKMA has confidence to maintain a stable Hong Kong dollar to face the massive fund flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since April 12, the authority has bought HK$51 billion, which is a normal action under the linked exchange rate system, said Chan, adding that the HKMA will continue to buy the local currency due to the weak Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.8 to the US dollar but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85. The authority is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The money market rates should mirror those of its US counterpart, but the gap has now widened to around one percent since the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> started raising interest rates from ultra-low levels adopted during the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is expected to launch its first public annuity scheme in July, and the total amount will be HK$10 billion. Chan said it will consider increasing the amount if the annuity is oversubscribed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks tumbled 3.82 percent to end at their lowest level in 3 years yesterday, tracking the continuing slide in the Hong Kong dollar, which hit an eight-year low versus the US dollar, amid fears of capital flight and bets that the currency peg will go.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index ended at 18,886.30, with all major sectors down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of property developers led the plunge as investors expect banks to raise interest rates soon. Cheung Kong Property Holdings (1113) fell 7.05 percent to HK$41.50.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``After breaking below 19,200 points, investors realized they can't bet on a temporary bounce and there's a lack of confidence in the market now, '' said Conita Hung Lai-ping of Amicus Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Participants unloaded their shares as the HK dollar weakened further toward the 7.85 level and also on concern over the continuous capital outflows,'' said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local currency slid 0.09 percent to 7.8259 last night, the lowest since 2007, while one-year contracts for the HK dollar slumped to 7.8904, the lowest since 1999 and breaking the 7.75-7.85 range that the US dollar-pegged currency can trade within.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate inched up to 0.55 percent, the highest since July 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Standard Chartered Bank senior economist Kelvin Lau Kin-hang expects the HK dollar to fall below 7.85 in two weeks, a level which would compel the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to start buying it and selling the greenback to maintain the peg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An authority employee said it will be a ``normal phenomenon'' even if the HK dollar hits 7.85 and there is a large capital outflow from the SAR, given that the higher interest rate in the United States attracts capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority will do its best to maintain a stable exchange rate, but has no plan to change the peg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citibank said in a report that Hong Kong has more than US$300 billion (HK$2.34 trillion) of foreign currency reserves " which is enough for authorities to uphold the peg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the local bond market benefited from concerns over the HK dollar. The coupon rate on 10-year government bonds rose 24 percentage points to 1.792 percent yesterday, the highest since June 2013.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun- wah has warned that emerging countries might face a bursting of stock and property market bubbles after the normalization of the US interest rate, but he is confident Hong Kong can endure the possible turbulence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A strong blow to these economies might affect the financial stability of regional markets, including Hong Kong, Tsang wrote in a blog post yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Noting the surge in asset prices in many Asian countries and emerging markets amid the loosening monetary policy adopted by several countries such as the US, Tsang wrote: ``Whether these asset markets would suffer in capital outflow once the interest rate starts to rise, has become the biggest concern in the global financial market.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mid-2013, the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> mentioned the downscaling of quantitative easing policy for the first time, which immediately saw the asset sell-off and depreciation of currencies in emerging markets.This happened again in the second half of 2014 when easing came to an end, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said he is concerned the same trend may reoccur soon if the US announces the interest rate hike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``There will be greater risk if some countries do not have adequate foreign exchange reserves and the local financial markets are not matured,'' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang's comments come after several currencies " the Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah, Brazilian real and Russian ruble _ have fallen to lows against the US dollar recently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Tsang stressed that Hong Kong has the ability to cope with large-scale capital inflows or outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Measures have been taken by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> to strengthen banks' risk management ability, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local home market turned sluggish over the weekend after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said the US central bank could wind down its stimulus program later this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bernanke's comments also prompted the government to warn of further downside risk to the property sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah blogged yesterday that the SAR is likely to see large-scale capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``By then, interest rates in Hong Kong may be raised even before the US,'' Tsang stressed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He urged the public to pay attention to the downside risk in the local home market and consider one's affordability when interest rates rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 16 homes changed hands at 10 major housing estates over the weekend, down from 22 a week back, said Centaline Property Agency. Home viewings also dropped.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the major estates, four _ Taikoo Shing, Kornhill, Whampoa Gardens and Caribbean Coast _ saw no deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the apartments that were sold carried relatively cheaper prices, including those at Kingswood Villas in Tin Shui Wai.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An outflow of cash weakened the Hong Kong dollar to its lowest level in more than three decades yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange rate dropped to HK$7.8316 per US dollar, while the Hang Seng Index plunged through the 30,000 mark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar dropped to its lowest in more than 33 years amid a persistent gap between US and Hong Kong interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong currency, which is pegged in a range of HK$7.75-7.85 to the US dollar, fell as low as HK$7.8316.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The falling SAR stock market may be a reason for the weak Hong Kong dollar. The Hang Seng Index fell 2.28 percent, or 697 points, to 29,886 yesterday, while the China Enterprises Index lost 1.7 percent to 11,991 points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors worry that a US-led trade war could derail economic momentum around the world, while China kicked off its annual meeting of parliament, where few surprises are expected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said capital will leave Hong Kong due to US interest rate increases and tax reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he added the capital outflow was a good thing for Hong Kong as it could speed up normalizing interest rates in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there was a capital flow into Hong Kong of between US$130 billion and US$140 billion after the 2008 financial tsunami.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will ensure the financial markets operate in an orderly fashion, said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the authority said the market predicted the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> would speed up interest rate increases, making a wider interest rate spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which would lead to a weaker Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spokesman said market liquidity is good enough at present, and and there is no mass exodus of capital from the territory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, political factors as well as the fear of a trade war, may also have caused the decline in Hong Kong stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks were little changed yesterday, the first day of the meeting of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Beijing tends to maintain stability in the markets during such key meetings, and the government forbids a net outflow of capital in the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the close, the Shanghai Composite Index was up three points or 0.1 percent at 3,254 points, while the blue-chip CSI300 Index was up 0.05 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outflow will repatriate capital to the mainland from the Hong Kong market. But BOCHK Asset Management says it is a correction for the stock market as Hong Kong stocks went up too much at the beginning of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And it believes that mainland capital will continue to flow into Hong Kong as China still needs overseas investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Castor Pang Wai-sun, Core Pacific-Yamaichi head of research, said market sentiment has been poor, which makes investors tend to avoid risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said most institutional investors have been selling stocks in hand. Pang advised investors to do the same.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong neither intends nor plans to change its linked currency exchange rate to the US dollar, with Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah saying in his blog yesterday that it is the best arrangement for the SAR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will buy Hong Kong dollars and sell the greenback once the local currency weakens to 7.85, the weak side of the HKMA's convertibility undertaking, Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local currency hit 7.8259 last week from 7.7503 at the start of the year, sparking fears of an end to a link that puts the local dollar in a 7.75-7.85 range. The currency stood at 7.7967 on Friday after a one-day rebound of 0.27 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Both the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and the net capital outflow are within our expectations after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> started interest rate hikes last year,'' Tsang said. ``The two are inevitable during the process of normalization of local interest rates.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The correction of local stocks, the volatility of the yuan and some international investors' use of currency hedges against their Hong Kong stocks portfolio also added pressure to the Hong Kong dollar's depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``But there is no need to overreact and worry,'' Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A continuing capital inflow since 2008 has helped the authority to accumulate foreign reserves of more than US$130 billion (HK$1.01 trillion), with an increase in the local monetary base to HK$1 trillion. The capital is sufficient for maintaining Hong Kong dollar stability when outflow occurs, as well as for mild interest rate rises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stable exchange rate helps risk control and promotes trading and financial activities. Hong Kong has no intention to change the peg system, Tsang said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the underground currency war, the Asia-Pacific front is seeing the most intense action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Bank of Korea</span><span class="s1"> unexpectedly announced on Thursday that it is cutting interest rates to a record low of 1.75 percent. Central bank governor Lee Ju Yeol denied a currency war is being waged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A day before the Seoul action, the </span><span class="s3">Bank of Thailand</span><span class="s1"> also cut interest rates. The moves mean their currencies face downward pressure against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But since the euro and the yen are continuing to fall, the won has actually appreciated by 10 percent against both currencies, impacting on exports and forcing their central banks into the rates moves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In fact, the abnormal monetary easing by Europe and Japan are stimulating global liquidity, offsetting the negative impact from expectations of a move by the United States to raise rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the moves could also change the attitude of investors, affecting exports of countries whose currencies are on the high side, thus hitting their economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So as central banks deny the existence of a currency war, their actions give the lie to their words.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Because economies and exports still need to recover, it is believed that in the short term, countries in the region will continue to cut interest rates. Beijing, New Delhi and Singapore surprisingly loosened monetary policies this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, the currency war will bring potential risks to the Asian-Pacific region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One is that the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> could raise rates this year and easing monetary policy may cause outflows of capital from the Asia Pacific to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, part of the capital outflow is flowing from the euro region and Japan to Asia, alleviating some of the pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another concern is the Asia-Pacific property market. Besides China, mortgage delinquencies in Singapore and other countries continue to rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The quality of capital in banks is deteriorating at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the accelerated outflows put more pressure on the property market, it will lead to another financial crisis like 1997 in the Asia Pacific. Andrew Wong Wai-hong is an independent market commentator.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US stocks are to see the biggest correction since February and share prices of companies which piled up the most gains this year could fall significantly, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts reportedly said amid a slump in the technology sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1">'s strong quarter out of the way, and a very strong second quarter GDP number on the tape, investors were finally faced with the proverbial question of 'what do I have to look forward to now,'" a Morgan Stanley analyst wrote in a report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, portfolios concentrated on technology, consumption and small-caps could be shocked heavily, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such sectors could see a capital outflow in favor of S&amp;P index stocks, making it unlikely for the index to fall, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, other analysts don't agree with this view. John Hussman, chairman of Hussman Investment Trust who successfully forecast equity market crises in 2000 and 2008, said he expects to see a 64 percent fall in the S&amp;P 500 Index, a 57 percent decline in the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> Index and a steep 69 percent plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Index. While the percentage falls seem too extreme, they are supported by valuation, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citing his calculations, the price to sale ratio of the S&amp;P 500 currently stands at a record high 2.4 times compared to below 0.7 times in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun and vice president Joseph Tsai Chung Hsin have been reducing their stakes in the conglomerate in the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Alibaba filing to the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> last Friday showed that Ma trimmed his stake in Alibaba to 6.4 percent from 7 percent in 2017, while Tsai cut his holding by 0.2 percent to 2.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last September, the technology giant said Ma and Tsai would offload some holdings for the purpose of charity commitment and general wealth management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Suning.com, the mainland's largest online electronic products retailer, also sold some of its holdings in Alibaba in the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, stocks remained weak yesterday, with the Hang Seng Index dropping 150.12 points or 0.52 percent to 28,583.01. </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700) was the most traded stock, though it closed 2.72 percent lower at HK$357.20, the lowest in nine months. The company was reportedly under investigation by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology due to user reports on information abuses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other technology companies closed lower, with Xiaomi (1810), the first dual class listed firm, tumbling 6.1 percent to HK$17.54, below its IPO price. </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology</span><span class="s1"> (2382) fell 3.82 percent to HK$130.80, the worst-performing blue chip in the morning session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Country Garden Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (2007) rebounded on news that construction in 98 percent of its projects has resumed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The redevelopment site occupies an area of about 238,600 square feet, and the plan approved in 2011 will see </span><span class="s3">Swire Properties</span><span class="s1"> building two commercial buildings that offer a total gross floor area of about two million sq ft of office space.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Swire Properties</span><span class="s1"> this year applied for a relaxation on the height limitation for one of the buildings from 195 meters to 212 meters. The developer was also looking to double the floor area for retail and service purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The department believes that </span><span class="s3">Swire Properties</span><span class="s1"> does not have sufficient support for its request to relax height limitations. It is worried the move may set an inappropriate precedent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Swire Properties</span><span class="s1"> said it is disappointed with some of the comments from the department and hopes that the board would take a balanced view before making any final decision.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds flowing out of Hong Kong and interest rates going up are just a matter of time, a Hong Kong Monetary Authority spokesman said yesterday, after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> kept its rates unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hongkongers have become accustomed to an environment of a strong Hong Kong dollar, capital inflows and low interest rates over the past few years, the spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this was due to the Fed's ultra- loose monetary policies needed to support the US economy after the 2008 financial crisis, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spokesman urged banks, enterprises and individuals to manage their liquidity and avoid excessive borrowing, as the increases in interest rates and capital outflow from the SAR are inevitable under the normalization of local monetary conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Fed said it is ``closely monitoring'' global economic and financial developments, signaling it had accounted for a stock market selloff but is not ready to abandon a plan to tighten monetary policy this year. The decision by the central bank's rate- setting committee to keep rates unchanged was widely expected after a month-long plunge in US and world equities raised concerns an abrupt global slowdown could drag on US growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fed policymakers, led by Janet Yellen, said the US economy is still on track for moderate growth and a stronger labor market even with ``gradual'' rate increases, suggesting its concern about global events had diminished but not squashed chances of a rate hike in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation,'' the Fed said yesterday. STAFF REPORTER and REUTERS</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar weakened 0.04 percent to 7.7677 per US dollar as at 8:41 pm yesterday, the lowest level since June following a US rate hike last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local currency has softened 0.12 percent against the US dollar since the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised interest rates on last Wednesday by 0.25 percent.Ample Finance Group's director Alex Wong Kwok-ying expected the gradual drop in the local currency against the US dollar will be sustained, as capital is flowing to the United States from the SAR amid a strong US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar in a band of 7.75 to 7.85 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"One thing for sure is that the Hong Kong dollar will not gain strength against the US dollar in the short term as no capital will not flow into the local market with a strong US dollar,'' said Wong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Across the border, the mainland has suffered much stronger from capital outflows amid a strong US dollar. Ministry of Commerce researcher Jin Bosong said yesterday at a press briefing that the yuan will depreciate against the dollar by another 3 percent to 5 percent in 2017. The yuan has already depreciated about 7 percent this year against the US dollar. Another reason for a weaker yuan could be gold transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Haywood Cheung Tak-hay, president of the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society a 20-30 percent jump in the transaction for physical gold and gold accessories in the latest two to three years in Hong Kong has weakened the yuan..</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, local banks continue to increase deposit rates to attract capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, </span><span class="s3">Wing Lung Bank</span><span class="s1"> is now offering 4.3 percent interest rate, the highest in the city, for yuan deposits with a tenor of six, nine and twelve months with a minimum input of about 100,000 yuan. One to three month yuan deposits can earn an interest rate of 4.5 percent at the bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, the Hang Seng Index fell 0.85 percent yesterday to 21,832.68, its lowest level since August 4. The local benchmark gauge fell for three days in a row since the US rate hike, as property developers tumbled on rising borrowing costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, inflows from mainland investors have dried up and a slumping yuan has undermined investor confidence in Chinese assets, dragging local equities lower.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves posted their sharpest quarterly decline on record during the July- September period, as the central bank stepped up intervention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It aimed to stabilize the yuan and calm sentiment after an unexpected devaluation of its currency jolted global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves, still the world's largest, dropped US$43.3 billion (HK$337.74 billion) to US$3.51 trillion last month, central bank data showed yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They were down by about US$180 billion in the third quarter, the largest quarterly fall since 1980.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the pace of decline in its reserves slowed in September, compared to a record US$93.9 billion drop in August after a shock yuan devaluation spurred unprecedented outflows and prompted the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to sell US dollars to prop up its exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan climbed to an almost two-month high yesterday, thanks to the smaller-than-expected decline in reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, it surged 0.2 percent to 6.3395 per US dollar as at 8.52pm yesterday, near a September 30 level of 6.3332 that was the strongest since the August 11 devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan last week erased its discount to the Shanghai rate, amid speculation the central bank was selling US dollars in an effort to add the yuan to the special drawing rights basket of the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The worst time [relating to capital outflow] has passed,'' Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liao said the PBoC still needs to sell greenback and buy yuan to ease downside pressures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign reserves are estimated to ease by US$10 billion to US$20 billion a month in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas lending by Hong Kong banks, mostly to mainland firms, slipped by 2.2 percent to HK$2.32 trillion in August, according to </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> data. The fall was the first in more than four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> said lending was likely adversely affected by devaluation of the yuan, which made domestic loans cheaper.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Home affordability has continued to worsen as local buyers need an average of 14.7 years to repay mortgages _ just above the highs of 1997.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is according to the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">'s half-yearly report, which shows household income failed to catch up with home price growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The income-gearing ratio of mortgages also rose to 65 percent, well above the long- term average of 50 percent. If the mortgage interest rate had risen by 3 percentage points, the ratio would hit 84 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``It is critically important that banks should restrain their exposure to property-related lending and maintain a prudent stance when granting new mortgages and asset-backed loans,'' the de facto central bank said in the report, which warned of a possible rate hike on future stimulus tapering by the US Federal Reserve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But home prices rose at a slower pace in the first half, by only 6.8 percent compared with 25.7 percent for the whole of 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pre-tax profit of local retail banks rose 30.9 percent in the first half, but interest-rate volatility and mainland exposure will cast a shadow, the HKMA said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interest income and non- interest income of banks rose 7.8 percent and 19.6 percent, respectively, while net interest margin improved to 1.41 percent from 1.37 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKMA warned of likely increased interest-rate volatility and capital outflow from Asia on any Fed tapering.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The specter of higher interest rates is looming - which signals more trouble for the sluggish property market, analysts warned yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More potential buyers are likely to put off purchasing flats, they said, after the US Federal Reserve stated it could start scaling down its stimulus package later this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate would rise in the coming months if the Fed lowered the scale of bond purchase later this year, which would also shrink market liquidity," said Paul Tang Sai-on, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> (0023). Long-term interest rates would rise next year, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sharmaine Lau Yuen-yuen, chief economic analyst at mReferral, said banks would raise their mortgage rates slightly starting from the end of this year mainly due to low profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The loan rate would then increase back to a reasonable level of 3-4 percent when the economy gets better," Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Centaline Mortgage managing director Ivy Wong Mei-fung also expects banks to hike mortgage rates by 2015 when interest rates start to rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow may also take place as money may be repatriated to the United States as interest rates there are expected to rise from 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A homebuyer who borrowed HK$1 million for 20 years would have to pay around HK$500 more for HK$5,621 per month if the mortgage rate is raised by one percentage point from the current low rate of 2.15 percent. He would have to pay as much as HK$1,550 more if mortgage rates went up by 3 percentage points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 1994, local home prices fell by 28 percent in 13 months when the Fed gradually hiked interest rates by 3 percentage points. But in 2004 home prices were stable when the Fed raised the rate by 4.25 percentage points over a 25-month period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Jones Lang LaSalle</span><span class="s1"> managing director Joseph Tsang Hon-ping said home prices may drop by 20-30 percent if the interest rates on savings increase by 3 percentage points. It is almost at zero percent now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said local homes prices have fallen by 10-15 percent after the series of curbs imposed by the government last October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Property transactions plunged to 4,276 deals in May from 8,714 last October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> head of property loans Kenneth Tsin Wai-lun said local purchasing demand would still support the home market despite possible capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expects home transactions to stand around 5,000 deals a month during the second half - similar to the first six months of the year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong shares hit a year low yesterday despite a ``V'' shape rebound in mainland equities amid concerns over an expected rate hike in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index slumped 307 points, or 1.31 percent to end at 23,167.85, on turnover of HK$91.77 billion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's night futures continued to slide following the fall in US stocks by 10pm yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Expectations of a US interest rate hike will inevitably lead to a capital outflow from emerging markets, although the hike may come in a very gentle way,'' analyst Ricky Huang Wei, of Lukfook Financial, said. ``Foreign institutions are quite negative to China's economy, and Hong Kong became a place to sell off,'' Huang added. Local stocks may slide more but will find support at 22,830.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The market is dominated by sellers now, but the trading volume is picking up and we may see more bullish investors join in.''</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Upbeat employment figures and reports of higher wages coming out of the United States have given the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> a green light to raise interest rates this week despite slowing economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But DBS Hong Kong economist Nathan Chow Hung-lai believes local rates will be unchanged until the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He predicts the local banking system will be immune from moves in the United States until "after the Fed raises rate twice." Then Hong Kong will feel the pressure to act.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said arbitrage opportunities will emerge after the rate hike as the local currency has weakened and Hong Kong saw a slight capital outflow last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also warned that the HIBOR will rise if the Fed decides to raise rates - likely on Wednesday - as that has not been priced in the interbank lending market. It will not fall back in the short term, Chow added, as market expectations are for another US rate hike in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Central bankers had on Friday got the final push they needed - that is if they were in any doubt - with US employment data showing 235,000 new jobs created in February and the unemployment rate moving down a 10th of a point to 4.7 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month's brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by steady wage growth, with average hourly earnings rising 6 US cents, or 0.2 percent. January's wage growth was revised up to 0.2 percent from a 0.1 percent gain, lifting the year-on-year increase in wages to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even before the jobs report - and despite questions about the Trump administration's economic agenda - key figures on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the federal funds rate, sent clear signals a rate hike was likely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer said recently that if there had been a "conscious effort" among Fed members to raise the public's expectations "I'm about to join it."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expecting a move noted that the central bank has largely met its targets for unemployment and inflation, despite some sour notes in other data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They've virtually achieved their dual mandate," said Mickey Levy, chief Americas economist at Berenberg Capital Markets. "This is really a simple decision." On Friday afternoon, the Fed fund futures market put the probability of a 25-basis-point increase at 93 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's largest economy has steadily pumped out new jobs since mid- 2016, with the three-month average for job creation at 209,000 for December through February. And the unemployment rate has remained below 5 percent since May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The price index in January for personal consumption expenditures - the Fed's preferred inflation measure - hit its fastest annual pace in more than four years, reaching 1.9 percent. And consumer confidence in February was at a 15-year high.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese regulators are imposing limits on cross-border flows from yuan- denominated capital pools and conducting more stringent checks on transactions, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This comes as Beijing moves to restrict a capital outflow sparked by flight from a falling yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts believe the yuan will not be allowed to weaken sharply. Financial regulators have asked banks in coastal cities to strictly abide by regulations on cross-border outflows from their yuan-denominated capital pools.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At no time can outflows exceed the size of those pools.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Officials have also ordered banks to conduct strict checks on corporate business and transactions that affect those yuan capital pools, the people said. It is unclear whether the policy will be imposed or remain selective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is also planning to look into entrepot trade in the country's ports, and is possibly conducting major investigations into illegal cross-border capital flows masked as trade deals. Some economists suspect China's surprisingly positive December trade figures were artificially inflated by such activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators are also considering allowing direct cross-border yuan loans as well as foreign-currency loans that could help narrow any gap between the offshore and onshore exchange rates, making arbitrage less profitable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> (2888), DBS Group and </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> were suspended this month by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> from conducting some foreign exchange business, apparently due to the large scale of their cross-border forex businesses, according to Reuters. StanChart chief executive for Greater China Benjamin Hung Pi- cheng declined to comment yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> (0005) Greater China chief executive Helen Wong said the market volatility does not lower expectations for the eventual internationalization of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore, the yuan slightly weakened to above 6.59 yesterday, while the onshore yuan remained steady around 6.58.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 9,500 applications were made for De Novo flats, representing an oversubscription of 27 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The project provides 338 flats priced between HK$3.41 million and HK$6.62 million, levels that are 20 percent lower than prevailing prices last month.</span></p>

It believes a potential capital outflow might result in the the Hong Kong dollar's further weakening to between 7.75 to 7.85 against the greenback. To maintain the peg, the HKMA might induce a fall of property prices by as much as 30 percent from its peak last year, it said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan in Hong Kong climbed 0.09 percent to 6.4413 per dollar as of 9:15 p.m. The onshore yuan in Shanghai was little changed and closed at 6.3987.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``A slower pace of raising interest rates in the US means smaller capital outflow pressure for emerging markets, including China.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's regulators are further tightening the government's capital controls, requiring banks in Shanghai to "import" 100 yuan (HK$113.19) for every 100 yuan that they allow a client to remit overseas, ensuring no net outflows of the yuan, according to a </span><span class="s3">Financial Times</span><span class="s1"> report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before the new regulation, Shanghai- based banks were allowed to remit 160 yuan overseas for every 100 yuan that they brought back into China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The clampdown goes even further in Beijing where banks must import 100 yuan for every 80 yuan they remit overseas on behalf of clients, ensuring a net inflow into the capital," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rules came amid Chinese regulators' bid to further stem capital outflow and to stabilize the yuan from depreciating further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Remitting renminbi offshore, where it can be converted into foreign exchange, was one way to avoid new capital controls," the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Such transfers were also consistent with Beijing's desire to promote the renminbi as an international currency, by encouraging companies to use it for trade transactions, shareholder loan repayments and dividend remittances," the report added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1"> (3968) now requires customers to deposit at least 50,000 yuan for three consecutive months when they open new accounts under the Hong Kong "all-in- one" card, according to local media reports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The bank used to require customers to be a gold card holder, but it now has more requirements," said a CMB staff member.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new requirement though has not deterred mainlanders from opening a new account for CMB's "all-in-one" card. At one CMB branch in Shanghai, reservations for opening an "all-in-one" card account has already been arranged up to August 14. It takes another four to six weeks for applications to be approved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With mainlanders' purchases of insurance products in Hong Kong capped at US$5,000 (HK$39,000) if using UnionPay, </span><span class="s3">MasterCard</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Visa</span><span class="s1">, having their own Hong Kong bank account has become their first choice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The popularity of China Merchant Bank's "all-in-one" card has surged as it provides mainlanders a mainland and a Hong Kong bank account at the same time. Customers are not required to be in Hong Kong to set up a new account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local media have also reported that certain China-funded banks have been found to be checking how their mainland customers were using their money when making fund transfers using their local bank accounts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consumer price index for June in China rose 1.9 percent in annual terms while the producer price index fell 2.6 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The CPI eased 0.1 percentage point from May reflecting a persistently sluggish domestic demand. </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> said yesterday the state's projected gross domestic product growth was 6.6 percent for this year and 6.0-6.2 percent for 2017.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UBS China economist Hu Yifan expects the fiscal policy to play a more critical role seeing the monetary policy could not control the direction of capital flow, which mostly went to investment instead of the real economy in the past years. Citi said the capital outflow for the second quarter was US$110- US$120 billion (HK$858-HK$936 billion) and the estimated total net outflow was seen reaching US$580 billion this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">World share markets regained ground as news that the United States and North Korea will meet for talks next month came on top of hopes that President Donald Trump's political allies would convince him to avoid a global trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong shares rallied, with the Hang Seng Index rebounding beyond 30,000 points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But analysts said markets will continue seesawing in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HSI opened 494 points or 1.7 percent higher and closed at 30,511, up 624 points or 2.1 percent from Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Blue-chips led the uptrend. </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> was up 3.20 percent to HK$438.60 while </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced 3.60 percent to HK$83.50. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> advanced 2.09 to HK$283.00 and </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1"> jumped 3.20 percent to HK$64.55.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from eased worries over a trade war, Stanley Chik, head of research from Bright Smart Securities, believed the rise came from the well-performing A-share market, as well as the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">'s plan to relax bad-loan provisioning requirements for banks which pushed up share prices of mainland lenders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bank of China climbed 2.66 percent to HK$4.25 while </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> rose 3.08 percent to HK$8.02.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Chik forecast that market corrections will persist in the coming months and the market will remain vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"From my perspective, the trade war is still a worry," he said, adding that the February US unemployment data - to be made public on Friday - could accelerate another rate increase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US President Donald Trump declared that he will not retreat from his plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after House Speaker Paul Ryan rejected the plan, saying the US economy could suffer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Howard Lee Tat-chi, deputy chief executive of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, said the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar is just part of interest rate normalization.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He emphasized that the authority can stabilize the local currency, but it chooses to remain neutral at this point because banks in the city seem able to deal with the situation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong said as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will soon begin to reduce its portfolio holdings and hike interest rate, there seems to be a lag in response from the SAR currency market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested yesterday in his blog there might be a need to manage the response. A widening interest rate gap between the SAR and United States will lead to capital outflow, Yam wrote, and it will weaken the Hong Kong dollar towards weak-side convertibility undertaking at HK$7.85 per greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under this scenario, the HKMA will undertake to sell US dollars, leading to a drop in the aggregate balance of Hong Kong's interbank liquidity and a rise in interest rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yam said there might be chances of a market shock if the process occurred suddenly.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rate rise for overnight loans and that of seven-day loans does not signal an increase in the benchmark interest rate, state-backed media stress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A media outlet under </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> said yesterday that the move to widen the interest rate spread between China and the United States is to increase the attractiveness of yuan assets after the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CCTV also pointed out that the credit tightening targets financial institutions but not deposits by corporates and the masses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This comes after market speculation that China is set to increase its benchmark interest rate after implementing measures to tighten credit since the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> injected 638.68 billion yuan (HK$721.09 billion) via short and medium-term liquidity tools in January, down 26 percent from the previous month, data showed on Friday, signalling an effort to cool down rapid credit growth. The reduced injections coincided with the central bank's move to push up some lending rates, in a further sign that it is moving to monetary policy tightening as the economy stabilizes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said on its website that it loaned 551 billion yuan to financial institutions via its medium-term lending facility in January.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outstanding MLF loans totalled 3.57 trillion yuan at the end of January, compared with 3.45 trillion yuan at the end of December, implying a net injection of 115.5 billion yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of ETFs in Europe tracking Chinese shares is still very limited, accounting for 1.9 percent, or US$5 billion, of assets under management of all listed ETFs in Europe.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent crackdown on margin trading and new IPOs limited the upside in A shares but the trend of lowering interest rates and RRR should bring support to the stock market whenever there is weakness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So, let's keep bullish on Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks this year though there is no rush to buy into rallies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, we can expect more yuan borrowings or dim sum bond issuance in Hong Kong as the US dollar appreciates. In the past, mainland property companies liked to borrow US dollars in Hong Kong either from the banks or by issuing bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The interest was normally 3-4 percent for a three- to five-year loan, lower than borrowing in yuan in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan depreciated 2.4 percent to the US dollar last year. If this trend continues, all the interest savings will be eaten up by the exchange losses when these mainland companies repay the US dollar loan on maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, whether or not China will let the yuan depreciate more than 2 percent per year is questionable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If it wants to avoid too much capital outflow, the yuan cannot be too weak. Dr Check and/or The Standard bear no responsibility for any investment decision made based on the views expressed in this column.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan declined yesterday, snuffing out earlier gains as concern over trade friction with the United States overshadowed a move by China late Friday to support its currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan slipped 0.17 percent to 6.8402 per dollar as of 4.02 p.m.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Friday evening said it was imposing a reserve requirement of 20 percent on trading of some foreign-exchange forward contracts, effectively making it more expensive to short the yuan. The central bank used the same approach after its 2015 devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The return of the 20 percent reserve requirement rule is a clear indication from Chinese authorities that recent pace of weakening in the yuan has been excessive," </span><span class="s3">United Overseas Bank</span><span class="s1"> strategists including Heng Koon How wrote in a note yesterday. They said further yuan weakness is likely after temporary near-term stability passes, and maintained their 6.95 per dollar year-end forecast and 7.1 for mid-2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Various existing negative drivers against the yuan remain in place and have mostly intensified," the note said. "These range from further anticipated US Fed rate hikes, deteriorating U.S.-China trade relations, lower China yield curve and weakness in the yuan's trade-weighted basket."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Economic Observer cited PBOC adviser Sheng Songcheng as saying the yuan won't fall to 7 per dollar. It also said the yuan's depreciation would lead to capital outflow pressure. The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan's daily reference rate at 6.8513, the weakest since May last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's government has made preparations to support the Hong Kong stock market if needed to create a positive atmosphere before July 1, when Xi Jinping is expected to visit the city for the first time as President to mark 20 years of Chinese rule, Bloomberg reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-backed institutions have set aside funds to ensure stable trading before the anniversary of Hong Kong's 1997 handover, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is unclear how much money has been earmarked or what market conditions would trigger government action.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose 0.4 percent yesterday to 25,125.55 points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lines between the markets have blurred in recent years with the introduction of cross-border exchange links and cooperation agreements between the Chinese and Hong Kong securities regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock connect has already brought mainland markets closer to Hong Kong, but there will be a lot of people who will be dissatisfied with this, at least in principle," said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at </span><span class="s3">Saxo Bank A/S</span><span class="s1"> in Copenhagen. "Expect some political noise."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government's intervention is unwelcome in Hong Kong as it could boost risk premiums and pressure the valuation of stocks in the long term," said Daniel So, a Hong Kong-based strategist at CMB International Securities. "Though it could boost stock prices in the near term."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Bank of England</span><span class="s1"> said yesterday it may need to raise interest rates faster than the market suggests, assuming Brexit goes well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said its latest forecasts are based on the assumption that new relations with the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> are "smooth."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Toby Gibb, investment director at Fidelity International, said the election of Emmanuel Macron as French President helps dismiss concerns over eurozone and it might attract about US$100 billion (HK$780 billion) of capital outflow from Europe last year to move back to Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He believes now is a good time to make long-term investment in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, digital currency bitcoin surged pass US$1,800 for the first time and closed at about HK$1,827 in the evening yesterday, as shown in the Coindesk's bitcoin price index. With Japan recognizing bitcoin as currency recently, more bitcoins are being bought with Japanese yen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, Qingdao Port (6198) said it would place 243 million new H shares at HK$4.32 per share. Those ordinary shares account for 22.11 percent and 4.84 percent of total issued H shares and issued shares of the company, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Huaneng Renewables</span><span class="s1"> (0958) said it placed 840 million new H shares at HK$2.61 per share to six to 10 parties.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan rose yesterday to a 10-month high against the US dollar as the greenback weakened and as the redback received a boost from a report about China's strong foreign exchange reserves even if the country's exports and imports grew much less than expected in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan climbed as much as 0.36 percent to 6.6974 against US dollar at one point yesterday, the most since October 10 last year. The spot rate has risen nearly 4 percent year-to-date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan also rose by up to 0.44 percent to 6.7019, the strongest level since late June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before the market opened, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the midpoint rate at 6.7184 per US dollar, 0.07 percent firmer than the previous fix of 6.7228.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The continuous rise of the yuan reflects the weakness of the US dollar ... Not only the yuan, but the euro is also rising," says Nathan Chow Hung-lai, an economist at DBS Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong foreign exchange reserves and stable exchange rate between the yuan and the dollar reflects decreasing expectation of a weak yuan amid an effective control of capital outflow, said Cheng Shi, managing director, chief economist and head of research at ICBC International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The sharp rise of the yuan was a result of corporate dollar selling," said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. Companies with long dollar positions were liquidating to reduce exchange losses, the trader added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The yuan won't fluctuate much before the upcoming </span><span class="s3">NPC</span><span class="s1"> [19th National Party Congress]," Chow forecast, "It will be maintained between 6.7 to 6.75 in 2-3 months."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's exports and imports grew much less than expected in July, raising concerns if global demand is starting to cool even as major Western central banks consider reducing years of massive stimulus support.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's export growth slowed to 7.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the weakest pace since February and cooling from an 11.3 percent rise in June, official data showed yesterday. Analysts had expected a 10.9 percent gain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's imports rose 11.0 percent, the slowest growth since December and down from a 17.2 percent rise in the previous month.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market focus has again been on the pound Sterling, even though Theresa May's Brexit speech did not disclose anything concrete.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There were two reasons for the volatility. First, investors had over-reacted to news that Britain would prefer a hard Brexit, before her speech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Second, US President-elect Donald Trump suddenly expressed concerns over a stronger dollar. This added fuel to the fire when short-Sterling positions were squeezed. After the markets calmed down in Asian time yesterday, the Cable resumed its downtrend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are still numerous hurdles and problems ahead. It is inevitable that more similar jerky trading will happen in the coming months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Trump's US dollar comments did help relieve downward pressure on the yuan.</span></p>

Share prices of local property developers rallied.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rumors spread that COSCO may bid for OOCL. The share price of OOCL (316) rose 7 percent while COSCO Group (1919) gained 6 percent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve meeting, the Hang Seng Index rebounded 180 points yesterday to close at 22,141. The Fed was expected to announce a further US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) in tapering, reducing its bond buying to US$65 billion per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the US economy is recovering, it is reasonable for the United States to start raising interest rates. Tightening is under way there and in China, and has spread to Turkey and India, which have raised interest rates to defend their weakening currencies and capital outflow. It is inevitable that global stock and foreign-exchange markets will remain volatile throughout 2014, so prepare to face some headwinds after the Lunar New Year break.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the Hong Kong stock market is very sensitive, any turmoil in emerging markets will be likely to have an impact here. I expect the Hang Seng Index to hit a year low somewhere near 20,500 to 21,000. The way the mainland government handles the shadow banking problem will be the key.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Positions for foreign-exchange purchases on the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">'s balance sheet last month fell the most since January 2017, reflecting faster capital outflows and more intense official intervention as the yuan weakened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stockpile shrank 119.4 billion yuan ($17.2 billion) to 21.4 trillion yuan, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> yesterday. The yuan depreciated more than 8 percent in the six months through September, and hit its lowest since January 2017 yesterday after the </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> stopped short of naming China a currency manipulator in a report overnight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan's decline has reignited the debate over whether or when it will break the key psychological milestone of 7 against the dollar, a level not reached since the global financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The data is a strong signal that China did use some bullets to defend the exchange rate," and that it will attempt to stabilize the yuan before trade negotiations restart, said Ding Shuang, Greater China and North Asia chief economist at Standard Chartered Plc. "Capital outflow pressures will jump if the currency weakens significantly before the end of the year. The yuan will likely break 7 in early 2019."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, strong dollar bond issuance by China's town builders remains unabated, as the deeply-rooted perception of state support for the debt-laden sector continues to draw investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for the US dollar, the 3-month LIBOR increased to 2.4496, the highest since November 2008, representing the creditors' concerns on debtors following the potential US interest rate hike.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of China's overseas property investments fell 13.6 percent year-on- year to US$10.7 billion (HK$83.46 billion) in the first half, says consultancy Knight Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's capital outflow controls have made it difficult for some investors, mainly smaller ones, to obtain foreign exchange clearance, it said. The United States was the most popular destination for Chinese capital, attracting US$5.1 billion in the first half, up 21 percent from a year back, said Paul Hart, executive director of Greater China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York attracted 80 percent of the US investment, of which 62 percent was in office deals. Investment in Britain jumped 75 percent in the first six months and Brexit has not cooled demand with a number of major office transactions completing since July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong saw US$1.68 billion worth of Chinese investment, slightly lower than the first half last year. But the consultancy has seen a number of large deals since July "which will enhance the whole year result."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Owning office space is an attractive option due to Hong Kong having the world's highest office rents," Knight Frank said. "Meanwhile, the city's residential land market also offers better value than some hotly contested Chinese markets."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange has been witnessing a strange phenomenon of late. Despite market conditions being weak with shrinking turnovers, the IPO market has been buzzing with activity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gongs at the bourse - which are used at listing ceremonies to mark the beginning of a company's trading - have not stopped ringing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, Hong Kong's stock market is more mature than its counterparts on the mainland. If this had to happen in the A-shares market, investors would definitely cry foul and ask regulators to put a halt to new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My question this time is: Where is the bottom?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As there is no crystal ball for the market, no one can tell when Hong Kong stocks will hit the bottom. However, there still are some key indicators we need to pay attention to.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The most important indicator, of course, should be the yuan's movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total turnover of Hong Kong stocks dropped to 70 billion in recent days, making local equities more prone to be affected by A-shares. However, A-shares almost track the yuan's exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, though the US dollar retreated last night after being boosted by the US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's speech, the yuan still dropped below 6.78, stopping the rising trend of stocks in Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The depreciation of the yuan raises many fears. If China's government is not involved in this - or if they did not take advantage of the currency to fight the trade war - then it becomes all the more worrying, as it would mean that the yuan's slump is tied to capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the slump deepens, there will be more capital outflow and it will be much more difficult to break this vicious circle in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, the global stock markets are still stable. The A-shares loss is the second worst after Turkish shares, and we have opportunity to find the short-term bottom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks valuation has become more attractive. With companies due to post their results shortly, the Hang Seng Index may find its real support level if the results indicate good performance in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though trading volumes have been low in recent days, there are still points worth looking at. Xiaomi (1810) was at first underestimated but then surprised us by setting new highs several times, until a sharp correction yesterday. It not only showed speculation but also unmatched transaction volumes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The World Cup has come to an end, but this has not helped the stock market either, and the situation might not improve until company results start to flow in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Therefore, I suggest that shareholders be patient instead of overly pessimistic.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau extended gaming revenue gains in November, posting the strongest growth in almost three years and advancing a recovery that's seen more visitors flock to the local resorts of </span><span class="s3">Las Vegas Sands Corp</span><span class="s1">. and </span><span class="s3">Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd</span><span class="s1">. in the world's largest gambling hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gross gaming revenue rose 14.4 percent to 18.8 billion patacas (HK$18.25 billion), according to Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That compares with the median estimate for an 11 percent advance in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts. It is the fourth straight month of gains and the strongest year-on-year growth since February 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Visitation is starting to grow again and more importantly, people are staying longer," said Marcus Liu, a gaming analyst at </span><span class="s3">CLSA Ltd</span><span class="s1">. The strong growth is also due to a low base, as November last year posted the worst performance in five years, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US$30 billion (HK$234 billion) gaming industry in Macau has rebounded from a two-year slump as operators including </span><span class="s3">Wynn Macau</span><span class="s1"> opened new, billion-dollar resorts. Casino operators in the Chinese special administrative region have turned to attracting more families and casual gamblers amid President Xi Jinping's efforts to curb official corruption and limit capital outflow that chased away high-stakes players who accounted for the bulk of bets.Macau casino shares gained on news of the November revenue gains, with </span><span class="s3">SJM Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0880) gaining 1 percent at HK$6.34 and the Bloomberg Intelligence Macau Gaming Index surging by as much as 2.5 percent. Macau's gaming industry got a significant boost as visitor arrivals reached 2.7 million in October, with overnight visitors up 12 percent year- on-year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Melco Crown chairman and chief executive officer Lawrence Ho said the industry is experiencing a healthy rebound. "We are in a recovery. That recovery won't be the same as the recovery during the global financial crisis," he said. "It's going to be more of a natural recovery."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index plunged 620 points or 2.58 percent to 23,368 yesterday " the sharpest single-day drop since February.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It came as a weak manufacturing survey added to worries about China's slowing economy while clashes between protesters and police at Admiralty battered sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index eased 0.1 percent to 2,680.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fulbright Securities research director Kingston Lin King-ham said the slump was partly due to the violence in Hong Kong as well as the latest factory data from China that stood at an eight-month low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin said the two-month long Occupy movement appeared to be getting out of control in recent days and it seemed Hong Kong shares were much more severely affected by the economic figures that their Shanghai counterpart.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``We did not expect to see such a sharp drop [in Hong Kong], although a round of adjustment has been forecast after the </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index tried several times but failed to firmly rise above 25,000,'' Lin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Selling pressure still exists amid political uncertainty and HSI is likely to slide to 23,000, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``To push the market up, we need positive economic data in the last month and a quick end to the Occupy activities, as [China has already lowered interest rates] '' Lin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Philip Securities asset management director Louis Wong Wai-kit, however, expects mainland authorities to launch more stimulus measures to boost the stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The impact of the interest rate cut has been digested and we are counting on Beijing to lower the banks' required reserve ratio this month,'' Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He believes heavy activity in the local initial public offering market has also tightened capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Energy and environment related companies collectively dropped yesterday, probably owing to capital outflow going to lock into shares of </span><span class="s3">CGN Power</span><span class="s1">,'' Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail book of China's largest nuclear power producer was oversubscribed at least 66 times and is expected to freeze up to HK$300 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong expects the HSI to continue to slide but find support at 23,200.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese conglomerates are still going on a global shopping spree despite the government discouraging overseas merger and acquisition activities - seen as a main channel of capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> (0656) chief executive Liang Xinjun said his company could benefit from more development opportunities with adequate overseas assets, while other mainland firms have difficulties carrying capital abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liang also aims to increase the liquidity of its assets via initial public offerings, as the group plans to spin off its health care and tourism units in two separate IPOs this year. Listing of its tourism unit, which includes the Atlantis Sanya Hotel and its China travel joint venture with Europe's second-largest tour operator, Thomas Cook, will be completed in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai-based conglomerate yesterday signed a cooperation agreement with China Financial Services (0605), in which Fosun holds a 4.9 percent stake, involving wealth management, potential acquisitions and small loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Financial aims to boost assets under management to hit HK$30 billion, with the number of clients reaching 300,000 within three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fosun shares fell 0.18 percent to HK$11.12 yesterday, while China Financial remained unchanged at 71 HK cents.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserve regulator is adopting various measures to curb capital outflow, including wanting banks to advise clients to buy yuan and sell US dollars and ensuring research analysts keep to themselves any negative views on the currency's prospects, several bankers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan lost more than 6 percent against the US dollar last year and is at eight-year lows, prompting a flurry of restrictive measures on capital outflows from the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These include setting limits on banks' currency volumes in some cities or provinces and requiring approval for even smaller transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan weakened one basis point yesterday to 6.9235 against the US dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SAFE's reticence began at least as far back as August, when its Shanghai branch called at least 20 of the major foreign and domestic banks operating in the city to a meeting with the regional heads of several SAFE departments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"You must control your forex deficit, but you can't say that SAFE is controlling capital outflows," the official told the bankers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One banker said: "They told us not to publish bad house views - analyst house views - on the yuan."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves fell to US$3.05 trillion (HK$23.79 trillion) in November from US$3.3 trillion in the first 11 months of 2016, and the market forecasts China's foreign reserves may fall to below US$3 trillion in January. But SAFE wants banks to advise clients to buy yuan and sell dollars, the international bank representative said, a play that is likely to lose clients money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was a rumor currently, but if it's true, the regulator may want the banks to encourage state-owned enterprises to sell their foreign currencies," sai Liao Qun, chief economist and head of research at CITIC Bank International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In my view, it's only an encouragement, not a command."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Peng Cheng, investment strategist for the Asia Pacific region at Citi Private Bank, said: "If [regulators] continued to restrict purchasing foreign currency, it may bring unexpected results. Thus, they may force enterprises to sell more foreign currencies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citi expects the yuan to fall to 7.05 against the US dollar by year-end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the price of the digital currency bitcoin fell by about US$50 yesterday after </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> announced the launch of spot investigations on bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai to fend off market risks and scrutinize various issues.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the transactions, 4,014 involved residential units - a drop of 31 percent from the previous year, but 14.2 percent increase over July.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Far East Consortium Development (0035) said mainland developers are currently facing capital outflow pressures from the Chinese government, and therefore they can hardly invest overseas, including bidding for building sites in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's progress toward full inclusion of its stocks in global benchmarks could be halted if the world's second-largest economy cracks down further on people moving money out of the country, index provider </span><span class="s3">MSCI Inc</span><span class="s1">'s top executive said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If they reverse course and they restrict the 'out' door, then how can we?" MSCI chairman and chief executive Henry Fernandez said. "It's going to be hard for the MSCI to put the A shares into the index because we will not be doing a good service to our clients."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fernandez said capital controls have not yet affected international investors but nonetheless are the biggest potential issue MSCI is monitoring in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last June, MSCI declined to add the A shares to its global emerging markets benchmark index for the third year running, saying China had more to do to open up its market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China has made a lot of progress," Fernandez said, citing the extension of a link between Shanghai and Hong Kong's international market to a US$3 trillion (HK$23.4 trillion) market in Shenzhen. That makes it easier for international investors to access the Chinese stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consultations with Chinese authorities will likely start gearing up after China celebrates its New Year, Fernandez said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, China's currency regulator head Pan Gongsheng assured that foreign companies are not limited to transfer their earnings in China overseas. Pan said the regulator will enhance the supervision on capital outflow, but it encourages capable companies to conduct outbound investment according to rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Financial Times</span><span class="s1"> reported that China's battle against capital flight has extended to payments for goods and services. The branches of several banks in Shenzhen froze the issuance of standby letters of credit during December, according to a notice circulated at a Chinese bank in Hong Kong. The halt came after central regulators told banks to reduce their issuance, the Times reported.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said the loans were apparently intended to pay for the Kai Tak development site.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The price of the Kai Tak site was too high which made it difficult for most local banks to make an efficient evaluation, prompting HNA to raise funds through other approaches," one analyst said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If they think that the development site was worth the price, they are very likely to pay half of the land price," the analyst said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HNA Holding may also find it difficult to source funds from its mainland parent after the central government imposed curbs on capital outflow, the analyst added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its parent, </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, has also pledged shares in certain listed units between November 8 and December 2.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HNA Holding closed 6.35 percent lower at 29 HK cents yesterday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is expected that the first shots in the trade war between world's two biggest economies - China and the United States - will be fired tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Beijing is 12 hours ahead of Washington time, China is expected to retaliate in kind with US$34 billion (HK$265.2 billion) worth of import tariffs on US products at midnight, as Hong Kong moves into the wee hours of the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's investors have suffered tremendously ever since the trade spat erupted. The Hang Seng Index has plunged by around 3,000 points from highs of 31,000, and has become a victim along with A-shares investors in mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> has repeatedly stressed that the recent sharp depreciation of the yuan is not related to the trade dispute, the US dollar has already begun to ease gradually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, as the yuan's fall has been sustained and much sharper rate than the US Dollar Index, it is hard to convince the market that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has no bias towards a weaker yuan. There is no doubt that the decline of the yuan against the US dollar will strengthen the competitive advantage of Chinese exports to the US, which is an important weapon in disguise in the trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the sharp fluctuation of the yuan will put great pressure on the mainland stock market and assets, and it is also likely to trigger capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market, which substantially depends on capital from the mainland, survived but obviously became a "cash dispenser" for mainland funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The A-shares market and the Hong Kong stocks bounced back synchronously last Friday and the A-shares market then fell sharply on Monday. However, the Hang Seng Index dived nearly 1,000 points after mainland investors cashed in Hong Kong shares on Tuesday, the first trading day for Hong Kong in the second half year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With both sides having their fingers on the trigger and Beijing girded for battle, the slump of the yuan will hit China's economy to a great extent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the yuan fell sharply in 2015 and severe capital outflow problems occurred subsequently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is believed that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is closely watching fluctuations in the currency market and wants to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is why the central bank did not choose to intervene in the weak yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several months ago, some senior local officials insisted that the trade war would have little impact on Hong Kong. However as Hong Kong's stock market has close bonds with China, it will also bear the brunt of a trade war. As such investors may escape narrowly only if they sell whatever shares they have, in advance of the deadline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is a part of China, and won't be spared when a trade war is being waged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors should be wary of wild fluctuations in the market - with prices rising and plunging - as the trade war enters the final countdown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I would advise investors looking for bargains not to rush in when prices are low, while those who already own stocks should hang tight until Friday at the very least.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some pundits will probably predict that the Hang Seng Index may be about to bottom out for the short term, after plunging another 1,000 to 2,000 points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Don't take these so-called experts too seriously, because no one knows what might happen next.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Don't forget, the erratic US president Donald Trump is playing the leading role this time round, and as such the situation is even more unpredictable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you are a fan of the World Cup, put aside your market worries for the moment, and just enjoy the game.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has slapped an annual cap on overseas cash withdrawals for UnionPay cardholders at 100,000 yuan (HK$121,740) in an effort to deter money laundering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During October 1 to December 31, the cap has been lowered to 50,000 yuan. SAFE will require banks to record accounts with a withdrawal history exceeding the limit, which will comprise a new watchlist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the implementation of those rules, a UnionPay card was only restricted by a daily cap of 10,000 yuan, or equivalent amount in foreign currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Macau casino shares were hammered, with Sands China (1928) slumping 9.3 percent as UnionPay is a prevalent source of cash withdrawals for mainland gamblers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MGM China (2282) tumbled 8.9 percent while </span><span class="s3">Melco International Development</span><span class="s1"> dipped 8.7 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> warned Macau casinos face a serious challenge as most medium- and high-end gamblers " and even some mass market players " use UnionPay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It estimated at least 30 percent of the funds used to gamble are derived from the card, and the latest restrictions would limit their use.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, the cash withdrawal cap also echoed the previous announcement of restrictions on Chinese capital outflow.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves fell to their lowest level in nearly three years in November, official data showed yesterday, with analysts blaming ``record'' capital outflow on expectations the yuan will depreciate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's foreign exchange stockpile, the world's biggest, declined to US$3.44 trillion (HK$26.67 trillion) last month, down US$87.2 billion from October, according to figures released by the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the lowest figure since US$3.4 trillion in February 2013 and took the total reduction this year to US$404.7 billion. It was also below the median forecast of US$3.49 trillion in a Bloomberg poll of economists.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan fell 70 pips to 6.4708 per US dollar after the announcement. The gap between onshore and offshore yuan widened to more than 631 pips.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard estimated China's net capital outflows at a ``record'' US$113 billion in November, spiking from US$37 billion in October, including the central bank having to sell US$57 billion to prop up the currency's value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The pick-up in capital outflows appears to have been predominately driven by increased expectations for renminbi depreciation,'' he wrote, citing factors including the likelihood of the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> announcing an interest rate hike this month. Beijing keeps a grip on currency flows and the yuan can only move up or down against the US dollar by 2 percent from a mid-rate set daily by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> decided last week to include the yuan in its elite reserve currency basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The country's gold assets were valued at US$59.5 billion, down from US$63.3 billion in October.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong remains the premier offshore yuan trading hub, where for the first time, its settlement system has seen more transactions in the mainland currency than the Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SAR has successfully fended off competition from other offshore yuan centers such as Taiwan and Singapore _ recently permitted to conduct yuan settlements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam told Sing Tao Daily, sister paper of The Standard, that the daily transaction volume of yuan under the Real Time Gross Settlement system reached 390 billion yuan (HK$494 billion) in May, surpassing for the first time the Hong Kong dollar volume of HK$487 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ninety percent of the transactions emanated from inter-offshore markets' activities while only 10 percent came out of mainland-Hong Kong trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, interviewed in New York, believed the volume will keep rising as more trade, investments and credit deals are conducted in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the authority is studying suggestions from the industry to streamline arrangements to boost short-term yuan liquidity. They may include quickening the notice period required for banks to request funds from two business days to one, and shortening the yuan repurchase deals from seven days to one or two days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the shortage of yuan- dominated products is the main thing holding back the further development of yuan business in the SAR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The yuan liquidity pool has reached 800 billion yuan now in Hong Kong, but the channels to use this liquidity are limited.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On mortgages, Chan said the tightening in home loans is not meant to ``destroy the rising cycle'' of local home prices. Rather, it is designed to reduce leverage capital going into the property market, thus slowing its uptrend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Hong Kong's property market will be impacted by rate hikes from the United States,'' he warned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said he did not see much capital outflow from Hong Kong amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve will soon scale back its stimulus plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``There have been rumors the Fed is expected to suspend its quantitative easing plan as recent economic data showed the economy is recovering'' Chan said. ``But the larger the QE program is, the harder and riskier it [is] to exit.''</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange described a dispute with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges over plans to bar investors' access to dual-class shares as temporary, while analysts believe the ban is to stay for the time being.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland exchanges caught investors and Hong Kong stock exchange officials off guard on Saturday when they said they would not allow mainland investors to buy shares in Hong Kong-listed foreign firms, companies with different voting right structures or so-called "stapled" securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, pictured, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said he will fly to Beijing today and discuss the move with Chinese regulators and bourse officials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When you look at the two announcements, it is not about whether to include, it's about when to include - it's about temporarily giving people a chance to look at it, to study how it will work, but the direction of the inclusion is not changing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said any small difference between the exchanges is not going to change Hong Kong's role as a connector between international markets and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts found Li's move pointless and are convinced that the ban is due to Beijing's determination to develop Chinese depository receipts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That's only Li's own wishful thinking," said Shum Chun-ying, chief of Sincere Securities. "The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> will meet with him, but will not change its decision."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He argued that the commission aims to protect mainland investors, given that Xiaomi, the first company to list in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights, failed to answer a long list of questions required by the regulator and withdrew its Chinese depository receipts application last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Thus it still holds a lot of doubts on Xiaomi, and if the company makes it into stock connects, that would still hurt benefits of investors in the country."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides, if Xiaomi does trade in the mainland via Chinese depository receipts, it is not fair on investors who buy Xiaomi now when it is highly overvalued, said director of Phillip Securities Louis Wong Wai-kit. The prohibition has nothing to do with capital outflow, Wong added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign-currency holdings fell by US$22.69 billion (HK$177.74 billion) to US$3.087 trillion in September, as heightened trade tensions with the United States fueled concerns of capital outflow and further yuan depreciation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun- wah does not see capital flight from the SAR as an imminent danger as the Hong Kong dollar is maintaining its strength.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that could change soon enough, he warns in his blog, and he also forecasts a poor annual result for the Exchange Fund for 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the US dollar- pegged Hong Kong dollar turned weak last week, it remains strong overall, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But capital outflow can be expected ``as we had a large amount of inflow'' last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 7.795 against the US dollar on Thursday and Friday " the sharpest two-day depreciation since 1992 " as investors pulled out of the falling stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the local currency is still far from 7.85, the weak side of the convertibility undertaking that would cause the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to sell the US dollar and buy the Hong Kong dollar to maintain stability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for the Exchange Fund, Tsang said he is not optimistic about its performance in 2015 as it suffered a ``triple whammy'' amid global volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang noted that stock markets did little for positive returns last year, bond markets were more stable but lackluster under the low interest rate environment worldwide, while the valuation of the Exchange Fund's non-US dollar assets fell when transferring them into HK dollars due to the US dollar's strength.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund earned HK$27 billion in the first half of last year but lost HK$63.8 in the third quarter due to the local stock market rout.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the return in October could offset the loss in the earlier nine months, Tsang said, the market environment in the past two months went sour again.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, ``we should not worry too much about short-turn volatility,'' Tsang added, because the Exchange Fund is managed in a most prudential manner and is aimed at generating long-term returns for Hong Kong people.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Exchange Fund recorded a net income of HK$6.6 billion in the first quarter of this year, up 8.2 per cent from the previous quarter despite a widening foreign-exchange loss.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund, which has assets over HK$3 trillion to back the Hong Kong dollar, saw net income last quarter 50 percent less than that the fourth quarter last year at HK$13.1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forex investments saw a loss for the fourth quarter in a row _ HK$33.2 billion for the three months ended March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The poor performance was due to significant valuation losses from non-US dollar assets amid a strong US dollar, Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said in a quarterly briefing yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the situation has slightly improved since April, Chan said, as the US dollar appreciates at a slower pace. He believes the forex investments could break even in the longer term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``We have adjusted the forex composition to avoid the losses but we could not cut off all non-US dollar assets,'' he said. Forex losses amounted to HK$52.7 billion for the full year of 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forex loss was offset by strong gains in equities " overseas stocks and local stocks contributed HK$18.5 billion and HK$9.1 billion gains last quarter, up 63.7 percent and nearly 90 percent from the fourth quarter last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bonds gained HK$12.2 billion, down from HK$13.6 billion a quarter earlier. The fund paid HK$11.4 billion to the government in the first quarter this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan noted more than HK$900 billion of capital has flown into Hong Kong since the financial crisis in 2008. There will be capital outflow after the US adopts a normalized interest rate, he said, although the rate is still uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKMA also updated the adjusted earning last year at HK$44.7 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China will hold its annual Central Economic Work Conference next week, with officials saying the gathering is unlikely to produce announcements on tax reduction and increases in benchmark interest rates on deposits and loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their remark comes amid significant progress being achieved in US tax reform and expectations of a </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> rate hikes this year and next.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sheng Songcheng, an adviser to the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said in a speech yesterday that the country's central bank will not narrow the balance sheet and also will not increase benchmark interest rates on deposits and loans. He said the impact on China of the ongoing tax reform in the US and the anticipated Fed rate hikes is limited and can be controlled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before Sheng's speech, the mainland media reported on purported Chinese government plan to draw up contingencies in response to the proposed tax reform in the US and the uptrend in Fed rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese authorities were said to be most worried about the yuan's exchange rate against the greenback, and the central bank was purportedly considering tighter capital controls to stem possible capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New control measures, however, will not be introduced if US tax reform and rising Fed rates will have little impact on China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed US tax reform aims to reduce corporate and income tax rates and induce US firms to bring home profits from overseas at a low tax rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Senate</span><span class="s1"> passed its version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which provides for a major reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po earlier said that Hong Kong will not cut tax rates as the city's profit tax rate now stands at only 16.5 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the target growth for China's economy next year is expected to be set at the Central Economic Work Conference. Mainland analysts forecast target GDP for next year to be set at around 6.5 percent, unchanged from this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conference, which comes just after the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, will be held from December 18 to 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu Yifan, regional chief investment officer and chief China economist at UBS Wealth Management, forecast China's economic growth to hit 6.8 percent this year and to slip to 6.4 percent next year. She noted though that quality growth will be pursued in line with President Xi Jinping's proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu Wenjie, China investment strategist at </span><span class="s3">BlackRock</span><span class="s1">, predicted China will focus more on structural reform next year instead of economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is reported that the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> may be looking at ways to free up credit, in addition to cutting interest rates or a comprehensive capital-reservation reduction policy, following some of the European financial crisis measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of these is to allow Chinese banks to swap bonds issued by local governments for cash to boost liquidity and lending activity. Actually it is better to say that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has its own version rather than to simply following that of the </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Exchanging local government bonds for cash may seem similar to the ECB's longer-term refinancing operation, or LTRO. At the end of 2011, the ECB issued billions of euros, via LTROs, to troubled European banks offering them three-year, low-cost loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the Chinese version of the LTRO is designed to ensure that the banking system has sufficient liquidity. The reasons for insufficient liquidity are many, and one obvious sign is capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital flows data indicate that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s balance sheet in the first quarter fell by 251.1 billion yuan (HK$314.12 billion), creating a record drop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under a debt-for-bond swap program, local governments are allowed to issue 1 trillion yuan in special debt to replace expiring debt (mainly bank loans) into bonds that carry lower yields and with longer maturities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will result in annual savings of up to 50 billion yuan in interest payments for local governments. Commercial banks will become the main buyers of the special local government debt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This can ease the pressure on risky loans. However, the problem is this: will there be an increase in bank loans when the potential bad debt risk of banks declines? At the same time will the economy benefit from it? Will the money not be drained? This will be the topic next week. Andrew Wong Wai-hong is an independent commentator.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of the yuan has temporarily stabilized at around 6.6 per US dollar. The central government is trying to impose more restrictions, but capital outflow pressures persist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to market consensus, the yuan is expected to depreciate further in 2016 to the range of 6.8 to 7.5, in a slow and controllable manner. If the currency keeps falling, it will take more time for China and Hong Kong stocks to mount a recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> (0005) has imposed a hiring and salary freeze in 2016. The stock rebounded slightly to HK$54.65, though it is still near a six- year low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local banks have been facing earlier loan repayments from mainland companies in the past year. The yuan's depreciation has forced mainland enterprises to repay their US dollar loans early and switch to borrowing from domestic lenders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland banks are still keen to lend aggressively to large Chinese enterprises. You should probably reduce such stocks in your portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for Chinese banks paying a dividend yield as high as 6-7 percent, buying on dips and trading within a range seems to be the best strategy.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Home deals in the primary and secondary market are expected to drop further following Donald Trump's election victory, but it might not be all bad news, industry experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The situation of Trump winning the American presidency is similar to Brexit, Centaline Property Agency founder Shih Wing-ching said yesterday, as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> might delay raising interest rates - therefore prompting capital to continue flowing into the local property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shih said the home market was already in a "wait-and-see" mode after introduction of the latest cooling measures last week, and he expects prices to fall 3 to 5 percent until starting to recover in the second quarter next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Volatility in the market can be expected, and home deals in both the primary and secondary market will go down in the short term following the latest cooling measures and Trump's presidency," said Midland Realty chief analyst Buggle Lau Ka-fai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Performance of the local home market in the mid-to-long term will depend on expectations over the US interest rate, and whether Trump's policies, such as levying taxes on Chinese exports, will affect the mainland's economy," Lau added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Lau noted that an expectation of further yuan depreciation may lead to more capital outflow from the mainland into the SAR's luxury home and commercial property markets."Due to uncertainties and volatility in the global market, capital might flow towards risk-averse assets, and the property market will be one of those options," said Knight Frank senior director, Thomas Lam Ho-man.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Terence Chong Tai-leung, executive director of the Institute of Global Economics and Finance at Chinese University of Hong Kong, believes Trump will adopt a pragmatic approach once in office.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chong said the major factor affecting the local market remains the latest cooling measures, which have caused secondary home deals to "freeze."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many homeowners are taking the attitude that they will not be selling unless the price is good, and as a result, many are looking to rent out their flats instead," said Centaline branch manager Buddy Ching.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong, Shanghai and Sydney property prices have reached risky levels, says S&amp;P Global Ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Asset prices, especially property prices, today are as stretched as they were before the Asian crisis," Elena Okorochenko, head of Asia-Pacific ratings, said at a conference in Singapore yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Combined with increased household debt, prices in Sydney, Hong Kong and Shanghai appear stretched. "It's a risk worth monitoring," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Home prices in Sydney have surged 75 percent in the past five years, ranking it as the world's second most-expensive housing market behind Hong Kong, where prices climbed 21 percent in the year through June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> report said the growth rate in Hong Kong home prices peaked in June and a zero growth rate is expected by the end of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report said that the sound economic performance in Hong Kong, together with mortgage plans offered by the developers in the first-hand residential market, have supported the current home prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it said risks remain in the property market as the Hong Kong Inter- Bank Offered Rate is rising close to the London inter-bank rate, which would lead to a higher cost for borrowing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A steady increase in housing supply, as well as recent capital outflow control imposed by the Chinese government to mainland developers, could help suppress land and home prices in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, a 26,925-square-foot site in Stanley which comprises a luxury project is to sell by tender, said property consultant JLL.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The site has a plot ratio of 0.75, which represents a maximum gross floor area of about 20,194 sq ft. Located at 20 Stanley Village Road, the estimated per-square-foot price for the site is HK$37,000 to HK$38,000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vista Stanley was completed in 1974 and comprises two three-level mansions, with 12 apartments sized at 1,608 sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the secondary market, a 1,114-square-foot flat at Pine Mansion in Taikoo Shing was sold recently for HK$22 million, or HK$19,748 per sq- ft - HK$1 million lower than the asking price - according to Centaline Property Agency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The seller purchased the four- bedroom home for HK$950,000 back in 1982.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Happy Valley, a 661-sq-ft home at 13 King Kwong Street was sold for HK$7.2 million, or HK$10,893 per sq ft, 10 percent lower than the asking price, says Ricacorp Properties. In June, the price of the three-bedroom apartment was listed at HK$8 million.</span></p>
