<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar rose sharply yesterday amid the rally in local stocks, thanks to capital flow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The local currency hit 7.75 to the US dollar " the strong side of convertibility undertakings " twice during trading time in London yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> (0023) analyst of currency and exchange rate Lai Chun-mui expects the unit to remain strong in the short term and stay near 7.75 if the capital inflow continues. The trading volume of local stocks climbed to a record high and the southbound trading quota for the Stock Connect was used up for the first time yesterday, reflecting strong demand for the Hong Kong dollar, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The aggregate balance of the local currency will therefore be pushed higher, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The unit opened at 7.7520 to the US dollar yesterday in Hong Kong. During London trade, it strengthened rapidly, reaching 7.7500 twice around 6pm, and slid to 7.7502 at 9pm.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Market expectations of the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> putting off raising interest rates dragged the greenback lower, also helping to boost the local currency, </span><span class="s3">Wing Lung Bank</span><span class="s1"> treasurer Terry Siu Kai-hung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Siu believes most of the capital inflow yesterday came from across the border, as the government launched easing measures to allow more mainland capital to invest in local stocks. He said the HK dollar will remain strong in the short term. STAFF REPORTER</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and China stocks rose yesterday as investors await a decision by US index provider MSCI, which will decide early tomorrow [Hong Kong time] whether to include A shares in its Emerging Market Index.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks had their best day in nearly six weeks, led by IT and financial shares, as investors welcomed a plan for a new board to attract "new economy" listings - which would benefit investment banks and put vigor in the tech sector.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose 1.2 percent to 25,924.55 while the China Enterprises Index gained 1.3 percent to 10,520.80 points.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's stock regulator said it would be happy with an MSCI index inclusion, but the mainland's capital market reform will not be derailed without the inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The inclusion could bring about 60.7 billion yuan [HK$69.48 billion] into the [A-share] market, but the impact would be limited if the inclusion does not happen," </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1"> wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> expects the inclusion to bring about a capital inflow of about US$8 billion (HK$62.4 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, the bank believes the investment atmosphere will be more important than capital inflow and that mainland investors might buy more blue chip shares on expectation that overseas companies will increase holdings should the inclusion occurs.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said in a report that there is more than a 50 percent chance that A shares would be included in the MSCI index but the short-term impact will be limited.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange unveiled a long-awaited proposal for a new stock listing board on Friday that will offer special voting rights and waive profitability requirements, in a drive to attract firms that typically choose New York over the Hong Kong bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The proposal for a third board for "new economy" firms would let </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) make a play for secondary listings from Chinese firms such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1">. They were drawn to New York due to less stringent rules on profitability and share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Technology stocks rose sharply, with an index tracking the sector up roughly 2 percent. Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent gained 2.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China stocks rose on signs that tight liquidity conditions were easing and on expectations of fewer new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The CSI300 index rose 1.0 percent to 3,553.67 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.7 percent to 3,144.37.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing should not wait for the market to stabilise to launch the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect scheme and should introduce it as soon as possible to help attract more capital inflow to the mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chairman Chow Chung-kong said last Thursday, on the first trading day of the Year of the Monkey, that the long-awaited stock connect scheme between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets would definitely be launched but it would need to wait for the stock market to stabilise.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">After the Hang Seng Index lost more than 700 points on Thursday in the biggest fall on the first trading day of a Lunar New Year since 1994, brokers interpreted his remarks as meaning the scheme would be launched in the second half of this year at the earliest.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But that would not be appropriate because any broker will tell you investors like to trade when the markets have big movements instead of in quiet markets. Even in a falling market, people like to buy when the share prices drop to more reasonable levels.It should be left to investors and not the regulators to decide when it is appropriate to enter the market</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As such, the mainland regulator should launch the new scheme whenever the platform and regulatory measures are ready and not when the market is stable. It should be left to investors and not the regulators to decide when it is appropriate to enter the market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Then there's the capital flow issue. The depreciation of the yuan, which dropped more than 5 per cent against the US dollar last year and is expected to fall further this year, has led to many mainlanders rushing to buy US dollar or Hong Kong dollar investment products and life insurance policies to hedge their risks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect would not worsen the situation because most mainland investors have accounts in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Investors who want to trade Hong Kong stocks could already have done so by trading via the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect would, however, open a new leg and new market for northbound trading - with international investors able to trade Shenzhen-listed companies in addition to Shanghai A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A recent survey by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> found international investors were interested in the Shenzhen stock markets because it is home to many potential high growth companies. Retail brokers in Hong Kong would also like to see Hong Kong investors allowed to trade Shenzhen stocks because it would boost their commission income.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That means the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect is likely to result in new capital inflow to mainland China from both international fund houses and Hong Kong retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">More importantly, many fund managers believe that a precondition for A shares to be added to </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1">'s benchmark emerging markets index is giving them the ability to trade in the Shenzhen stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> said in June last year that its decision to defer the inclusion of A shares in its global emerging market benchmarks for a second year reflected lingering investor concerns over market accessibility.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">If Beijing allows the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect to be launched soon, it would boost the chances of A shares being included in </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> indices. And that would lead to more exchange traded funds buying A shares, further boosting capital inflow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There is really no need to wait for the market to stabilise before launching the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chinese authorities will have to solve several thorny issues facing the nation's US$7 trillion bond market, from price distortion to infrastructure insufficiencies, before it can become a true global market and a new channel to attract international capital inflow, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A bond connect scheme linking the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong will launch this year, allowing foreign investors to trade bonds on the mainland through Hong Kong and vice versa, Chinese premier Li Keqiang announced in mid March.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Later media reports said the new scheme would allow foreign investors to access the world's second largest debt market by the end of this year, without the need to comply with a number of onshore procedures and formalities that are currently in place.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At present, bonds in China are traded on the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) and the domestic stock exchanges, with the CIBM capturing the lion's share of the bond market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China had opened CIBM to eligible foreign investors in February 2016, so many analysts expected the new scheme would include stock exchange traded bonds. However, a series of fundamental issues should be tackled to make the market attractive to foreign investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland-Hong Kong bond connect is just the first step, says forex chief[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2082238/mainland-hong-kong-bond-connect-just-first-step-says-forex]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">First of all, Chinese authorities will have to remove the "implicit guarantee" from the bond market to kick start a successful connect programme, said Ding Yuan, vice president and dean of the Shanghai-based China Europe International Business School (CEIBS).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The assumption that governments will not allow defaults to happen is the "implicit guarantee", which largely distorts the price of Chinese bonds, Ding said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The vast majority of bonds in mainland China are rated as triple A by mainland rating agencies. If you ask them why the rating is so high, they explain it is because these are state-owned giants, with credit underwritten by the government," Ding said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"If foreign investors don't buy into this pricing mechanism then China will not see the capital inflow it wants, no matter how the authority designs and promote the new scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"However, if foreign investors jump into the casino and bet on the ‘implicit guarantee', China will have to cope with a monster nurtured by huge capital inflows based on government buyout assumptions," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Bond Connect needs to be launched as soon as possible[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2068381/bond-connect-needs-be-launched-soon-possible]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There is also key infrastructure lacking from the current bond trading system, said Ivan Chung, senior analyst with rating agency </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1">, referring to an open quotation platform.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Unlike stocks, the trading of bonds is usually completed through an over-the-counter market</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Right now, many domestic trading parties rely on </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> groups to negotiate and decide the prices. I am not sure if international investors could deal with this," Chung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">An open quotation platform must be set up to guarantee the transparency of pricing and the reduction of transaction costs, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Besides market accessibility, a major obstacle that has prevented foreign investors from embracing yuan bonds is the concern about currency depreciation," said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Manager.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Restoring investor confidence in China's macro outlook can help dissipate yuan pessimism, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">On the other hand, it is important to offer investors currency hedging tools, Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">in February opened up the onshore derivative markets to CIBM investors for the purpose of currency hedging, which was to address the demand of international bond traders in China's market, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Foreign investors have been able to access Chinese bonds via the CIBM market since last year, and earlier through the QFII (qualified foreign institutional investor) and RQFII (renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor) programmes, but the bond connect scheme would open up a bigger universe of bond products, expand the capital inflow and outflow quotas, and simplify the trading process.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The announcement of the bond connect initiative comes more than two years after Beijing launched the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the first cross-border securities trading and clearing link, in November 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chinese authorities further expanded foreign investor access with the opening of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in November 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's bond market is the third largest in the world, estimated at around US$7 trillion, according to a </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> report published in March.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, foreign investors account for less than 2 per cent of the market, underlining the potential for growth if access is made easier.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">When it comes to the size of corporate credit, China is now second only to the US.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">What's being claimed by US president Donald Trump as the "greatest witch hunt" in political history - the probe into any of his White House staff's ties with Russia - is also being viewed as positive news for the outlook of the yuan, and other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Former FBI director Robert Mueller, widely respected for his independence in high-profile government investigations, has been named a special counsel to oversee the latest scrutiny of the new administration, "escalating the political uncertainties faced by Trump, about his ties with Russia, over his election win and his other issues", said Jasper Lo Cho-yan, chief strategist at King International Financial.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"This will affect many of his policies, including his call for interest rate rises.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"This is bad news for the US dollar but good news for the yuan and other currencies, as this may slow down the pace of the US interest rate rises."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While many analysts believe the next rate rise will come as early as June, Lo believes it may now be delayed as a result, thus helping the yuan's rally to continue for the rest of this year, and testing its current average level of around 6.77 yuan to the greenback, which would represent another 1.5 per cent further increase from its current level, or a 2.8 per cent increase this year as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Beijing has just approved the Bond Connect scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland, starting only with northbound trading, which should lead to international buyers investing in the mainland bond market, improving capital inflow. These will also support the yuan," Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The currency has bounced back from three consecutive years of falls in value. Onshore yuan now trades at 6.8922 yuan per US dollar, up 0.7 per cent this year after falling 7 per cent last year, the biggest annual fall since records started in 1994. It dropped 4.63 per cent in 2015 and 2.49 per cent in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong rose 1.31 per cent this year after falling 6.16 per cent last year, 5.67 per cent in 2015, and 2.64 per cent in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">What's being claimed by US president Donald Trump as the “greatest witch hunt” in political history - the probe into any of his White House staff's ties with Russia - is also being viewed as positive news for the outlook of the yuan, and other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Former FBI director Robert Mueller, widely respected for his independence in high-profile government investigations, has been named a special counsel to oversee the latest scrutiny of the new administration, “escalating the political uncertainties faced by Trump, about his ties with Russia, over his election win and his other issues”, said Jasper Lo Cho-yan, chief strategist at King International Financial.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This will affect many of his policies, including his call for interest rate rises.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This is bad news for the US dollar but good news for the yuan and other currencies, as this may slow down the pace of the US interest rate rises.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While many analysts believe the next rate rise will come as early as June, Lo believes it may now be delayed as a result, thus helping the yuan's rally to continue for the rest of this year, and testing its current average level of around 6.77 yuan to the greenback, which would represent another 1.5 per cent further increase from its current level, or a 2.8 per cent increase this year as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Beijing has just approved the Bond Connect scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland, starting only with northbound trading, which should lead to international buyers investing in the mainland bond market, improving capital inflow. These will also support the yuan,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The currency has bounced back from three consecutive years of falls in value. Onshore yuan now trades at 6.8922 yuan per US dollar, up 0.7 per cent this year after falling 7 per cent last year, the biggest annual fall since records started in 1994. It dropped 4.63 per cent in 2015 and 2.49 per cent in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong rose 1.31 per cent this year after falling 6.16 per cent last year, 5.67 per cent in 2015, and 2.64 per cent in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International, said this shows the worst is over for the Chinese currency.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Landing International Development (0582) and </span><span class="s3">Genting Singapore</span><span class="s1">'s joint project Resorts World Jeju in South Korea started construction yesterday and is expected to open in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The hotel and casino resort on Jeju Island, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the region, involves an investment of US$1.8 billion (HK$13.95 billion). Occupying an area of 2.5 million square meters, part of Jeju's largest tourism resort will be open in 2017 and the entire development will be completed in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The project features the largest casino in Jeju at 10,000 square meters. It also includes luxury hotels with 2,000 rooms, a theme park, villas and flats, food and retail complexes as well as exhibition and entertainment facilities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Jeju attracts about 10 million visitors a year, with around a quarter of them from abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Won Hee Ryong, governor of Jeju special self- governing province, earlier suspended the construction of the project with media reporting that he was worried the large China capital inflow would affect the local economy. Won explained that was not the reason _ rather, it was the unclear information such as number of hotel rooms and lack of information on gaming business.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Separately, Reuters reported that Chow Tai Fook Enterprises plans to invest US$2.6 billion (HK$20.28 billion) to build a casino resort in Incheon, South Korea. ELISE CHOI</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong neither intends nor plans to change its linked currency exchange rate to the US dollar, with Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah saying in his blog yesterday that it is the best arrangement for the SAR.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will buy Hong Kong dollars and sell the greenback once the local currency weakens to 7.85, the weak side of the HKMA's convertibility undertaking, Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The local currency hit 7.8259 last week from 7.7503 at the start of the year, sparking fears of an end to a link that puts the local dollar in a 7.75-7.85 range. The currency stood at 7.7967 on Friday after a one-day rebound of 0.27 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``Both the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and the net capital outflow are within our expectations after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> started interest rate hikes last year,'' Tsang said. ``The two are inevitable during the process of normalization of local interest rates.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The correction of local stocks, the volatility of the yuan and some international investors' use of currency hedges against their Hong Kong stocks portfolio also added pressure to the Hong Kong dollar's depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``But there is no need to overreact and worry,'' Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A continuing capital inflow since 2008 has helped the authority to accumulate foreign reserves of more than US$130 billion (HK$1.01 trillion), with an increase in the local monetary base to HK$1 trillion. The capital is sufficient for maintaining Hong Kong dollar stability when outflow occurs, as well as for mild interest rate rises.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A stable exchange rate helps risk control and promotes trading and financial activities. Hong Kong has no intention to change the peg system, Tsang said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland stocks fell the most in 10 weeks on concerns the government will not ease monetary policy as quickly as anticipated after the US Federal Reserve launched its third round of quantitative easing last week.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index plunged 2.1 percent yesterday to 2,078.50, the sharpest decline since July 9.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``QE3 will definitely increase liquidity in the financial market, which will boost commodity prices. This is obviously negative for China _ a major importer of bulk commodities,'' China Securities Journal said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The resulting inflation will make it harder for small and medium-sized businesses to survive, and slow down the pace of economic recovery, it warned in an editorial.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It said inflation will narrow the leeway for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to fine-tune economic development by lowering interest rates and reserve requirements for banks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China suffered more than a 6 percent gain in its consumer price index for four months in a row last year, a result of inflowing speculative capital released by the previous two rounds of quantitative easing and the four trillion yuan (HK$4.9 trillion) stimulus package initiated by Beijing soon after the start of the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The CPI eased a bit in the past few months, but then rebounded slightly last month to a 2 percent rise from a 1.7 percent gain in July.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Liu Mingkang, former chairman at the China Banking Regulatory Commission described the Fed as being ``irresponsible'' to the United States and China, for launching QE3, which will raise the risk of asset bubbles in the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The ``hot money'' will find its way to China and boost property prices, which the government has tried hard to control in the past two years, said Guo Tianyong, a professor at Central University of Finance and Economics.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, Chen Xingdong, chief economist at BNP Paribas Securities, said the capital inflow could ease the worsening capital outflows from China.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> published a report saying that the inflow of capital from the mainland has become the most important source of funds for the local market, exceeding both the active and exchange traded funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A total of US$7 billion (HK$54.6 billion) net capital inflow from the mainland has been accumulated in the local market since the beginning of the year. That of ETFs stood at US$1.6 billion while a net outflow of US$1 billion was seen in the period for active funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The fund house expects a US$54 billion southbound inflow this year and another US$51 billion next year. Hong Kong shares would see 5 percent held by mainland capital by next year, up from the current 1.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks were firm yesterday, as Tencent led tech shares higher for the second day, after Beijing identified the sector as key to China's economic restructuring.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Sentiment was also lifted by a sharp rebound in rate-sensitive property stocks, as investors regained their composure after a sell-off on Monday triggered by the prospect of a US interest rate hike next week.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose 0.4 percent to 23,681, while the China Enterprises Index gained 0.6 percent to 10,229 points.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A flurry of data in coming weeks is expected to show China posted solid economic growth in February, even as the government trimmed its growth target for the year to focus on containing the risks from a rapid build-up in debt.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This has helped counter worries from a looming US rate hike. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted last Friday that the central bank will raise interest rates at its meeting next week.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Tencent has also teamed up with NavInfo, a Shenzhen-listed digital mapping company, and GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, for the purchase of a 10 percent stake in Here, a digital mapping company controlled by Germany's leading carmakers.</span></p>

The lender was the most actively traded stock yesterday, accounting for about a tenth of the total market turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shares of other China banks also advanced following news about the mainland banking regulator's proposal to reduce lenders' reserve requirement ratio, or a portion of deposits that they need to set aside for safekeeping.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> injected another HK$2.33 billion to the market yesterday as the local currency strengthened with capital inflow due to the US Federal Reserve continuing tapering and affecting fund flow to the market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The de facto central bank stepped into the market for the 16th time since July 1 as the Hong Kong dollar hit the strong end of 7.75 against the US dollar, injecting altogether HK$56.92 billion. The latest intervention will lift the aggregate balance _ the sum of balances on clearing accounts maintained by banks with the HKMA _ to HK$228.92 billion on August 4.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The HKMA earlier said the inflow of capital may be due to recent mergers and acquisitions, as well as dividend payout activities which exceed HK$300 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The intervention came when the </span><span class="s3">Fed</span><span class="s1"> said it is paring its monthly bond purchases by another US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) to US$25 billion on Wednesday evening. The purchases have been intended to keep long-term borrowing rates low and are set to end in October. The statement also said the </span><span class="s3">Fed</span><span class="s1">'s key short-term rate would likely remain at a record low near zero ``for a considerable time'' after its bond purchases end.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The authority warned investors, banks, corporations, and individuals to avoid borrowing too much and to manage liquidity carefully.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Also, the HKMA announced yuan deposits fell 3.1 percent to 925.91 billion yuan (HK$1.16 trillion) as of end of June, a second consecutive month-on-month decline. A HKMA spokesman said the drop was mainly due to decrease from corporate deposits while those of individual remains stable. ``As Hong Kong offshore yuan market is getting mature, it is natural to see increase and decrease of the currency deposit.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Cross border trade settlement amounted to 2.93 trillion yuan as of end of June, 73 percent increase from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan declined 30 basis points to 6.1747 against the US dollar yesterday, after climbing for seven consecutive days to a 4.5 month high. The yuan strengthened 0.49 percent in July.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Further monetary easing may be on the way if new bank lending this month in the mainland falls from January levels and capital inflows ease, economists said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``If net capital inflow totaled 2.5 trillion yuan [HK$3.07 trillion] this year, the central bank would adopt two additional cuts in the bank required reserve ratio this year,'' said ANZ head of Greater China Economic Research Liu Ligang. ``But if February's new lending further declines, the ratio reduction can be expected at the end of March.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">New loans last month totaled 738.1 billion yuan, down 28 percent from a year back. Foreign capital also started to flow back to the mainland last month after outflows continued for three consecutive months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As for the property market, Liu said Beijing is likely to replace property tax with purchase restrictions by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``The government does not mean to defeat the property market. As housing prices have corrected to a relatively reasonable level, it is time for the regulator to loosen up.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Liu forecast gross domestic this year at 9 percent, easing from 9.2 percent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">His estimate is higher than the 8 percent growth the market expects.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``The leadership change will boost economic growth,'' Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">ANZ's senior economist Raymond Yeung Yu-ting said the yuan could appreciate at a slower pace this year, gaining 3 percent against the US dollar. Local yuan deposits will rebound and may hit 900 billion yuan by year-end.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This would be due to rising cross-border trade settlement and yuan internationalization.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But yuan loans in Hong Kong are likely to fall this year, from 30.8 billion yuan lent last year, due to tepid demand amid shrinking spread between onshore and offshore yuan, Yeung added.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The pound dived to fresh 31-year lows yesterday, bond yields were squeezed and equities hammered as the growing shadow of the Brexit vote over the global economy sent traders fleeing to safety.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Safe-haven assets gold and silver reached two-year highs while yields on high-quality government bonds dropped further, and the yen and the Swiss franc rose again.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The pound, however, sank to US$1.2798 at one point, its lowest level since June 1985, before bouncing back up above US$1.29.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Just when you thought it was 'safe to go back in the water', the pound got pounded as speculation around Brexit forms into something more concrete,'' said Stephen Innes, senior trader at </span><span class="s3">OANDA</span><span class="s1"> Asia Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">London's FTSE 100 index was down 1.4 percent in mid-afternoon trading, while Frankfurt's DAX 30 and the CAC 40 in Paris both dropped by 1.8 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shares in </span><span class="s3">Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena</span><span class="s1"> rebounded in Milan after two straight session of heavy losses on hopes that the Italian government will help find a solution to the bank's debt problems.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some analysts fear a bank crisis in Italy and eurozone turmoil are looming.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wall Street opened slightly easier, but quickly slid further down. Japan's Nikkei stock index closed down 1.9 percent - having shed more than three percent at one point - while Hong Kong lost 1.2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Gold rose to US$1,375.45 (HK$10,278.51) per ounce in mid- session trading in London, its highest level since March 17, 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As for the local market, </span><span class="s3">Societe Generale</span><span class="s1"> said less capital flowed into local warrant and callable bull/bear contracts after the Brexit vote and investors exited their positions in the earlier short-lived rebound in stock market.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In almost a repeat of China's massive stimulus injection following the 2008 financial crisis, mainland municipal governments have rushed to boost infrastructure spending in a bid to maintain economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Amid central government assurances for growth _ made explicit by Premier Li Keqiang's promise of a 7 percent ``bottom line'' _ at least 10 provincial or municipal governments have recently approved infrastructure projects, the 21st Century Business Herald reported yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Local governments usually choose urban rail projects because they suit the development objective of the central government, and stand a better chance of securing funding, analysts said. It is estimated rail investments for 6,000 kilometers by 2020 could reach up to 4 trillion yuan (HK$5 trillion) in cities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chongqing approved two rail line projects, with estimated investment of 35.5 billion yuan on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mega-city plans to spend at least 660 billion yuan on infrastructure in the second half, up 20 percent from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lanzhou city in the western province of Gansu approved a metro line project requiring investment of 18.9 billion yuan, while Zhuhai will invest 850 million yuan for its scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Other provinces include Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan and Guizhou, while other projects include redevelopment of squatter homes.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The news boosted long-depressed cement shares yesterday. Anhui Conch (0914) rose 3.3 percent while Shanshui Cement (0691) jumped 7.8 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Highway stocks also saw capital inflow as Sichuan Expressway (0107) gained 5 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, Paul Tang Sai-on, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> (0023), warned that the central government should avoid launching huge investments _ as it did in the past _ to lift economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Property tycoon Tang Shing Bor said he feels no threat to Hong Kong's property market in the coming two years due to still-expensive land prices and constant capital inflow to the SAR.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, HSBC Asia-Pacific chief executive Peter Wong Tung-shun shared the same view.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wong said interest rates remain relatively low here, and property prices are unlikely to fall massively - even if the Hong Kong Interbank Rate surges more than 2 percent, the Hong Kong Economic Times reported.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Among various kinds of property, veteran investor Tang said he is positive about livelihood such as nursing homes, adding that such property prices have bottomed out and would rise slowly.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Also, prices of industrial buildings remain low, so he has hopes of turning such premises into more active properties.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Tang called on the government to work with developers to help ease the tight supply of residential property. For example, the administration can allow developers to transform those industrial buildings into short-term rental housing, while setting a limit on the rents charged. His company, Gorth Management, and Stan Group - chaired by his son Stan Tang - have together turned one of its industrial buildings in Tuen Mun into a 430-room hotel, which is expected to open in mid-year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The veteran investor also forecast that supply of new hotels will be very limited, as investing in hotels is a low-liquidity game which means it is hard to cash out quickly. That's why many investors have turned to office buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Stan Group is looking to have its operating business listed in 2021.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, A 4,733 saleable square foot house from the Pokfulam Peak project, completed by Vantage International (0015), was recently sold for HK$295 million, or about HK$60,200 per ssf, according to the Lands Registry.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The deal also include three parking spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Yuen Long, a 4,115 ssf house from New World Development's (0017) Park Villa project fetched HK$48.55 million, or HK$11,800 per ssf, the highest in the development. The house also comprises a 1,300 sq-ft garden and a 867 sq ft rooftop deck.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Tai Po, a foreclosure house from the Beverly Hills was listed at HK$27.8 million, or HK$11,300 per ssf, about 22 percent lower than the HK$36 million the owner paid seven years ago, according to Century 21.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Separately, </span><span class="s3">Colliers International</span><span class="s1"> was appointed as sole agent of the public tender for the sale of 140 Waterloo Road in Kowloon Tong. The luxury property located on the 10,028 sq ft site is a 49-year-old, three story building.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">According to the town planning information, the plot ratio can reach 1.8 times, with a maximum gross floor area of 18,050 sq ft, allowing construction of an independent or semi-detached houses with gardens on the site.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The closing auction session will be officially relaunched in the stock market today and analysts believe it may lead to a short-term tumble.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some retail investors are also unaware of the session. The eight minute session starts automatically after the 4pm close. In that time investors can trade normally and the market will then close at any time between 4.08pm and 4.10pm. The exact closing time is determined randomly and varies every day.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) said the extended session will provide a fairer closing price for benchmarking. Previous closing prices without the auction session have been determined by five snapshot prices in the last minute before the market closed.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Only Hang Seng Index constituent stocks, exchanged traded funds and H shares that are also listed in the mainland are up for trade in the session.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"There could be potential chaos," said Tung Shing Securities analyst Ivan Li Sing-yeung. "There was no Shanghai-Shenzhen stock exchange when the exchange implemented the closing auction session.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Li said the extra channel of capital inflow may lead to market falls.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2008, the exchange introduced CAS to the market, but during one continuous trading session, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> (0005) was sold down from HK$38.98 to HK$33, at which point trading was halted.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But this time there is a bidding price li-mit, set at a 5 percent range of the reference price at 4 pm (the previous closing price).</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Office rents in the greater Central district are the highest in the world for the second year. They rose 7.5 percent this year, driven by robust demand from Chinese institutions and limited availability, says </span><span class="s3">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Rents of grade A offices in Central hit HK$143.6 per square foot a month in the fourth quarter, a 2.7 percent quarterly growth and 7 percent year-on-year increase. China companies have taken 54 percent of this year's contracted rentable area while bank and financial companies were the main reason for the records, managing director John Siu said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Supported by these companies, office rents in Central could gain 7-9 percent next year, while 3-5 percent growth will occur in Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Island East, Siu expects.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, rents in Kowloon East are likely to fall by 4-5 percent, with 11.5 percent rent availability.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There will be eight million square feet of office supply, which will push up the region's overall office rent availability in the next five years, while only 600,000 million sq ft of new office buildings will come to the Central area in 2002.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">For retail leasing, rents will be stable from the first half of next year. They might climb by 2 percent in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui if retail sales are positive, said the consultancy executive director and head of retail services Kevin Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As the number of visitors bounced back this year, decreases in retail rents have narrowed. Causeway Bay has fallen only 3.3 percent this year and Tsim Sha Tsui 3.4 percent.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``If the US dollar remains strong as it is now, we expect by the end of the year, forex hedged ETFs will become even more popular, especially against Asian currencies, like the yen and won,'' said Marco Montanari, head of Asia Pacific passive asset management.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Many European or American pension funds are also keen on investing in A shares in the near future, noted Thorsten Michalik, head of global client group in passive investment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The number of ETFs in Europe tracking Chinese shares is still very limited, accounting for 1.9 percent, or US$5 billion, of assets under management of all listed ETFs in Europe. With the opening up of the cross- border trading link and renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor scheme, there is great potential for ETF development in Hong Kong, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks rose for the fourth straight day yesterday to a fresh two-year high, as investors responded positively to China's solid trade data and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's signal to adopt a patient approach to rate- tightening.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index jumped 1.2 percent, to 26,346, while the China Enterprises Index gained 1.5 percent, to 10,677.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's stock market also posted gains with Shanghai Composite up 0.6 percent to 3,218.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong blue-chip stocks were on the rise. HKex rose 3 percent to HK$208.8 and Tencent was up 1.1 percent. Local property stocks also made gains.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong's stock market has been on the rise over the previous few days and Yellen's testimony brings further momentum to the market," said First Shanghai Securities chief strategist Linus Yip Sheung-chi.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alex Wong Kwok-ying, director of Ample Finance Group, said the breakthrough in HKEx's stock price might be an indication that market turnover would continue to go up.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He expects the Hong Kong stock market to go up gradually in the coming few weeks and that the Hang Seng Index could reach 27,000 points.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The up-cycle of the US dollar is likely close to ending in terms of duration and valuation, but it is likely to remain strong on the back of robust US growth and the outlook for inflation, said Luc Luyet, FX strategist at Pictet Wealth Management.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> remained cautious on the US dollar, however. The government bond and who will succeed Yellen are the two main factors of change for the US dollar, according to Tan Teck-leng, APAC forex analyst at UBS Wealth Management CIO.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said the US dollar index is highly related to euros which accounted for 60 percent of the index. Since the euro is expected to rise 4 percent to 1.2 against the US dollar in the next 12 months, the US dollar index was seen dropping to 93 or 94.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The spot US dollar index was at 95.7 at 5pm yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Tan also expects the Hong Kong dollar to hover between 7.81 and 7.82 against the US dollar in the next six months. The increasing gap between Hibor and Libor, and the increasing capital inflow to the city would drive the currency low.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan is expected not to fall to above seven by year-end due to the relatively stable economic environment in China. But as China's government is expected to make long-term structural adjustment to the economy, the GDP slowdown could lead the yuan to fall to 7.1 in 12 months time.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Benjamin Hung Pi-cheng, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1"> (Hong Kong) executive director and chief executive officer, sees more capital inflows into the territory driving down the local savings rate.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Thanks to the quantitative easing launched by central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan, the effective exchange rate index for the Hong Kong dollar now stands at a two-year high of 7.752 to 7.753.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``Capital, whether in Hong Kong dollars, yuan or US dollars, has been flowing into the SAR this week,'' said Hung.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But foreign investors will take a more cautious attitude towards their investments in the Asia-Pacific region, Hung warned, due to the slowdown in China's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``A-shares have dropped 6 to 7 percent year to date compared to the 5 to 10 percent rise in foreign stock markets.'' This has lowered the appetite of foreign investors for mainland assets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's latest mortgage- tightening measures, Hung believes they will hurt speculators in the short term and not have too much impact on end users.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hot money will continue to flow to Hong Kong for the time being, raising the risk of a sudden outflow and a plunge in asset values, Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah has warned.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the latest posting on his blog, Tsang wrote that there was no direct correlation between hot money inflows and roaring property prices as local flat prices had been surging even before the capital influx.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``Market sentiment was bullish since the US Federal Reserve announced the third phase of quantitative easing. Such sentiment is dangerous as it goes against the local trend of economic slowdown.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Following measures launched on Friday, the government could take further initiatives to cool the local property market and crack down on speculators, he wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``The world economic outlook now is even more uncertain than in 2008 and 2009 during the financial tsunami. It is difficult to predict how much more hot money will come to Hong Kong and when the situation will reverse.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Tsang expects inflows to help maintain a strong tone in the Hong Kong dollar. The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has injected a total of HK$14.361 billion in four interventions from October 20 to October 24 to maintain the US dollar peg.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``No ceiling is set for the HKMA to buy US dollars and sell Hong Kong dollars. As long as there is net capital inflow to Hong Kong, the HKMA will inject Hong Kong dollars into the local banking system accordingly based on the strong-side convertibility undertaking,'' Tsang wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But he warned of a possible sudden change in market sentiment, amid uncertainties in the global economy and financial markets.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index continued climbing for the fourth consecutive day, gaining 138 points yesterday to 23,787 -- the year's highest point to date - led by Tencent (0700) hitting its record close of HK$215, up 2.2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But Castor Pang Wai-sun, head of research at Core Pacific Yamaichi, said the revision was slow on the uptake. Shares of Chinese internet giant Tencent rose as much as 3 percent yesterday to HK$216.80, reaching a market value of HK$2.03 trillion - breaking through the benchmark of HK$2 trillion for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Automobile shares also saw gains, becoming the best performing sector yesterday. </span><span class="s3">Great Wall Motor</span><span class="s1"> (2333) increased 4.8 percent, becoming the best performing stock in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.Citigroup revised the Hong Kong's benchmark equity index target up to 24,000 in 2017, from 21,500 at present, but said the index has limited room for rally. As only 32 percent of the component stocks have outperformed, it is hard to drive up the rise of the index, Citi said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It said the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect will not spur the rise in capital inflow to SAR stocks, because the increase of liquidity fell below expectations, as the mainland's mutual funds have been allowed to trade through the Shanghai connect since July.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Citi preferred local bank and Macau gaming stocks more than local property developers, saying local banks have abundant capital and better liquidity. For Macau gaming stocks, Citi said revenue growth in the third quarter of this year will accelerate to 8 percent.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The H shares of Chinese firms are now a lot cheaper than their mainland-listed shares, prompting the surge of mainland capital into the local market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">H shares with a large discount to A shares soared yesterday but their A shares generally slid.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Zhejiang Shibao (1057) soared 24 percent to HK$13.32 but its A share fell 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Dongfang Electric (1072) jumped 16 percent but its mainland share dropped 4 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some of the firms saw gains for both A and H shares but the disparity in gains was pronounced.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The H shares of </span><span class="s3">PetroChina</span><span class="s1"> (0857), 40 percent cheaper than the A shares, rose by 6.5 percent while those in the mainland went up 2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some fund companies think mainland stock markets rose too fast earlier, so Chinese across the border want to invest in Hong Kong to avoid potential bubbles back home.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pun Tit-shan, a director at </span><span class="s3">Haitong International</span><span class="s1">, said some foreign hedge funds short-sold Chinese stocks earlier but as the capital is going south, these funds are closing positions in a hurry, making H shares go up fast. He believes H shares, especially those with good results such as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (2318) and other brokerages will climb more.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, Lau Siu-cheung at Prudential Brokerage said H shares with a large premium have risen a lot already. He said if they surge again today, investors should think about selling them.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> earlier enlarged the mechanism for southbound capital so that mutual funds could buy Hong Kong stocks more easily.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Grace Tam Wai-man, market strategist at </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan Asset Management</span><span class="s1">, said the reform was launched earlier than expected. She believes that is because Beijing thinks stock market sentiment is too bullish so the hot money has to flow into the Hong Kong market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">She expects the mainland market will continue to speculate on the price difference between A and H shares in the short term. H shares will go up until prices are similar to those of A shares.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Economies on either side of the border will have to deal with the challenge of hot money inflows for a considerable period, the former mainland banking regulatory head warned.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``The capital inflow is of no surprise, but it is hard to predict the scope of further movement,'' former China Banking Regulatory Commission chairman Liu Mingkang said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``A long-term and dynamic inflow of capital will pose challenges and threats. Governments should be alert to the potential risks.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Excessive capital from overseas quantitative easing measures is drawn to Asia for its steady economic growth , Liu said on the sidelines of the Open University of Hong Kong graduation ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He advised that emerging economies maintain stable economic growth and employment levels to hedge against possible risks. His comments came as the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> yesterday injected a further HK$4.495 billion into the market, after the currency repeatedly hit the strong end of its trading range, or HK$7.75 against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This is the 27th capital injection by the de facto central bank since end-October, taking the total since then to HK$102.15 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam has repeatedly emphasized their unlimited ability to safeguard the trading band between 7.75 and 7.85.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Liu also praised the local government for its ``effective measures'' to control the potential risks in the property market as capital floods in.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hailing the tighter mortgage lending and stamp duty rules, including the new buyers' stamp duty, Liu said that asset prices could have fluctuated if such steps were not taken, leading to a bubble.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Last week, I mentioned that problems from countries like Argentina would not affect China.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Global stock markets also went up after Janet Yellen became US Federal Reserve chair and for the first time at congressional hearings emphasized that the Fed is not eager to raise interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's stock market also continued to rise in the Year of the Horse, with unexpectedly good export data also backing domestic stocks, despite questions being raised about whether the 10.6 percent January export growth, after 4.3 percent in December, was exaggerated.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But at least investors received comfort from the data showing China will likely achieve 7.5 percent growth, dispelling hard-landing fears for now.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Of course, if the higher export data is simply due to more money flowing into China, that would spell some worry for the economy next year as the capital inflow may be seeking a safe haven, coming in from emerging markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The fast inflow could also trigger fluctuations in the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But higher export growth may not necessarily have been caused by cash flows alone. Take a look at European and US economic data. The steady drop in US jobless rates, the rising purchasing managers' index, and consumer confidence index topping market expectations _ all reflect continuing US recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Also, the EU consumer confidence index in December jumped from minus 13.6 percent to minus 11.7 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Overall PMI initial value in Europe rose to 53.2 in January, the highest in 31 months _ reflecting firm recovery.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As these are China's two biggest export markets, the above figures should eliminate worries that mainland export data is full of exaggerations as the export sector is indeed benefiting from the European and US economic recovery.

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Top local financial policymakers said Hong Kong has emerged unscathed from turmoil in the global foreign exchange market caused by the Swiss franc's delinking from the euro. They pledged to keep the Hong Kong dollar peg to the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">``We don't need to _ and won't _ change the currency peg,'' said Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He added that, as a small and open economy and an international financial hub, Hong Kong needs a stable exchange rate, which its currency's linkage to the greenback can guarantee.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chan said there was a short-lived capital inflow into the Hong Kong dollar in search of safety after the Swiss franc surged last Friday, but ``the market calmed down soon.''</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Ceajer Chan Ka-keung echoed support for the US dollar peg. ``The </span><span class="s3">Swiss National Bank</span><span class="s1">'s move revealed huge risks [in the currency market]. But the impact on Hong Kong was limited ... as the markets have great faith in our ability to sustain the currency linkage,'' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Both officials gave their views at the Asian Financial Forum yesterday, which was also attended by Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li. Li said a much-hyped stock exchange link between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is bound to be an upgraded version of the ongoing Shanghai- Hong Kong Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ceajer Chan said launching the Hong Kong- Shenzhen stock link is technically feasible this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> chairman Xiao Gang said at the same forum that the Hong Kong-Shanghai bourse link still has enormous potential but investors on both sides need more time to learn about each other's market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah said the SAR will exempt private-equity funds from capital gains taxes _ an incentive only available to offshore funds.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">More than 50 mainland brokerages could be among the pilot participants in the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">About 70 brokers out of 90 applicants have been approved, but not all of them will be able to launch the H-share trading service for mainlanders when the mutual market scheme is introduced next month, the mainland's Securities Times reported.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The daily trading quota to invest in Shanghai A shares is set at 13 billion yuan (HK$16.39 billion), and there will be a daily cap of 10.5 billion yuan for buying Hong Kong stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some analysts believe the capital inflow to the A-share market will outperform that into the local stock market amid strong demand from overseas investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pegasus Fund manager Paul Pong Po-lam believes the quota for investing in mainland stocks will be mainly used by institutional investors, as the costs are lower than applying for a quota from the QFII scheme. and the Renminbi QFII scheme - the only way overseas investors can tap into the A-shares market at the moment. Retail investors currently account for around 80 percent of the turnover at China's two stock exchanges.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan broke through the 6.3 level and closed at 6.292 against the US dollar in day-time trade yesterday, its highest since August 2015. It has appreciated 3.5 percent last month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts said that US Dollar Index will remain one of the main factors affecting the yuan, but </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> is unlikely to intervene too much, though it does not want the yuan to be too strong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This came when the overnight Hong Kong interbank offered rate surged to 1.18 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index closed at 32,887.27 yesterday, up 279.98 points or 0.86 percent, helped by gains for financial and services firms. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.29 percent to 13,561.65.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares dipped 0.9 percent while the IT sector rose 0.48 percent. The financial sector was 1.32 percent higher and property rose 0.09 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But the mainland property sector fell 1.58 percent. China Evergrande (3333) slumped 7.18 percent to HK$25.85 as it is to sell HK$18 billion worth of convertible bonds. Ulferts International (1711) plummeted more than 20 percent to HK$1.09.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said the HSI might encounter a correction to 31,500 due to sharply increasing derivative transactions. The price to earnings ratio is about 13.6 times in the market, which is the highest since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Retail investors might lose interest as the Lunar New year is around the corner, thus the northern capital inflow would slow down.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Investment value would return when the index goes to 31,500 and the investment bank is still positive about the 37,600 target it set earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">For the month, the HSI was up 9.9 percent, marking the fourth straight month of gains and its best since April 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, accounting firm BDO proposed that companies which have halted trading for 36 months should be delisted, extending from the current 24 months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">BDO reviewed the duration of the suspension in Hong Kong following a proposed reform on delisting procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The review shows that 21 listed issuers were suspended for more than 24 months in 2012 to 2016, of which 11 took more than four years to resume trading of their securities.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">With about US$130 billion (HK$1.014 trillion) of capital inflow to the SAR market since the 2008 credit crunch, the current optimistic expectation of rising asset prices have made investors less alert of potential risks, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shares of </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0005) jumped 3.4 percent to HK$63.40 yesterday, hitting the highest level since last August.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The increase drove up the Hang Seng Index by 79 points, and it closed at 22,675.15, up 169.6 points or 0.75 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Turnover in </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> shares amounted to HK$3.5 billion, accounting for 5.8 percent of the total market turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Since the British voted to leave the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> in June, which hurt the London-based lender badly, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> shares have risen about 36.8 percent, helped by bargain hunting by mainlanders through the Shanghai- Hong Kong Stock Connect right after the Brexit vote, and a global capital relocation to financial firms following Donald Trump's US presidential win.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> yesterday upgraded </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> from "sell" to "buy" with a target price of HK$64 next year, or about 1 percent higher than the current price. It believes </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">'s revenues will turn positive due to potential US rate hikes, which will increase the net interest margin, and better loan growth in the Asia-Pacific region.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The investment bank believes that </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> can maintain a dividend payout ratio of 6.5 percent of net profit, or HK$3.97 per share, as the sale of its Brazil business has improved its financial condition.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In a bullish scenario, where the US increases interest rates at an accelerated pace; the bank could pick up growth in the region, and with mainland investors buying its shares through stock connects, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> could see its shares surge to HK$74.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> cites the risk of a slowdown in trade if Trump adopts a more stringent trade policy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1"> expects the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> to raise interest rates three times next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It also forecast the HSI to touch 25,000 next year, bolstered by new economy industries, yuan depreciation and southbound capital inflow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Only HK$596 million worth of mainland capital flowed to Hong Kong via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong link on the second day of its launch, compared to HK$2.21 billion flowing to the mainland.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A full scale test will be run by the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on its market link with Hong Kong, signalling a countdown to its launch.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But interest among retail investors for the new connect may have already dissipated. The Shenzhen bourse will run a mock test with the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearings (0388) this weekend. Other participating units will take part in another test to be conducted next Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Market watchers, however, are mixed over how investors will react to the launch of the connect.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> (0011) executive director Andrew Fung Hau-chung, believes that only institutional investors are keen on Shenzhen listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But Fung noted 41 fund houses have newly registered during the past two months in Hong Kong, up from 21 in the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Those without official quota to buy A shares are likely to tap the connect, he said. He also believes as the yuan is unlikely to sharply weaken again in a short period of time against the US dollar, mainland investors unlikely to put substantially more money in local stocks through the connect.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The newly added locally -listed mid- cap shares to the connect program are also not very attractive to them, he said. More inflow into Hong Kong through both the Shenzhen and the already existing Shanghai connect will only occur after mainland investors get access to exchange-traded-funds in Hong Kong next year, Fund said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">ETF will give them exposure to global markets. Yuan Ji, chief research officer at Guangzheng Hang Seng, said China's new economies firms are listed in Shenzhen, unlike the large scale state owned enterprises that comprised more than 60 percent of Shanghai listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The favoured unique sectors on the Shenzhen exchange such as white wine, Chinese medicine and IT, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">, however, holds a different view.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Southbound capital flow - money from the mainland - into Hong Kong stock market may increase to 200 billion yuan next year, accounting for as much as 33 percent of turnover in peak period next year, according to Lu Wen-jie, H-share strategist at </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Due to the depreciation of yuan, capital from the mainland will continue to flow out.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Though the stamp duty has been sharply hiked on flats in Hong Kong, other areas such as commercial property stocks will continue attract mainland capital.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Investors from the mainland will become more important for the Hong Kong market than overseas investors as more net capital inflow come from across the border, Lu said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The proportion of turnover in the Hong Kong stock market traded by mainland investors is expected to be as much as 13 percent by the end of this year, which is much higher than 9 percent in 2015 and 5 percent in 2014, Lu said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shanghai for the first time issued yuan-denominated bonds in its free-trade zone (FTZ) on Thursday, a step that could help entice capital inflow as the city renews efforts to push the yuan as an international currency by embracing global investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The move came after nearly three years of lacklustre operations in the free trade zone, which was supposed to be the testing ground for the country's major economic reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The three-year 3 billion-yuan (HK$3.4 billion) local government bonds were sold at a yield of 2.85 per cent and were 2.78 times oversubscribed, said the Finance Ministry in a statement on its website on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It is the first time that overseas banks - </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and DBS - have underwritten local government bonds, the ministry said.It enriches the market participants, enlarges the market scale, increases bond investment products and promotes the issuance of local government bondsWesley Yang, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wesley Yang, head of financial markets, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1"> China, said the issuance marks the start of the FTZ bond market - China's third onshore bond market after the interbank and exchange markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“It is significant to the China bond market development because it enriches the market participants, enlarges the market scale, increases bond investment products and promotes the issuance of local government bonds,” he said. Yang expects more fixed-income products - such as SDR bonds, denominated in the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights currency - to be issued in the zone in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">David Qu, a markets economist at ANZ in Shanghai, said the yield, close to the top end of the bidding range of 2.26 per cent to 3.05 per cent, is largely in line with market expectations, though it is lower than the yield of bonds issued by the Finance Ministry in Hong Kong earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Authorities are mainly targeting building up the yuan bond market on the mainland via the trial in Shanghai FTZ,” he said. “But it's also true that the issuance could help attract capital inflow against the backdrop of growing capital outflow now.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The issuance comes at a time of heightened capital outflows as the yuan plumbs daily lows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing has already launched a series of measures to curb the flow of money from the country, including beefing up checks on outbound deals' authenticity and making it more difficult to lend yuan overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In November, Zhang Xin, head of the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">'s Shanghai branch, told a government conference that the Shanghai free trade zone, the mainland's first Hong Kong-style free market place, would aim to redirect capital flows to achieve a net inflow in 2016, in line with the authorities' goal of stabilising the financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A veteran bonds trader who declined to be named said it is still too early to predict the growth potential of the scheme because of its relatively limited scale.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The bond is part of a combined 114.3 billion yuan in local government bonds sold by the Shanghai municipality this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A mature and established bond market with active participation from global investors is seen as an essential part of Beijing's moves to internationalise the yuan. Mainland companies also tap Hong Kong's dim sum bond market to obtain offshore yuan funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing is gradually opening up its US$8.5 trillion bond market, but interest from abroad appears to be weak because of transparency concerns around the bond issuers and the rule of law.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen and Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme, which celebrates its first anniversary on Tuesday, reported that more international investors traded in Shenzhen stocks than mainland Chinese bought Hong Kong shares during the past year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The volume of Shenzhen shares traded by Hong Kong-based investors, the so-called northbound trade, stood at 875 billion yuan (US$132.24 billion) for the year until Friday, with a net capital inflow of 148.5 billion yuan, according to Hong Kong stock exchange data.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The trade in Hong Kong shares by mainland investors, or southbound trade, stood at HK$475.9 billion (US$60.9 billion), bringing a net capital inflow of HK$111.5 billion into the Hong Kong markets during the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect has been working smoothly since its launch a year ago. It has been a successful scheme to introduce more cross-border trading between Hong Kong and Shenzhen,” said Gary Cheung Wai-kwok, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Who are the winners in mainland-Hong Kong stock connect trading? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2119628/who-are-winners-mainland-hong-kong-stock-connect-trading]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Cheung said southbound trading through the Shenzhen and Hong Kong connect was lower than northbound trading because the Shanghai and Hong Kong connect also allows mainland investors to trade Hong Kong stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The connect between stock exchanges in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, launched on December 5, 2016, followed a link between Hong Kong and Shanghai that was established in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The schemes allow international investors to buy Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks through Hong Kong brokers, while mainland investors can invest in Hong Kong stocks through mainland traders.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We would like to see the connect scheme expand to include more stocks, funds and other products for cross-border trading in future,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Fang Xinghai, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the success of the stock connect had made the A-share market significantly more attractive for overseas investors, and had contributed to the inclusion of A shares in the MSCI benchmark index.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Are too many national holidays dampening the success of Stock Connect? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2028665/are-too-many-national-holidays-dampening-success-stock-connect]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The commission will continue to improve the connect mechanism, provide more risk-management tools for domestic and foreign investors, and further facilitate the internationalisation of capital markets in China, Fang said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect has facilitated global asset allocations for investors in both the mainland and Hong Kong, and improved operational and financial standards at companies listed on the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">,” said Wang Jianjun, the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> president.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The next step for </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is to promote the inclusion of ETFs in schemes, optimise holiday trading arrangements and continuously improve cross-border capital services,” Wang added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive, said the local bourse would continue to work with mainland exchanges and authorities to improve the connect schemes and to add in more products such as exchange-traded funds and bonds to the schemes.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s first rate rise in nearly a decade did not spur local banks to follow suit. But the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> raised its base rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Local best lending rate and savings deposits rate remain unchanged after the benchmark Federal Funds Rate was raised by 25 basis points to 0.50 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Most analysts expect Hong Kong banks to start raising rates within the next six months to a year. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> (0005) and </span><span class="s3">BOC Hong Kong</span><span class="s1"> (2388) said their prime rates would stay at 5 percent, while Standard Chartered Hong Kong will maintain its prime rate at 5.25 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Base rate is the interest the HKMA charges banks to borrow from its discount window.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But local banks rarely borrow from the authority. Instead, they lend among themselves using the HIBOR, or Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, that is also fixed among themselves every morning.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Also, local liquidity as measured by the aggregate balance of local banking system remains ample at about HK$390 billion, ensuring a low HIBOR.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The US rate rise was the first since 2006. Federal Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen said the pace of future rate hikes would be "gradual," with the Fed Fund Rate projected to reach 1.375 percent by the end of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HKMA chief Norman Chan Tak-lam said the US$130 billion of capital inflow to the SAR since 2008 would start to move out, although the pace would not be rapid.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The actual speed of outflows from the HK dollar will depend on the pace of US interest rate hikes and the interest rate differential between the US dollar and HK dollar," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But the market is divided on the pace of future rate hikes amid concerns over the fundamentals of the US economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HSBC Asia-Pacific adviser George Leung Siu-kay said local banks have little incentive to hike rates as there is abundant capital in the SAR, hence low funding costs remain.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The impact on the local economy, with its sluggish prospects, also needs to be taken into consideration, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">DBS Hong Kong managing director for treasury and markets Tommy Ong said that, to trigger an interest rate hike here, it would first require the Hong Kong dollar to weaken to the lower range at HK$7.85 against the greenback as well as intervention by the HKMA to decrease the aggregate balance to a more normal level of about HK$100 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"It might take a year to achieve that as liquidity around the world is still high ,which discourages interest rate spreads," Ong said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar slightly weakened yesterday by 0.03 percent to 7.7524, while overnight HIBOR remains low at 0.043 percent, with the three- month level at 0.39 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As for deposit saving rates, </span><span class="s3">BOCHK</span><span class="s1"> yesterday offered a new promotion of 0.9 percent annualized rate for Hong Kong dollar one-month time deposits of HK$5 million or more.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">DBS Hong Kong also relaunched its H-rate mortgage plan after a four-year halt.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This is expected to be lower than the rate derived from minus the prime rate over the next six months, it said, while the maximum rate can be capped at P-3.1 percent.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The newly-launched Bond Connect will accelerate the pace of reform of China's domestic onshore bond market, which may also open up access for international credit rating agencies, the South China Morning Post has learnt.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It could be “very soon” that Beijing will allow foreign institutions to rate China's onshore bonds, a ground-breaking move that has been sought-after by foreign investors for years, Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">told the Post on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pan made these comments on the sideline of a forum hosted by the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday afternoon to kick off the bond connect scheme - a mechanism that allows foreign investors to trade China's US$9 trillion interbank bond market via Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] (HKEX).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's current rules restrict foreign investment in credit investigations and ratings services. At present, global rating agencies can only have minority stakes in joint-venture operations in China, and they can only grant independent ratings to Chinese firms' overseas entities and debt issuance.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As the rating of bonds by Chinese rating agencies are seen as lenient, international investors have hesitated to rely on them, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The vast majority of bonds in mainland China are rated as triple A by mainland rating agencies. If you ask them why the rating is so high, they explain that it is because these are state-owned giants, with credit underwritten by the government,” said Ding Yuan, vice president and dean of the Shanghai-based China Europe International Business School (CEIBS).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“If foreign investors don't buy into this pricing mechanism, then China will not see the capital inflow it wants, no matter how the authority designs and promotes the new scheme,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/07/03/aec8d4f0-5fcf-11e7-badc-596de3df2027_image_hires_223607.jpg]In mid May, China announced that it would open its market to US credit rating agencies, in addition to credit card companies and imports of US beef, with no specific time table.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It was an “early harvest” from the 100-day plan made by China and US to reset the trade relationship since president Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump met in April.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The first day trading has seen 7 billion yuan worth of bonds traded by 89 financial firms via the scheme, which allows international investors to trade mainland bonds via the platforms of HKEX and China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The settlement is handled by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> and relevant mainland parties.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shen Hua, chief executive of BOCHK Asset Management, a unit of Bank of China Hong Kong, said the first day trading amount exceeded 10 per cent of the daily trading volume of the onshore market that usually hovers at about 60 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“It reflects that the Bond Connect scheme is well-received, and we expect that it will grow significantly soon,” Shen said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“In addition, as the yuan has already become one of the reserve currencies of the SDR basket, there is an increasing interest in investing in the Chinese onshore bond market,” Shen said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/07/03/af0a76da-5fcf-11e7-badc-596de3df2027_image_hires_223607.jpg]“This is a good start and is in line with market expectation,” said Jasper Lo Cho-yan, the chief strategist at King International Financial Holdings.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lo said turnover via the new connect scheme would increase to US$250 billion in the next two years as predicted by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The rising value of the yuan would attract international investors to trade mainland bonds,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lo, however, believes that the southbound trading would only be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaoja said the local bourse would introduce southbound trading when there is a market demand for it.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As of 31 December 2016, the outstanding value of the onshore bond market was US$8.1 trillion, making it the world's third-largest. But international investors now hold only 1.3 per cent of the total.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the midpoint rate of the yuan at 6.3729 against the dollar on Monday, stronger by 56 basis points from the previous trading day's mid-price at 6.3785 and analysts expect the Chinese currency to consolidate given a number of holidays this week.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to buy or sell the currency at a level 2 per cent above or below the midpoint rate on a daily basis. The onshore yuan closed last Friday at 6.3823 to the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan stronger 0.09 per cent, or 56 basis points, to 6.3689 as of 10:30 am in the spot market, while the offshore yuan strengthened 0.07 per cent, or 43 basis points, to 6.3932 as of 10:30 am.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The Chinese yuan appears locked in near term consolidation around 6.35 to 6.40 to the US dollar. President Xi Jinping has ended his US state visit by reiterating on several occasions that China has no intention to depreciate the CNY further," Heng Koon-how, a senior currency strategist with </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"In addition, various measures by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> to limit speculative sale of the CNY is likely to stabilise (the) spot rate. Furthermore, trading activity is likely to quiet down as we head into the National Day Golden Week, starting from 1 October," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's markets will be shut from October 1 to 7 for national holidays on the founding of the People's Republic. Trading will resume on October 8.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Heng said fundamentals were still firmly negative against most Emerging Markets and Asian currencies, but the pace of depreciation was likely to moderate due to improving valuations. Most Asian currencies remain held hostage by export contraction, growth slowdown and the dovish </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> which stood pat by not raising US interest rates this months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Our expectation of the start of Fed rate hike has been delayed to December.

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar traded in the morning at 7.7502, weakened slightly from 7.7505 against the greenback, as the capital inflow slowed down but still close to the upper side of the peg.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market is on course to beat its mainland counterpart by the largest margin in five years as Beijing's regulatory crackdown aimed at cleaning up the financial industry drives a tide of southbound investment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As mainland investors flee yuan-denominated equities amid heightened regulatory surveillance, they have been loading up on less pricey Hong Kong shares as an alternative, through the stock connect programmes that enable cross-border trading.We are optimistic about the Hong Kong market. H shares will continue to benefit from southbound investment from the mainland and global capital inflowCheng Yu, fund manager, HSBC Jintrust</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Boosted by the flow of capital from Chinese and overseas investors, the Hang Seng Index's gain so far this year against the mainland's stock benchmark is set to be the widest since 2012. Investors including HSBC Jintrust Fund Management say the outperformance is likely to persist throughout 2017, because of the valuation advantage and under-allocation by global investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“H shares will still hold the edge against A shares in the following half year,” said Cheng Yu, a fund manager with the Shanghai-based firm, who invests in the Hong Kong market via the exchange links. “We are relatively optimistic about the Hong Kong market. H shares will continue to benefit from the southbound investment from the mainland and global capital inflow.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index has gained 14 per cent in 2017, while the Shanghai Composite has reversed earlier gains to retreat 1.4 per cent. Even as Hong Kong shares advance in value, they are still 15 per cent cheaper than the mainland equities, according to a gauge tracking the price gap between the two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Among some large dual-listed companies, </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s Shanghai-listed shares are 9 per cent more expensive than its Hong Kong listing, and </span><span class="s3">Air China</span><span class="s1">'s Shanghai tranche trades at a 49 per cent price premium.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The performances of the two markets have diverged more since April after top policy makers introduced a raft of measures to clean up the financial sector. In a Politburo meeting, President Xi Jinping even elevated financial stability to the level of state security, calling for more cross-market regulatory co-ordination. The state news agency </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> then ran at least seven articles voicing support for Xi's view.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The relevant regulators were quick to act. The central bank has refrained from injecting more funds into the financial system to cut commercial lenders' leverage, the securities regulator pledged to be tougher on manipulation and the body overseeing the banking sector has clamped down on wealth management products that illegally invest in stocks and bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The campaign has caused a liquidity squeeze in the capital markets, sending the Shanghai Composite plummeting from this year's high on April 11, and the yield on 10-year government bonds to an almost two-year high.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As the Chinese government continues to tighten restrictions on the yuan's free convertibility, the Hong Kong stock market has become a major avenue for mainland investors seeking havens for their assets, thanks to the two stock link schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland investors have bought more Hong Kong shares than they have sold through the southbound investment channels every month since at least 2016, according to the exchanges' data. As a result, their pricing power has been growing in the Hong Kong market. Trading through southbound investment now makes up 12 per cent of stock turnover in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The correction in A shares is actually driving Chinese investors into Hong Kong's market and boosting southbound flows,” said Kingston Lin, chief executive officer of Ox Financial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong shares will remain in favour with overseas investors even though they now have easier access to yuan-denominated stocks trading in the mainland, according to HSBC Jintrust's Cheng.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Global investors have qualms about the system of the domestic market, such as the rules on trading suspension and foreign exchanges,” he said. “So they are more inclined to invest in the offshore market.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks accounted for 62 per cent of Cheng's US$134 million fund by the end of the first quarter, with </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">New China Life Insurance</span><span class="s1"> among the top holdings.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland stocks are actually more expensive than they initially look, according to many observers, as the bubble of small-caps has yet to burst. Though the average price-to-earnings ratio of all 3,175 companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses is about 35 times, more than two thirds of them trade above 50 times, according to Li Xunlei, chief economist at Zhongtai Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index traded around a 21-month high, while the Shanghai Composite struggled at an almost seven-month low at 3,061.50 points on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong continues to show value for portfolio allocation,” said Hong Hao, head of research at </span><span class="s3">Bocom International Holdings</span><span class="s1">, the Hong Kong brokerage unit of Bank of Communications. “For Shanghai, the index will be trading below 3,300 for two thirds of the time throughout the year.”</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's housing market will remain buoyant despite the sky-high prices and continue to attract capital inflow and enjoy strong local demand, say two of the city's top property developers, after reporting better earnings on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The city's leading developer, </span><span class="s3">Henderson Land Development</span><span class="s1">, said in its financial results filing that economic policy uncertainties in the US and the UK will encourage more capital into Hong Kong and support the property market growth.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Persistent liquidity is set to flow into the territory on the back of its position as a comprehensive international financial centre and its relatively stable currency, ” said Henderson company secretary Timon Liu.Persistent liquidity is set to flow into the territory on the back of its position as a comprehensive international financial centre and its relatively stable currencyTimon Liu, Henderson Land company secretary</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The property giant posted a better-than-expected underlying profit growth last year, rising 29 per cent to HK$14.2 billion (US1.83 billion), thanks to a sales rebound in mainland China and disposal of some non-core investment properties.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Revenue from home sales in Hong Kong and the mainland rose 13 per cent to HK$17.7 billion, while rental income from offices and malls dropped 1 per cent to HK$5.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It announced a final dividend of HK$1.13 per share, making the total dividend for the fiscal year 2016 to HK$1.55 per share, rising from HK$1.45 in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shares in the developer ended up 1.3 per cent to HK$47.5 before the results were revealed on Tuesday evening. The family-owned builder, controlled by 89-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Lee Shau-Kee, has interests spanning hotels, retail and utilities such as </span><span class="s3">Towngas</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Ferry</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Its property sales, combining residential units and disposal of industrial and commercial space in 2016 amounted to HK$14.9 billion, compared with HK$11.5 billion in 2015. Its key sites are the “Double Cove Summit” development in Ma On Shan, and “Wellesley” in Mid-Levels and “Seven Victory Avenue” in Ho Man Tin. Seven Victory Avenue is known for providing super-tiny flats as small as 161 square feet.Hong Kong's property market has seen a roller coster year in 2016. Although the government rolled out new cooling measures for the sector, strong demand from home buyers has supported the sector to maintain stable growthLui Che-woo, chairman, </span><span class="s3">K Wah International</span><span class="s1"> Holdings</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The company plans to launch another four residential projects within the year, it said, and has a total of about 2,600 residential units available for sale in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It also expects HK$7 billion of income generated from disposals to be booked this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Low interest rates, smaller units rolled out by developers, as well as strong interest among mainland Chinese property investors have propelled the property market despite a raft of cooling measures, which includes an expansion of stamp duties for property transactions for the first time in three years in November.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong's property market has seen a roller coster year in 2016,” Lui Che-woo, chairman of </span><span class="s3">K Wah International</span><span class="s1"> Holdings and a property-to-gambling magnate, said at its annual result briefing on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Although the government rolled out new cooling measures for the sector, strong demand from home buyers has supported the sector to maintain stable growth.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mid-sized homebuilder reported that 2016 full-year underlying profit, excluding fair value changes, jumped 113 per cent to HK$2.8 billion (US$360.53 million), lifted by robust property sales in Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The company's managing director Lui Yiu Wah added now the market mainly sees owner-occupied type homebuyers rather than property investors as the government's cooling measures have helped to keep some property speculators away.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The developer said it was planning to offer additional housing units in 2017, as it has been buying new land at record prices both in Hong Kong and mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">K Wah beat 15 mainland and Hong Kong developers in December by paying HK$5.9 billion for a residential site at the Kai Tak area in eastern Kowloon.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The overall residential market price, however, seems unaffected and remains on the upward trend commenced in March 2016,” the company said in the filing.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts say the latest US interest rate rise is an obvious warning sign to Hong Kong's property market.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In a city where property is king, HK$7 million won't get you the castle. But head overseas and that amount of money could deliver some royal returns.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Italy, for example, you could be rubbing shoulders with Hollywood royalty in a three-bedroom waterfront villa on Lake Como, on which George Clooney's £25million (HK$299 million) mansion also sits.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Or if the bustle of the big city is more to your taste, you could nab a cosy one-bedroom flat in London's Notting Hill, a stone's throw from Kensington Palace Gardens, one of the world's most expensive streets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">If the balmy climes of Southeast Asia are more to your taste, take a look at a four-bedroom resort-style home in Phuket, Thailand, where the 30 million baht (HK$7.2 million) price tag?includes membership in an exclusive golf club.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Closer to home, you could secure a three-bedroom place in Shanghai's Pudong financial district for the same money.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The HK$7 million price tag is significant because it is the price below which buyers must come up with a bigger down payment under new rules announced on Friday to cool the market.DON'T MISS:?Can't afford a home in Hong Kong? Then don't buy one, says Financial Secretary John Tsang</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The measures, introduced by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, mean buyers must find 40 per cent of the purchase price before getting a mortgage, taking the dream of home ownership even further away for many. There are also new affordability restrictions on loans to buyers of second homes.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The measures are the seventh step introduced to cool the market since February 2013, and also include higher taxes on sales.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Agents say they expect the latest measures to cut the number of sales and lead to a dip in prices, though industry analysts question their long-term effectiveness given the tight supply and limited space for development.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"When comparing to the property prices in London, Hong Kong is higher but still similar in general. Both are a free market for external capital inflow and outflow," said Pantazis Therianos, managing partner of London-based property developer Euroterra Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"In terms of central London, HK$7 million is not much as well, but in other European countries, it can buy a house in Greece or Bulgaria," Therianos said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, however, it won't even cover a 296 sq ft flat in Sheung Wan. The asking price for one such home in Old Bailey Street is HK$8 million, according to the website squarefoot.com.hk But for those willing to commute, full village houses in Sai Kung, covering up to 2,100 sq ft, are available for less then HK$7 million on the same website.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's third-quarter economic data on Wednesday might paint a picture of stable growth in the world's second biggest economy, but the figures will not dissuade investors from worrying about the indebted country's future, economists warn.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Immediate risks of an hard landing have abated thanks to government-backed spending, but Beijing's structural problems of excessive capacity, ballooning debts and the absence of new growth engines are worsening, making it harder for the Chinese leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping, to manage.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Positive signs as China's prolonged industrial deflation finally ends after demand grows for coal, steel[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2028047/chinas-prolonged-industrial-deflation-finally-ends-demand-grows]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Despite a headline growth rate above 6.5 per cent, investors are finding few areas to place their money. Instead they have rushed to buy properties in big cities, or simply remitted funds abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"I am not worried about a short-term headline GDP [gross domestic product] figure as the current momentum of a firmer footing of economic growth may not fade immediately," said Zhao Hao, an economist at Commerzbank in Singapore. "Yet, for the long-term, China still lacks new growth propellers."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's state statistics agency is scheduled to release a flurry of economic data on Wednesday, including the third-quarter GDP as well as investment, retail, and industrial production for September.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A Reuters poll of 59 economists showed on Monday that they expected the GDP to grow 6.7 per cent in the third quarter - unchanged from the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's Premier Li Keqiang said last week that China's third-quarter economic performance was better than expected, having met the annual job creation target in the first nine months already.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Li Keqiang hails third-quarter performance as China economy steps out of slump[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2027033/li-keqiang-hails-third-quarter-performance-china-economy-steps]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the same time, worries about China's debt, the yuan and the housing market persist.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In a move to curb excessive property price gains in major cities, China's top leadership had urged more than 20 cities to launch rules restricting home purchases, and the campaign, in turn, was expected to slow down growth in future, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The forthcoming housing downturn and the lack of alternative growth engines is one major reason that we have had our China GDP growth forecast of 6 per cent for 2017, slowing down from 6.6 per cent expected for 2016," said Yao Wei, chief China economist at </span><span class="s3">Societe Generale</span><span class="s1">.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the long run it would take time for China to shift its growth to services and new technologies, instead of state-led capital spending, and "economic growth will just have to be slower" in the process, Yao said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, China's yuan has weakened to its lowest level against the dollar in six years as China's foreign exchange reserves - a rough measure of the capital inflow and outflow gap - has been shrinking quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Deflationary pressures to continue ‘haunting China's economy' this year: economists[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1899664/deflationary-pressures-continue-haunting-chinas-economy-year]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Nathan Chow, an economist at DBS, said there were more fundamental challenges, including the mounting debt and struggling manufacturing businesses, for Chinese leaders to look after beyond quarterly growth numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"For the long-term, downward pressure remains," Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While Beijing had been pledging to boost consumer power, China's household consumption had still not taken a lead in shoring up the economy, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> data, published on Tuesday, showed that banks in China granted more credit in September than in August or July.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Calculations by the South China Morning Post showed that mortgage loans' share of total bank credit dropped to 47 per cent in September - down from 71 per cent in August and a stunning 90 per cent in July - reflecting banks' caution about excessive lending to home buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts said the focus of policy was shifting from growth to credit risks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Broader worries about credit risks means further monetary easing is unlikely," Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Other September data has shown a conflicting picture as exports were surprisingly weak while factory gate prices surprised markets on the uptick side by ending a 54-month industrial deflation and indicated improving industrial profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yet economists are tending to expect that third-quarter GDP growth will be mainly within this year's official target of 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It is the first time that a range has been given as policymakers seemingly showed more tolerance for a slower growth.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan seems to have stalled in its internationalisation, as overseas investors are reluctant to increase yuan holdings amid concerns of capital controls and currency interventions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, analysts still expect China to stick to its yuan i internationalisation plan and gradually open up the onshore asset market, as the country looks likely to uphold a free trade policy even as protectionist forces are on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Global foreign exchange reserves held in yuanreached 1.1 per cent[http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/03/31/pr17108-IMF-Releases-Data-on-the-Currency-Composition-of-Foreign-Exchange-Reserves] of total reserves by the end of 2016, way behind its major currency peers, according to a report by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> last week.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Indeed, its [the yuan's] 1.1 per cent share was more or less the same with the preliminary survey in 2015, indicating mild inflow into yuan assets as a reserve asset after the admission of the yuan into the Special Drawing Right basket,” said Ken Cheung, Asian forex strategist for </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A previous ad-hoc survey by the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> showed[https://www.google.com.hk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6wsDxh4jTAhUGNpQKHVsgAF4QFggYMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imf.org%2Fen%2F~%2Fmedia%2FAF651C1D464A4E21AA94A971A6214818.ashx&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgx5VtpcbQpDiFZDQiA9oANGZ_Vw&amp;sig2=BOhPLaszYoqdecLiOk69PA] 130 countries had held a total of US$74 billion worth of yuan assets by the end of 2014, 1.1 per cent of their total official foreign assets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The current yuan share is significantly lower than its 10.92 per cent share in the SDR basket and near 13 per cent share in global trade in 2015, Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It's also way behind its peers. As the latest </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> report showed, US dollar assets represented 64 per cent of global forex reserves by the end of 2016, while the euro accounted for 19.7 per cent, the British pound 4.4 per cent, and the Japanese yen 4.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, the latest result is “hardly surprising”, given that China has faced substantial capital outflow pressure since its exchange rate reform in August 2015, Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Currently, China's tight capital control measures remain an important concern for international investors who conduct onshore yuan investment, as they worry about the difficulties in repatriating the capital from within the country.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This explains the [policymakers'] failure to improve the yuan function of investment and reserves despite the official yuan inclusion in the SDR basket last year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Steven Innes, a senior trader at Oanda Asia Pacific, also said China's previous attempts to curb the yuan's depreciation had caused a funding squeeze in offshore yuan markets and is likely viewed as a “blight” toward China's ultimate goal for yuan internationalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“All too frequent interventions will sour international investor sentiment,” he said, adding that tightening capital controls have also kept investors away from conducting business in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, Cheung still expect China to stick with its internationalisation plan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“With rising protectionism, China seeks to uphold globalisation and the free-trade policy, and in doing so, China could play a larger role on international affairs,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy for </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, said that as the summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump nears, trade tensions are going to be a key focus.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Last month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in the annual government work report that authorities will “maintain the RMB's stable position in the global economy system” in 2017. That marked a change in the language he used to describe the yuan in the previous years, when he pledged to “keep the yuan stable at an appropriate and balanced level”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The subtle change has sparked speculation that policymakers may be willing to embrace more yuan volatility in 2017 in order to facilitate the goal of currency internationalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yi Gang, Deputy Governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, also stressed in a statement this week that yuan internationalisation is a medium-to-long term strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Indeed, the latest </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s statement echoed the comment that ‘maintaining the RMB position in the global monetary system' in the Government Work Report,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“In this circumstance, we expect that China will manage to keep the yuan stable in the near term and consider easing its capital outflow control measures later this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's policymakers have already tried to attract capital inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Premier Li said in his annual work report last month that policymakers will allow overseas funds to buy onshore bonds in Hong Kong in 2017 through a Bond Connect scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Details on the mechanics, including implementation time frame, were not immediately available, but the general thrust is consistent with other measures to boost market accessibility and encourage inflows,” said Chandler.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts expect China to open up the onshore asset market gradually and the yuan to depreciate at a modest pace in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We remain of the view that the offshore yuan will undergo a modest depreciation this year, and the potential capital inflow would support the offshore yuan further when investors start to recognise the functions of investment and reserves in yuan assets in the longer term,” Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing's latest financial industry reform allowing some mainland residents to directly invest abroad through a pilot programme signals good news for Hong Kong's stock and property markets but may also bring new challenges for Leung Chun-ying, the city's next chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The milestone plan announced last week allows local residents in the small but wealthy city of Wenzhou in the east to make direct investments abroad - an effort that is also seen helping the country ease growing pressure to manage its more than US$3 trillion foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing did not mention any specific destination in the announcement for such investments from Wenzhou, but analysts say Hong Kong, rather than New York or London, will become rich mainlanders' first choice for investments under the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The property market in Hong Kong is likely to be the first to benefit because it is already a market that mainlanders are very familiar with and it is also very close to the mainland geographically," said Hu Yifan, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">Haitong International Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"If you look back into the past decades, you will find Wenzhou people are interested in investing in two things - property and mining - and they like speculation in the markets," Hu said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wenzhou is considered the birthplace of the mainland's private economy. Many Wenzhou businessmen are well known for their international trade and export all kinds of products - from sofas to soap - to places like Italy and Iraq. They made money initially from exports and then aggressively invested their wealth in properties. But the inflow of funds could exacerbate Hong Kong people's complaints about high property prices in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Newly elected chief executive Leung pledged to his supporters that he would help cool off a potential asset bubble and create more affordable apartments for local residents.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the benchmark Hang Seng Index has recovered slowly from the 2008 global financial crisis. Some investors and government officials have been concerned about a possible capital outflow of the stock market amid economic slowdown on the mainland and the worsening debt crisis in Europe, with a negative impact on Hong Kong's export business.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Liu Ligang, chief economist for Greater China at Australian bank ANZ, believed the new investment rules for Wenzhou residents would bring in fresh capital inflow in both the equity and housing markets in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Currently, Wenzhou holds US$56 billion in bank deposits and about US$190 billion in housing stock, according to Liu's research.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"If just 5 per cent of these holdings flow to the Hong Kong market, it will deliver a significant boost to Hong Kong's equity and housing market," said Liu.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The new investment rules for Wenzhou could be expanded nationwide if the pilot programme can make a smooth start, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Tianjin, two of the mainland's richest cities, have also lobbied the central government for similar policy support.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">An influx of hot money into Hong Kong chasing the rising yuan has forced the city's financial chiefs to exchange HK$32.24 billion worth of local currency for US dollars in the past two weeks as they try to stop the Hong Kong dollar from spilling over its official limit of HK$7.75 against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ten times this past fortnight, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has intervened to weaken the local currency. The last time it took such action was in 2009, and many analysts believe the main reason this time round is the same - quantitative easing by the US, a controversial policy designed to put money back into its own economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But this time, analysts expect a longer lasting inflow of hot money - so named for its speculative nature which means it tends to come in quickly and leave just as quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">For Hong Kong, protecting the peg is not an option. It was introduced in 1983 to ensure a fixed exchange rate against the US dollar, which means the HKMA must buy or sell in the market to keep the local unit trading within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The monetary authority's last intervention came as HK$640 billion of capital poured into the city between October 2008 and the end of 2009. The influx came in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's first round of quantitative easing measures and was widely attributed to this controversial monetary policy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Then, the Fed spent about US$1.7 trillion of newly created cash buying bonds back from US banks. By "printing money", it kept interest rates low to help homeowners and cash-strapped businesses, while the spare cash at the banks was intended to stimulate the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But it also meant investment banks and financial firms ended up with more cash to invest in healthier overseas markets with higher rates of interest, such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, chief executive of Cathay Conning Asset Management, blamed the latest hot money inflows on the Fed's September announcement of a third round of quantitative easing, called QE3. The Fed will buy US$40 billion of mortgage debt each month without a specified end date. The Fed would also hold the benchmark interest rate close to zero until at least mid-2015.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In addition, the week before QE3 was announced, the </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1"> unveiled an unlimited bond-purchase programme and vowed to keep interest rates low. The </span><span class="s3">Bank of Japan</span><span class="s1"> also joined in, expanding its asset-purchase fund by 10 trillion yen (HK$969 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"All of this monetary stimulus has been causing some investors to move money back to the region," Konyn said. "Central banks are cautious about the effects of hot money," he said, adding that it could prove positive for asset prices in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"However, these distortions will impact domestic consumption, causing economies to consume less of their own manufactures in favour of exports," he said. "Ultimately, it will cause central banks to raise interest rates."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Stephen Sheung, an investment strategist at SHK Private, expects the latest round of hot money inflows to Hong Kong to last a long time but at lower levels than those in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We should note that the QE3 is open-ended: the US Federal Reserve has not said when it will end. This means the inflows to Hong Kong are also open-ended," Sheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said the rising yuan and figures showing signs of economic recovery on the mainland was boosting inflows as overseas money bet on the yuan-denominated investment products available in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Andrew Fung Hau-chung, executive director of Hang Seng bank, said the capital inflow this time started with an apparent asset re-allocation by some traditional funds that increased the weight of Hong Kong or mainland shares in their global portfolios.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The investment policy of this sort of fund is relatively long term. Thus, I am not sure this can be dubbed hot money," Fung said. "Of course, there can be more speculative flows after evidence of these inflows, to jump on the wagon. The increase in stock market volume has not been big enough to define the inflows as big. There is no apparent sign the inflows are being invested in property."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage, said the hot money inflows may have come from Japan, with investors shifting some mainland assets to Hong Kong as tensions increase between Beijing and Tokyo over the disputed islands in the East China Sea.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China is planning more bond market infrastructure improvement beyond the mainland-Hong Kong trading connect scheme, the head of China's foreign exchange regulator said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pan Gongsheng, head of the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, told the China Financial Forum on Friday that Beijing is mulling more “infrastructure connectivity” improvements to attract more foreign investors into the onshore bond market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">These measures would be in addition to the bond connect scheme pledged by Premier Li Keqiang earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“China will steadily push forward the connectivity of China's financial market infrastructure and cross-border cooperation. The bond connect scheme is just one of them. We'll offer more,” said Pan, without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pan said China will enhance the relevant legal, accounting, auditing, taxation and credit rating policies, and will also expand tools for hedging risk.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">His words were echoed by Xu Zhen, chairman of Shanghai Clearing House, which oversees a major part of China's interbank bond market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Xu told the </span><span class="s3">Xinhua News Agency</span><span class="s1"> on Saturday that the clearing house would cooperate with the City of London, London Clearing House, the </span><span class="s3">CME</span><span class="s1"> Clearing Europe, and </span><span class="s3">Clearstream</span><span class="s1"> under </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Börse AG</span><span class="s1">, in a bid to strengthen the “connectivity of financial market infrastructure”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Xu said the Shanghai Clearing House should prepare to align with these institutions' standards before the “relevant policies land”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said the bond market should be the first step in internationalising the renminbi, before the equity markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of February, China announced that it would give overseas investors access to its foreign-exchange derivatives market to allow hedging of bond positions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> opened the country's 58.2 trillion yuan interbank market to foreign institutional investors last year to attract long-term inflows amid a weakening currency and a flight of capital. Unlike other programmes that allow foreign capital inflow, this has no quota limitation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Overseas investors held 852.6 billion yuan (US$124 billion) of onshore bonds at the end of last year, or 1.5 per cent of the market, which is the world's third largest. The holdings fell by 3.5 billion yuan in February to 749.4 billion yuan, after a 25.9 billion yuan fall in January.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pan also disclosed that more special drawing rights-denominated bonds are in the pipeline after the first was issued in September by the </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> and the second by </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> in October.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Top of the agenda for China's financial regulator in 2017 is to deflate various economic bubbles without crushing them.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The steepest yuan depreciation in more than two decades, runaway house prices, booming bad loans, and a sudden bond market rout by at the end of last year suggested financial risks surged in China in 2016, after years of easy credit.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As the US enters an interest rate-rise cycle, and while China is still struggling to fix an economic structure still heavily relying on investment while facing downward pressure on maintaining its GDP target, the top priority for China's policy makers in 2017 is to curb those bubbles, while at the same time avoid triggering any other major systematic turbulence -and that's going to be tough ask, say analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"It is crystal clear that those bubbles cannot be inflated any more, but they cannot be allowed to burst either," said Hong Hao, chief strategist with Bocom.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The central government's balancing act is becoming more and more difficult, as it has to monitor too many more things: the currency, housing, and the bond and stock markets… any stumble could trigger a vicious downward spiral," he said.The central government's balancing act is becoming more and more difficult, as it has to monitor too many more things: the currency, housing, and the bond and stock markets… any stumble could trigger a vicious downward spiralHong Hao, chief strategist, Bocom</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Early signs of the jitters have already started to appear in China's US$9 bond market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The sudden bond sell-off at the end of last year triggered a chain reaction among brokerage firms, funds and banks, as panicky investors - both individual and institutional - rushed to cash out their investments packaged up as bond-related wealth or asset management products.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Bond prices first started falling in November, as the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">decided to steer money-market rates higher to encourage deleveraging, and to cushion the falling yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Those falls then morphed into a record sell-off of government bonds in early December, as well as an intensive wave of defaults by corporate bonds, as bearish sentiment deepened after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, pushing up expectations of a more hawkish approach to interest rates.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong thinks the central bank actually meant just to squeeze liquidity to force out risky investments based on high leverage - but that caused bigger-than-expected volatilities, forcing it to inject further liquidity into the market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">More than 165 billion yuan and 90 billion yuan were poured in on December 20 and 21 respectively, via open market operations - the buying and selling of government securities in the open market in order to expand or contract the amount of money in the banking system - before bond futures rebounded, stabilising the debt market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The bond market is still only temporarily stabilised for now using big fresh liquidity injections. But further volatility may return again this year," he said, adding with the Fed raising interest rates and Trump introducing more economic stimulus policies after assuming the presidency, bonds may again drop sharply.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Li Yimin, a senior analyst with Shenwan Hong yuan Securities says the key dilemma facing the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is on the one hand it is under pressure from the decision makers to squeeze out dangerous leverage in the economy, while on the other prevent "any over tightening of liquidity that might trigger systemic volatily".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That situation has deteriorated over the past few years, with the flood of easy credit effectively fuelling the runaway growth of the financial sector.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The latest economic data shows China's real economy is plagued with industrial oversupply, while new economy growth is not fast enough to make up for older economy industrial losses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But as China's finance sector continues growing, so does the risk of bursting bubbles.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The added value contribution to GDP by the financial sector had surged to 9.2 per cent by June, up from 5 per cent in 2007, dwarfing the US (7 per cent), and Japan (5 per cent), the official Chinese Securities Times reported in August.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Debt carried by non-financial corporates has already surpassed 130 per cent of GDP, ranking China high among major economies, according to leading government think-tank, the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Non-performing loans (NPLs) among Chinese banks accounted for 1.76 per cent of gross loans at the end of September, up from 1.67 per cent at the end of last year and 1.25 per cent at the end of 2014, </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> reported in December.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Another major challenge, meanwhile, is to clearly define the powers and responsibilities of the different authorities overseeing the different markets, said Liu Shenjun, deputy director of the CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance in Shanghai.Some authorities will be unwilling to relinquish their existing powers, while others will be eyeing more. Separate industry players involved will be lobbying purely for their own interestsLiu Shenjun, deputy director, CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Obviously China's financial regulatory framework is crying out for reform, but that's being stymied, mainly due to the complicated network of interested groups involved," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Some authorities will be unwilling to relinquish their existing powers, while others will be eyeing more. Separate industry players involved will be lobbying purely for their own interests," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Criticisms against the current regulatory framework started swirling in the summer of 2015, when a bull run abruptly ended on the Chinese stock market, wiping trillions of yuan in value from the market in two days.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The securities regulator was caught flat footed, and was heavily criticised for not finding and then handling the huge leveraged capital inflow into the shadow banking sector quickly enough.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Last year, again, fresh turmoil swept listed companies as deep-pocketed insurers began snapping up shares - including in the country's then-biggest property developer </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1"> - in an effort to improve their earnings, by making short-term stock investment gains.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Once again, the regulators were caught short, and criticised for their slowness in stepping in to curb the practice.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">President Xi Jinping, as early as October 2015, raised the issue that the "existing regulatory framework does not fit the development of China's financial industry", and urged reform to prevent systemic risk growing, during a meeting with senior party members.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Regular discussions have since been held on how the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> can work more effectively with the three main bodies overseeing the securities, insurance and banking markets, and how their structures could be reshuffled to allow better information sharing and coordination.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But according to experts little concrete progress was made on either front last year, meaning the pressure is well and truly on, to get their heads together and follow Xi's lead in creating not only a more efficient framework, but more effective mechanisms, should further financial crises emerge.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Homeowners in Hong Kong were bracing themselves for higher mortgage repayments as a string of the city's biggest banks raised their lending rates on Thursday for the first time in more than decade.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The move by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> followed an increase by Hong Kong's de facto central bank in its base lending rate in lockstep with an overnight move by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">. The change formally brings to an end 12 years of unchanged lending rates in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The base lending rate was raised by 25 basis points to 2.5 per cent, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said on its website, effective immediately. It paved the way for the city's commercial banks to start raising their so-called prime rates, hitting homeowners in the pocket.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This will put an end to an era of extremely cheap lending and is set to bring volatility to the investment and property markets. It would be unrealistic to expect property prices to only go up,” said the de facto central bank's chief executive officer Norman Chan Tak-lam at a media briefing in Hong Kong early on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The public will need to be aware of the risks related to asset-price changes caused by the interest rate rise.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The base lending rate is the interest the HKMA charges commercial banks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The latest move by the Fed - the third in 2018, and the eighth since the end of so-called quantitative easing in December 2015 - had an immediate impact in Hong Kong, as some of the city's biggest lenders announced they were raising their prime rates.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That will translate to higher mortgage payments for loans that are tied to the prime rate.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> was the first to do so on Thursday morning, increasing its best lending rate by 12.5 basis points to 5.125 per cent, from 5 per cent, effective September 28.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HSBC raises Hong Kong prime rate for the first time in a decade[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2165920/hsbc-raises-hong-kong-prime-rate-first-time-decade-ending]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> said they would increase their best lending rates by the same amount, to 5.375 per cent and 5.125 per cent respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's monetary policy is tied to the US to maintain the local currency's peg at HK$7.80 per US dollar. That means every move by the US Fed - one of the most publicised economic events on Earth - is mirrored in equal measure in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The US central bank raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point overnight, and affirmed its outlook for further increases well into 2019[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2165891/us-federal-reserve-raises-rates-and-says-more-coming-brushing-trump].</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chan said different banks would decide when and how much to increase their prime lending rate.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The rate rise will bring in uncertainties to Hong Kong,” he said, pointing to the property market. He added that other uncertainties include whether the US-China trade war will worsen and whether the US will speed up the pace of its increases in interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The US [Fed] had expected to increase interest rate one more time this year and three more times next year. The Fed rate would go up to around 3 per cent while Hong Kong would follow suit. This is not excessive, but it is just to bring the interest rate from an extremely low level to a normal level. The Hong Kong economy and banking sector could cope with such movement,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chan said since April, there has been about a HK$100 billion capital outflow from Hong Kong, representing only about 10 per cent of the HK$1 trillion capital inflow since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The banking sector is still full of liquidity. The banks hold a combined HK$1 trillion Exchange Fund notes while the aggregated balance has over HK$70 billion. The liquidity means banks have no need to rush to increase the interest rate substantially.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The US also plans to increase its interest rate gradually. The market may have volatilities during this process, but the economy should be able to cope with the rate rise. The normalisation of interest rates would allow the [Hong Kong] economy to grow in a more healthy manner,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a city lawmaker and stockbroker warned that the property market should brace itself.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The property market will have to prepare for a slowdown as the higher rate will add to homebuyers' mortgage payments,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There are two types of mortgage loans in Hong Kong: those tied to the prime rate, or those tied to the interbank offered rate (Hibor).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The cost of money in the city soared to a 10-year high on Thursday as it became harder for banks to obtain funds. The one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor), a measure of how much banks charge each other for short-term loans, added 6 basis points to 2.27 per cent, its highest level since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">For prime-linked loans, the rate has remained between 5 per cent and 5.25 per cent, even while most commercial banks have already started to increase their rate for large deposit sums, as well as raise the payment for new borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's outstanding mortgage loans stood at HK$1.26 trillion (US$161.3 billion) at the end of June, according to the monetary authority's data.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China Huawei, together with 10 state-owned financial institutions, have been selected to join a pilot programme that grants more flexibility for offshore funding, a statement issued by the </span><span class="s3">National Development and Reform Commission</span><span class="s1"> (NDRC) on Tuesday said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Companies involved in the pilot scheme could enjoy timing flexibility for issuing offshore bonds within their annual bond issuance quota. They could also use the proceeds in both offshore and onshore markets to bring down the loan cost, and improve the efficiency of using the proceeds,” the statement issued by the top economic planner said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chinese companies normally need NDRC's approval for each offshore bond issuance, while the proceeds raised overseas should not be remitted back to the domestic market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts said the move was made by the Chinese authority to enhance capital inflow, while encouraging banks to raise US dollars in offshore market that could also support the programmes in China's Belt and Road initiative.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Allowing more offshore issuances by local companies will help ease the outflow pressure as they bring the funding onshore. Local firms paying off offshore debt was a big driver of outflows between mid-2015 and mid-2016. With this policy, the authority seems to be trying to engineer the reverse,” said Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But he noted the challenge was whether local firms see the economic benefits of issuing offshore debt.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The offshore costs will consist of absolute US dollar funding rates and yuan and US dollar moves. Currently, I think US dollar funding costs remain higher than onshore for all these names, and the market still expects yuan depreciation,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Seven state-owned banks, including </span><span class="s3">Export-Import Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1"> of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, in addition to three financial institutions, namely China Life, China Huarong and China Cinda, together with China Huawei, were selected as the pilot scheme members.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> plans to loosen rules governing when foreign investors can bring money in and out of the country in a signal of its commitment to further open financial markets. The rule changes would apply to funds under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, which has granted about US$81 billion in quotas for overseas investment in China's domestic stocks and bonds, Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as saying on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The news came one day after Beijing unleashed a new rule to curb capital outflows. Mainlanders using UnionPay debit and credit cards to purchase insurance products overseas will face caps of US$5,000 per transaction, effective from Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Thomas Fang Dongming, head of China equities at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and its QFII representative, said it was "very likely" that the Chinese authorities would relax restrictions for QFII capital inflows and outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The relevant QFII regulators in China have been working to loosen control on this field, to make China's equity markets more accessible," he said. "It is still one of the top priorities to internationalise China's capital markets, and the regulators have been pushing for A share's inclusion in reputable global indices, although things have become a little tougher recently with China facing bigger capital outflow pressures."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Under the current rules, a foreign investor with a QFII licence is subject to a monthly quota and window to withdraw their investment or earnings, an industry insider said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The regulator has been mulling over the relaxation for more than two years. It originally planned to issue arrangements as early as last April, the source said .</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">On Monday, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), the foreign exchange gate keeper, denied media reports it was tightening offshore investments by domestic institutions. Reuters and Caixin reported earlier that several domestic funds had deferred the launch of new products under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) programme.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Many of our foreign investors are deeply concerned about the freedom for investing China, after the recent currency turmoil and China tightens control on capital accounts," a Shanghai-based brokerage analyst with a state-owned brokerage said. "The </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> will have another review for A-share inclusion this June, and it means a lot to Beijing."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">More than 40 Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong-listed companies have surged in the past three days, riding the wave of euphoria created by President Xi Jinping's ambitious plan to build Xiongan New Area - billed by many as the next Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Amid the frenzy, however, analysts have warned that some companies' exposure to the new area is not as large as the more optimistic investors seem to think. Indeed, the first wave of the rally may have already passed.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The initial enthusiasm can support at most three straight trading days,” said Liu Feifan, an analyst with </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1">. “The most likely scenario is intermittent Xiongan-spurred rallies. Any subsequent news about Xiongan could boost related stocks for a while, before they cool again.”The initial enthusiasm can support at most three straight trading daysLiu Feifan, analyst, Guotai Junan Securities</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That means investors will need to adopt a delicate, well-calculated strategy in which timing is everything, particularly in the mainland's volatile, speculation-driven market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Investors were quick to spot the real estate stocks with land banks in Xiongan: China Fortune Land Development (CFLD) and Kinghand Industrial Investment, both of which rose by their daily limit for three consecutive days.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Then there are </span><span class="s3">RiseSun Real Estate Development</span><span class="s1">, Juli Sling and Langfang Development that don't have direct exposure to the new area, but have projects in nearby cities. They have also surged by the daily permissible limit for three straight trading sessions. They soared 10 per cent immediately after the market opened on each day, leaving retail investors complaining that they barely got a chance to buy the stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">No Chinese builders listed in Hong Kong have land banks in Xiongan, but primary land development company LongiTech and </span><span class="s3">China Vast Industrial Urban Development</span><span class="s1"> have projects nearby. Primary land development involves relocating existing residents, building roads, and connecting to water, electricity and other utilities before selling the plots to developers. Such companies split their land sale and tax revenue with local governments.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong investors showed a more cautious approach. After surging as much as 70 per cent on Monday, the first day after the Xiongan plan was announced, LongiTech began to temper. By Friday, it was swinging between gains and losses. China Vast Industrial fell 2 per cent in the past three days.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Xiong, Rongcheng and Anxin - the three obscure Hebei counties 130 kilometres south of the capital selected as the site of the new economic zone - were transformed overnight from forgotten backwater to being the darling of mainland investors after </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> said the Xiongan New Area would be as important for China's future as Shenzhen and Shanghai Pudong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/07/52ad9e94-1b91-11e7-b4ed-ac719e54b474_image_hires_215129.jpg]The initial planned area is 100 square kilometres, which is expected to grow to 2,000 sq km. However, Morgan Stanley said in a Friday research note that its “base” projection is that it will take 15 years to complete 80 per cent of the planned migration of 5.4 million people and the addition of 2 trillion yuan in investment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hebei's property market is expected to be stimulated by investment-driven and speculative capital inflow in the short term, according to </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">What happens to a Chinese backwater when it becomes the centre of Xi Jinping's futuristic dream city?[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2084687/what-happens-chinese-backwater-when-it-becomes-centre]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But Liu said property sales in Xiongan have now been forbidden, and all nearby counties have imposed purchase restrictions. He said it is better to pick transportation, cement and steel stocks than developers as they will be natural beneficiaries of a coming infrastructure boom.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">LongiTech, as a solar power and primary land development company, does not own any land bank in Xiongan. It is favoured by investors because it is controlled by Wei Shaojun, one of the richest people in Hebei. He owns an unlisted commerce and property company that run 14 bazaars in Baigou, a town 10 kilometres north of Xiong. Baigou is known for its wholesale businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[http://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/07/53352f62-1b91-11e7-b4ed-ac719e54b474_image_hires_215129.jpg]China Vast industrial, like CFLD, engages in primary land development. It owns three industrial parks in Langfang, halfway between Beijing and Xiongan. It has other parks in the cities of Shijiazhuang and Zhangjiakou, both far from Xiongan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There are fears that previous development agreements may find themselves on hold, or shelved entirely by the Xiongan plan, which carries a much higher political priority.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Kinghand Industrial Investment in August 2014 signed a cooperation framework with Anxin county to develop an area of about 100 hectares. The non-legally abiding framework has not rendered the company any land plots so far, and there has been no progress since the agreement was signed.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Kinghand said it would “resolutely abide by” any central government decision - a euphemism for forgoing its development rights if Beijing asked it to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">CFLD said on Tuesday night that it has two projects planned: Baiyangdian Science and Technology City and Xiong County Industrial New City. The two developments are at the master planning phase and the company has not yet acquired any residential land plots in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The company has so far not been notified of any changes to the development frameworks it signed with the Xiong and Baoding governments in August 2016. There was speculation that the initial agreements had become invalid after the Xiongan announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">CFLD warned in its filing that there are “great uncertainties” in terms of possible policy change and long implementation periods for the agreements. This will not change the company's 2017 financial results.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mainland's key stock indicator slipped below the psychologically important 2,000-point level yesterday, entering a territory last seen nearly four years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index fell 26.3 points, or 1.3 per cent, to close at 1,991.17, the first time below the key level since January 23, 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">With the main gauge breaking through the symbolic barrier, investors are hoping the regulators will be stirred into action.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The government is doing nothing to help us," said Zhang Zhisheng, an investor who has lost 300,000 yuan (HK$373,600) in equity investments. "The new leaders [of the country] need to pay attention to the stock market. They can't just talk, it's time to take some action."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Breaching the 2,000 level can have disastrous consequences for the market as investors may become convinced that the downward spiral is irreversible.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China was the world's worst-performing stock market in the past two years. The composite index is down 9.5 per cent so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts had been expecting the index to eventually close below the 2,000-point level after it hit an intraday low of 1,995.17 in the afternoon session last Wednesday. Talk of a potential cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio that afternoon helped the market recover to finish higher.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Investors will be surprised to know that the securities regulator is also feeling hopeless," said a Beijing-based source close to the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Regulators are worried the index has now fallen below the threshold."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Since the 18th Communist Party congress ended on November 14, there has been speculation that the CSRC would step up efforts to reform the initial public offering system, seen by many as the cause of the lingering slump. Investors have been hoping the new party bosses will move to shore up the market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2008, when the market was stuck in a rut because of the worldwide financial turbulence, Beijing unveiled a 4 trillion yuan stimulus package to combat a slowdown at home. That effort sparked a rally as an influx of speculative capital breathed life into the market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The world finds itself in a similar situation today as Western economies go through a protracted slowdown. The </span><span class="s3">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</span><span class="s1"> yesterday cut its growth forecasts, warning of the risk of a "major" global recession and urged the </span><span class="s3">European Central Bank</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to ease their monetary policies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2009, a report by the State Council's Development Research Centre said at least 1.2 trillion yuan of banking loans were misused by corporate borrowers to speculate on stocks, part of the reasons why the mainland stock market bounced back from the depths of a crisis the last time.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We don't care whether the speculative mood was reasonable or legal [back then], we just want our money back," said Zhang, a retiree rehired as a security guard. "I hope [Vice-President] Xi Jinping will note the plight of the poor investors."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Communist Party is expected to hold an economic work conference next month to discuss key policies related to economic development. It is not known if the top leadership will give the beleaguered stock market a priority at the conference.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The key to a stock market turnaround is a massive capital inflow," Shanghai Vstone Capital president Chen Jiwu said. "The regulators have been encouraging equity investments but it will take some time before the efforts begin to show."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">According to Chen, who participated in a seminar hosted by the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> this year, the regulators are studying ways to liberalise the hedge fund sector, allowing fund managers to freely raise capital to trade stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The source close to the CSRC said the regulator would exercise caution in approving new stock offerings although there is a long pipeline of more than 800 listing applicants. The regulator has temporarily suspended approvals since October 10.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A flood of share offerings in the past two years were blamed for the market slump as they soaked up about 800 billion yuan of funds from the market. Ironically, China took the dubious honour of the world's No 1 IPO market in those two years.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The market is worried about another IPO blitz," said </span><span class="s3">Shenyin Wanguo Securities</span><span class="s1"> analyst Li Xiaoxuan. "A technical rebound would occur in the next few days, but a lack of solid economic and corporate fundamentals would make any rebound shortlived."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chinese banks are sailing into uncharted waters as they follow their wealthy corporate and retail clients abroad, though obstacles brought about by compliance investigations are unlikely to slow the momentum as mainland lenders buck the trend that has seen their foreign counterparts trim global operations, market observers said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some banks have already hit choppy waters.In September, </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1"> of China was ordered by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> to overhaul its protections against money laundering to address “significant deficiencies”, the US central bank said in a statement on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The lender, one of China's biggest banks, will have to come up with a written plan within 60 days to fix the shortcomings in managing risk in its New York branch and to maintain better control over suspicious activity, the Fed said. However, the order didn't carry a monetary penalty.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The slap on the wrist comes as domestic Chinese banks are poised to accelerate their overseas expansion over the next five years as they follow their clients abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“In the early stage of domestic banks' opening up in the past, it was more about embracing foreign players in the home market,” Liu Xinyi, president of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, told the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai in June. “But we have seen a growing trend in the past five years where more domestic lenders are making a foray into overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“China is transferring from capital inflow to outflow and financial institutions should move in tandem with those corporate clients to go abroad,” Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Overseas business, including offshore services, accounted for less than 5 per cent of </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Pudong Development Bank</span><span class="s1">'s total assets - which analysts say is far from enough considering the need to follow the trend of more and more Chinese companies going abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It has been common to see Chinese companies flex their muscles in overseas markets with rising outbound direct investment (ODI) in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/10/03/08416108-895e-11e6-afd1-1c0f6e75ba2c_image_hires.jpg]According to data from the Ministry of Commerce, China's ODI rose to a record high of US$145.67 billion in 2015, up 18.3 per cent from the year before, the second largest in the world after the United States. China's total accumulated ODI by the end of 2015 amounted to US$1.1 trillion, the world's eighth largest. It has risen for 13 straight years, with an annual average growth of 35.9 per cent. In the five years to the end of 2015, total ODI was 2.4 times that of the previous five year period.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Domestic banks are attempting to ride the wave by following their clients that are expanding abroad. By the end of 2015, more than 20 Chinese banks had set up nearly 1,300 outlets in 59 countries and regions overseas, according to a Bank of China research note.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ren Zhiyi, partner at domestic law firm </span><span class="s3">Fangda Partners</span><span class="s1">, said it is interesting to see Chinese banks accelerate their overseas expansion at a time when the traditional global players are scaling back their global footprint, especially cutting their retail business which involves heavy investment but contributes relatively lower income.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Chinese banks can learn from the experience of those global banks when expanding abroad, and avoid the same mishaps,” Ren said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Global players are restructuring their business operations in the post-financial crisis era. New York-based </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1">, which had a global retail empire spanning 50 countries a decade ago - from Tokyo to Tegucigalpa (Honduras) - has since sold or shut retail operations in more than half of those countries, including Guatemala, Egypt and Japan, Bloomberg reported in July.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The transformation of </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1">, and similar changes at </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and other global banks, isn't just about cutting expenses. It is also about looking for greater returns by focusing on the richest customers - high-net-worth individuals, large corporations and institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alfred Shang, a partner at consultancy </span><span class="s3">Bain &amp; Co</span><span class="s1">, said Chinese banks' overseas expansion initially focused on corporate banking, trade finance and transactional banking as these mainly served corporate clients with global strategies. “In recent years, we see them follow another type of wealthy clients - the high net worth individuals who look for opportunities to invest globally, especially against local capital market volatility,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">By far, the big-five state-owned Chinese banks are the main force behind the “go-abroad” trend while smaller banks are still playing catch up.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Not all banks have the enthusiasm and matching capability to go global,” said Shang. “The top 15 banks make up the majority of the ‘go-abroad' group.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Bank of China is leading its peers in terms of doing international business mainly through organic growth, partly thanks to its legacy as China's largest foreign currency bank. </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) </span><span class="s1">took a shortcut to rapid expansion by acquiring overseas banking assets. For example, ICBC bought 92.8 per cent of Turkey's </span><span class="s3">Tekstilbank</span><span class="s1"> and acquired a 60 per cent stake in South Africa's Standard Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> is also aiming high when it comes to international business, targeting foreign currency and overseas assets to account for 15 per cent of its total assets by 2020. Pre-tax profits from overseas businesses are projected to account for 7 per cent of the group's total by then.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Bank of Communications has also targeted international expansion as a key priority. The Shanghai-based bank has set up about 50 outlets in 15 overseas countries and regions and also acquired an 80 per cent stake in the Brazilian bank BBM.Not all banks have the enthusiasm and matching capability to go global</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, BoCom chairman Niu Ximing sees another expansion path besides opening branches and acquiring assets - setting up new lines of business. The bank set up a centre for financial market and transactional banking in Hong Kong, with the new business earning profits within the first year of operation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has been a natural target for mainland domestic banks wanting to expand overseas thanks to the city's unique gateway position as a mature, open market with free flow of goods, capital and talent. One example of this approach was the takeover of </span><span class="s3">Wing Lung Bank</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong by </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1">, the nation's six largest lender.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland banks are also ratcheting up their overseas expansion amid China's One Belt and One Road initiative that aims to revive historical trading routes by shifting part of China's industrial overcapacity to developing markets along the routes.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">By the end of last year, nine lenders had set up 56 outlets in 24 countries involving in the One Belt and One Road initiative, according to </span><span class="s3">BOC</span><span class="s1">'s research.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But it hasn't been all smooth sailing overseas. Chinese banks have been dragged into money laundering investigations conducted by overseas regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> last year instructed both Bank of China and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank Corp</span><span class="s1"> to improve their anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Six ICBC employees in its Madrid branch were arrested in February on suspicion of facilitating money laundering and fraud. ICBC issued a statement saying it has operated strictly within the law.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Separately, Italian prosecutors sought to indict 297 individuals and Bank of China as part of a massive money laundering investigation, Associated Press reported in 2015. The bank has denied any wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In April, a </span><span class="s3">LexisNexis Risk Solutions</span><span class="s1"> survey showed that respondents in China emphasised the commercial aims of international expansion when asked about drivers for AML initiatives.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Interestingly, respondents in China listed regulatory compliance as the lowest of their priorities by a wide margin,” LexisNexis said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The survey targeted AML, compliance and risk professionals in the financial services industry in six markets in Asia - China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The survey focused heavily on the banking industry, which accounted for 50 per cent of survey responses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Among the six markets, China had the highest average AML operational costs of US$12.4 million, mainly due to the greater number of large banks in China responding to the survey, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China is also experiencing the sharpest increase in compliance spending, with nearly three quarters of respondents stating that overall AML compliance costs increased 20 to 39 per cent in the past 24 months, and half the respondents expecting overall costs to increase 20 to 39 per cent in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, respondents in China also acknowledged that the rising AML burden also does some good for their businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Implementing an AML compliance programme revealed deficiencies in many of our processes, enabling us to correct these issues and improve as a firm,” the report quoted an AML officer at a leading Chinese bank as saying.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Annabella Fu van Bijnen, a partner with UK law firm Linklaters, said Chinese banks confront a combination of hurdles when going abroad, including understanding cultural differences and local regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, “I don't think Chinese banks will slow down their overseas expansion because of the recent bout of anti-money-laundering probes,” she said. “Chinese banks will learn from the lessons and gain experience.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the country's top banking watchdog, issued a notice in late March requiring banks to take measures to guard against risks when going abroad. These included</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">strengthening management of overseas branches and strictly complying with overseas regulations on banking supervision, tax and AML.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At its half-year meeting on July 14, the CBRC prioritised four major risk areas that it will pay more attention to during the second half, including overseas compliance.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Zhang Xingrong, head of banking research at BOC Institute of International Finance, said lenders will be more cautious and prudent and introduce tighter safeguard measures to adhere to the regulatory call.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Looking forward, Shang of </span><span class="s3">Bain &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> said Chinese banks need to do more strategic planning before they go abroad, and become more international in their management.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Unlike their industrial counterparts, Chinese banks have not really globalised their management team as much as frontrunners such as Huawei and Lenovo,” he said. “Banks still prefer sending bankers from China to the overseas market though they are leveraging senior bankers from Hong Kong and Taiwan, while actively exploring partnership opportunities with foreign banks.”</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's non-financial overseas investment nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 due to tighter capital restrictions and rising global uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Non-financial outbound direct investment fell 45.8 per cent year on year to US$48.19 billion in the first half, </span><span class="s3">China's Ministry of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> said on Thursday. In June alone, outbound investment dropped 11.3 per cent from a year earlier to US$13.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of 2016 Beijing introduced tighter controls over funds moving out of the country and increased scrutiny of domestic companies' foreign investments. Last month banking regulators said they were examining bank loans taken out by the country's top deal-making companies including </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, Fosun, HNA and </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/07/14/b3905dde-688d-11e7-8c84-2c9d21aee0d8_image_hires_204232.jpg]“Unreasonable outbound investments have been effectively curbed,” Gao Feng, a commerce ministry spokesman, said during a press conference in Beijing on Thursday. He noted that Chinese foreign investment in industries like property, hotels, cinemas and entertainment have dropped 82.5 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Behind China's boldest dealmaker HNA are billions in pledged shares[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2102540/behind-chinas-boldest-dealmaker-hna-are-billions-pledged-shares]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In particular, investment in overseas property fell 82.1 per cent year on year in the first half, accounting for just 2 per cent of total outbound investment during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Separately, data from merger and acquisition deals also confirmed the downward trend.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">According to consulting firm Mergermarket, deals by Chinese companies in the hotel, property and entertainment sectors surged 233 per cent year on year in 2016, reaching US$15.86 billion across 33 different transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The biggest deals included HNA acquiring a 25 per cent stake in </span><span class="s3">Hilton Worldwide Holdings</span><span class="s1"> for US$6.5 billion and </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1"> buying </span><span class="s3">Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts</span><span class="s1"> for US$5.5 billion. But starting from January this year, only 14 deals with a combined value of US$1.6 billion have been recorded, the lowest since 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/07/14/b3e73f6e-688d-11e7-8c84-2c9d21aee0d8_image_hires_204232.jpg]With regulations restricting capital outflow, the mainland has seen a shift back to domestic investment activity.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“China's stable and improved economic growth in the first six months helped strengthen domestic investors' confidence so that more capital stayed in the country,” Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Moreover, regional conflicts, more acts of terrorism and tighter regulations on foreign capital in some countries and regions have increased global uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Those factors actually hindered China's investment in overseas markets,” Gao said, without naming specific countries.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mergermarket's global M&amp;A report shows 27 fewer Chinese deals with Europe in the first half of 2017, with deal value dropping 65.7 per cent to US$25.6 billion across 59 transactions. That compares with the record of US$74.8 billion across 86 deals seen in the first half of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Geopolitical concerns over Brexit and terrorism attacks have discouraged foreign capital inflow to Europe.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3">UBS Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday joined a chorus of brokers including </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> that expect Hong Kong's stock market rally to continue on the back of capital inflow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Geoffrey Wong, head of global emerging markets and Asia-Pacific equities at </span><span class="s3">UBS Asset Management</span><span class="s1">, said the market would resume its uptrend despite the recent volatility that has seen the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index drop from a 10-year high reached last Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The bull run on Hong Kong's stocks has already lasted 21 months but the Hang Seng Index was still the cheapest on a valuation basis among the world's major indices, including the S&amp;P 500 Index, China's Shanghai Composite and Europe's Stoxx 600 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts from </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> said last month that China's "new-economy" stocks will help push Hang Seng Index to a historic high of 32,000 by the end of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing has recently stepped up efforts to manage excessive risk in the financial markets, triggering concerns that Chinese bond yields will continue their ascent while stocks will underperform global peers because of tighter liquidity conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The authorities seem to be quite aware of the impact on the financial markets, so they are giving a lot of time for the financial institutions to adjust," Wong said. "It will only cause a little bit of stock market volatility."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's securities regulator said that it was suspending the approval of new mutual funds that were meant for investing in Hong Kong's equity market, according to people familiar with the matter, putting a temporary cap on southbound capital.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The value of Hong Kong shares held by mainland investors through the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect programmes has grown over sixty fold since the end of 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of October, investors in China held HK$808.8 billion (US$103.6 billion) worth of shares through stock connect links, compared to HK$13.09 billion in 2014, the year the Shanghai link was set up, according to figures provided by the Hong Kong stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"I would interpret this move as dampening of volatility rather than any reversal of southbound trade, which generally I think should increase over time," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Moreover draft guidelines unveiled earlier this month for the asset-management industry that would ban financial institutions from guaranteeing investors against losses was likely to hurt only second tier banks and unlikely to cause much problem to China's big four banks, Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Financials will do well as banks' non performing loans come down and credit growth begins to pick up and also because the stocks are not expensive, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's transition away from fixed assets investments to services was very good for insurance, education, consumer cyclical stocks, while companies like Huawei and drone maker DJI were likely to benefit from the nation's digitalisation, Wong said, adding that he was overweight in IT, hardware, internet and e-commerce stocks.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Juliana Huang, a senior executive with a multinational company in Beijing, invested well during the property boom in the Chinese capital and over the years has owned several flats in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Like many Chinese investors, however, Huang has in recent times sought to liquidate some of her investments and move the funds overseas, in the belief they will be safer there. Her market of choice is the US, where she now holds a healthy portfolio of stocks and funds, all denominated in US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves hit a seven-month high[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2097339/chinas-forex-reserves-hit-seven-month-high]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The desire among China's wealthy to convert their yuan-based assets into foreign currencies has been a headache for Beijing. But despite its efforts to curb capital outflows, the problem has become one of the "grey rhino" risks to the economy that are considered too big to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose for a sixth straight month in July, suggesting Beijing's efforts to slow capital outflows and boost inflows were paying dividends. However, an economist said the growth in the figures should not be overplayed.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The rise in foreign exchange reserves is partly a result of currency valuation changes in the portfolio," said Wang Tao, chief China economist with </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">. "A rise in reserves doesn't mean a net capital inflow."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While the government does not release the currency structure of its reserve portfolio, it is generally estimated that the US dollar accounts for about two thirds of the US$3 trillion stockpile.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China to maintain tight rein on capital outflows despite gains in forex reserves[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/2101975/china-maintain-tight-rein-capital-outflows-despite-gains]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Thanks to a weakening greenback, the yuan has gained steadily against the US dollar this year. The movement is also likely to have led to an appreciation in assets dominated in euros and yen, resulting in a nominal rise in the nation's foreign reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Xie Yaxuan, chief economist with China Merchants Securities, estimated that the valuation change contributed to a nominal rise of US$29.1 billion in July, which in effect means China's reserves fell by US$5.2 billion in the month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Similarly, if measured by the Special Drawing Rights - the accounting unit used by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> - China's reserves have fallen in each of the past five months, from 2.2196 trillion SDR at the end of February to 2.1884 trillion at the end of July, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Another measure of capital flow, namely yuan positions resulting from foreign exchange purchases, has been in decline for 21 months, indicating a steady capital outflow. The better news for Beijing is that the fall in July was only 4.6 billion yuan, down from 34.3 billion in June.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Despite disciplining some of the country's big global deal makers, including </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, earlier in the year for their lavish overseas spending, the government still has a long way to go to stem the outward flow of investment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lu Zhengwei, chief economist with Industrial Bank in Shanghai, said the outflow pressure in the second half of 2017 "will be bigger than the first half".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Yu Yongding, an outspoken economist with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"> and a former adviser to the central bank, said that China has been facing serious capital flight for years and that the chronic problem is unlikely to go away any time soon.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Huang certainly has no plans to stop moving her money out of the country. She even hinted at ways to bypass the limit of US$50,000 worth of foreign currency that Chinese citizens are allowed to buy each year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">If a further 60 million Chinese thought like her, and each exercised their right to purchase exchange their maximum allowance of foreign currency, China's US$3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves would be wiped out overnight.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Consumer prices rose by 4.5 per cent in March from a year ago, slightly higher than the market consensus of 4.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That was higher than the 4.3 per cent average rate of increase in January and February, mainly due to the limited decrease in prices of holiday package tours, according to the Census and Statistics Department.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But the department predicted near-future inflation would be mild, given the low global inflation rate and modest growth of the local economy, a government spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But economists said consumers shouldn't expect living expenses to drop soon, as costs of mainland imports remain steady and changes in rents take time.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As the Hong Kong dollar appreciates against the yen and euro, locals are drawn to travelling abroad both as individuals and with group tours. Outbound tour bookings for Easter jumped 20 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Travel Industry Council.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But tour prices were just a small proportion to living costs. Among other components of the Consumer Price Index, the biggest year-on-year increase came from the combined costs of electricity, gas and water, which rose 21 per cent as some households had used up the government's one-off electricity subsidy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The next-largest rise was in housing costs, at 8.1 per cent, followed by a 4.5 per cent hike in the cost of meals bought outside the home.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Also yesterday, a survey of rents at 100 housing estates by Centaline Property Agency showed the first month-to-month decrease in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A rising stock market and an inflow of hot money prompted the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to inject another HK$7.75 billion into the local banking system, as it is obligated to defend the local currency peg.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Economists say the impact of capital inflow into the stock market is short-lived and is unlikely to affect consumer prices. Changes in rents are a more important factor, but it will take time to reach consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They expect this year's annual inflation rate to be less than 4 per cent, a smaller increase than last year's 4.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Although the Hong Kong dollar has strengthened against the yen and euro, the exchange rate against the yuan remains steady, </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Bank senior economist Ryan Lam said. That means living costs will remain stable as most of Hong Kong's imports come from the mainland.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Foreign bank's exposure to mainland China stood at US$1.89 trillion - a record high - at the end of the first half of this year, according to data from ratings agency Fitch.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Tighter liquidity on the mainland, easy liquidity in Hong Kong and Chinese corporates' growing global ambitions contributed to a rebound after a slower 2015 and 2016, Fitch said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Another factor for this year's high was international banks looking to mainland China for growth, although the ratings agency said a rapid expansion in such lending would bring higher risks with it.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“It is hard to say whether the rewards for foreign banks of lending more on the mainland outweigh the risks, but we are less sceptical now than we were a few years ago, when banks hadn't experienced any major losses and much of the lending was to companies hoping to take advantage of an appreciating yuan,” said Sabine Bauer, senior director, financial institutions at Fitch.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This strategy came to a sharp halt in 2015, when the yuan stopped appreciating against the US dollar and started to fall in value. “The unwinding of some of that lending is part of the reason for the slow down in foreign banks' mainland China exposure in 2015 and 2016,” Bauer added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This latest high point in lending is driven more by companies' real needs.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lending to the mainland from Hong Kong banks was worth US$996 billion at the end of June, also a record high.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Around two-thirds of this was from subsidiaries and branches of mainland banks operating in Hong Kong, who have been expanding aggressively.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland exposure accounted for 31 per cent of Hong Kong's total system-wide assets, up from 27 per cent at the end of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/08/2de13f74-c46c-11e7-9f00-d8b0ccf89a9f_image_hires_200147.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Raymond Yeung, the chief economist for Greater China at ANZ, said there were three factors behind the growth in mainland lending from Hong Kong banks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Interest rates are on their way up as the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> starts to shrink its balance sheet, so if I were a corporate treasurer, I would have looked to lock in a good borrowing rate early in the year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Also, we have seen tighter liquidity on the mainland and loose liquidity in Hong Kong, so it is easier to borrow in Hong Kong, and as well as that if a Chinese company wants to spend the money outside China, there are fewer restrictions if the company borrows in Hong Kong, than if it borrows in China and then looks to transfer the money offshore.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Strict controls placed on capital leaving the mainland by Chinese authorities have had an additional effect.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Because of the concerns about capital outflows, Chinese authorities have been encouraging companies to borrow offshore to invest within China, as that then shows up as a capital inflow,” said Carrie Li, economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank, although she said the factors driving mainland companies to borrow offshore were now starting to decline.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Concerns about capital outflows have declined, and liquidity on the mainland was looser in the third quarter, which should lead to slowing offshore borrowing,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and international banks have been looking to Asia, including mainland China, for growth at a time when returns in their home markets, especially in Europe, remain sluggish.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Last week, Stuart Gulliver, group chief executive of HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong and Europe, said the bank's “pivot to Asia”, announced in 2015, had driven more than 70 per cent of the group's adjusted profit in the first nine months of this year, and that it had lent US$1.1 billion more in the third quarter this year in south-eastern China's Pearl River Delta than it had in the same period in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">So much for the high hopes and hoopla over a "through train" that mainland investors could board to fill up their suitcases in Hong Kong with shares listed on its stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Three years on, and the heavily hyped cross-border exchange-traded funds (ETFs) look like they might end up as nothing more than good intentions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Today, two leading mainland mutual fund houses will begin taking subscriptions for the ETFs - "gifts" from President Hu Jintao to bolster the Hong Kong economy and market. But they are expected to receive a lukewarm response from investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the run-up to their launch, fund managers, analysts and investors on the mainland have warned Hong Kong investors that subscriptions to the ETFs are not likely to meet the high expectations with which they were marketed and would not give the stock market a much-needed lift.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">China Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> (CAM) and </span><span class="s3">E Fund Management</span><span class="s1">, the first two asset managers allowed by the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> (CSRC) to launch ETFs tracking Hong Kong indices, will take subscriptions until August 3.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The fund issued by CAM will be listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and the E Fund will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Neither company would disclose a targeted size for its fund, but the official Securities Times reported that each aimed to raise as much as HK$25 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The fund-raising might fail to live up to expectations," Chu Xiaofei, CAM's research head, admitted.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Investor confidence has been hurt by the market's weak performance, and the timing for the launch of new funds is not ideal."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The long-awaited cross-border ETFs were touted as a "through train" scheme when Beijing announced it in August 2007, but it was first delayed and then invalidated by the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in January 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2007, the announcement of the "through train" programme drove the Hang Seng Index up 36 per cent to a record high of 31,638.22 points on October 30.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Showing exuberant but ultimately doomed optimism, Hong Kong investors took it for granted that a massive capital inflow could help prices of H shares soar in line with their frothy A-share counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A Hong Kong fund manager said expectations of the "gifts" from Hu were the driving force behind a recent market rally and cautioned that for this reason it was likely to prove short-lived, as investors returned to focus on fundamentals.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland investors, meanwhile, show a reduced appetite for Hong Kong stocks because the discount on H shares from the prices of their A-share counterparts has shrunk.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The A shares of mainland companies with dual listings on the mainland and Hong Kong traded at an average 10 per cent premium to their Hong Kong peers on Friday, compared with as much as 74 per cent in October 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2007, mainland investors were enthusiastic about buying H shares, because they believed the prices of those shares would rise to catch up with the elevated prices of A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Even if the two ETFs were to raise HK$25 billion each, the combined value of HK$50 billion would account for less than 0.3 per cent of Hong Kong's total market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">On the mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, already one of the world's worst-performing indicators in the previous two years, has advanced only 1.1 per cent so far this year, with more than one-third of retail investors losing more than 30 per cent of their equity investments in the first half.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland brokerages have pre-empted regulators and stock exchanges in promoting the pending "through train" scheme, encouraging investors to hunt bargains as cross-border equity trading would create an arbitrage mechanism to help narrow the price gap between A and H shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Nearly three months before the official launch of the scheme, mainland brokerages are actively conducting preparatory work for the trading system, anticipating it to be a new growth engine for their lacklustre businesses in a weak A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wang Sheng, a </span><span class="s3">Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities</span><span class="s1"> analyst, said the through train scheme would likely become an important driving force for the slumbering A-share market amid strong cross-border capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges announced in April that they would officially launch the through train programme in six months, allowing investors on both sides to trade stocks on each other's market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland investors will be able to trade up to 10.5 billion yuan (HK$13.19 billion) of Hong Kong stocks a day and up to 250 billion yuan in total, while Hong Kong investors will be subject to a total quota of 300 billion yuan, or 13 billion yuan a day, for A-share trading.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">According to industry officials, mainland brokerages hope to take advantage of the cross-trading system to bolster their business growth, betting that an official debut of the scheme would trigger a huge increase in trading volume as retail investors chase short-term gains.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has been one of the world's worst-performing indicators since 2010, with investors shunning the A-share market in fear of a further slide.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Shanghai bourse recently started testing the trading system, with a clutch of major brokerages including </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> taking part.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Since it will be two-way traffic, the through train programme is unlikely to direct a massive fresh capital inflow to the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, analysts said cross-border capital flows could whet the buying appetite of investors who have been sitting on the sidelines for years.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland banks and insurers which see their A shares trade at a large discount to H-share counterparts would be chased by investors as the price gap narrowed, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> (CICC) report showed that on Monday, the A shares of dual-listed mainland banks lagged far behind their H shares. </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s A shares traded at a 20.3 per cent discount to its H shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"As foreign investors are expected to strongly buy A shares of the banks, driving the prices up, mainland investors are certain to follow," said West China Securities analyst Wei Wei. "A rising trading volume will eventually benefit the brokerages as they rake in more trading commissions."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange stipulates that Hong Kong investors can hold no more than 10 per cent of a mainland company's A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We feel it's safe to conclude that overseas investors are increasingly keen on those financial stocks whose A-H discounts are huge," CICC analyst Mao Junhua said in a research report. "The overseas buying will give a huge boost to mainland-listed financial stocks."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves saw the sharpest ever jump last year, up by US$508.4 billion to a record US$3.82 trillion, piling more pressure on an already strengthening yuan and underscoring the need for monetary reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The strong capital inflow, buoyed by higher interest rates and a 2.9 per cent appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar last year, showed no sign of abating and the trend would continue in the first quarter of this year, said economists.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some experts say they wouldn't be surprised if forex reserves exceeded US$4 trillion by the end of this year, while urging the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to review its monetary regime and encourage more capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Rising interest rates may lure more forex into China," said Joe Zhang, a former central banker and the founder of financial advisory firm Slow Bull Capital. "This boosts unwanted reserves, pushing up the currency even though it may not be undervalued at present."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Zhang, who has been advocating higher interest rates since last year, said China needs higher rates to cool its property bubble, reduce wasteful investments and minimise the extent to which ordinary savers end up subsidising business. But the central government has been dragging its feet in fully liberalising the credit market, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Market forces, however, have been driving interest rates higher, with interbank interest rates soaring to as high as 9 per cent from an average 3 per cent in June and December. The US$508 billion forex increase last year compares with US$130 billion in 2012 and US$334 billion in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A big chunk of last year's addition to the reserves came from the trade surplus, at US$260 billion. That surplus was 12.8 per cent higher than in 2012 and saw the biggest spike since 2009, when the financial crisis dented global demand.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A Nomura research report said trade was distorted by exporters' common practice of over-invoicing shipments in order to funnel hot money into the country's financial system by circumventing capital controls.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Forex reserves were also boosted in large measure by foreign direct investments (FDI), which leapt 5.3 per cent to a record US$117.6 billion last year, the Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday. The ministry said it anticipated "steady growth" this year on the back of improved global appetite for investments.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Hot money inflow pressures could still be strong at the moment," Bank of America-Merrill Lynch economist Lu Ting said. "China's rising rates, yuan appreciation with limited volatility since last year and market expectation of further yuan appreciation make yuan investments quite attractive."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">BBVA</span><span class="s1"> estimates the yuan will appreciate by 2 to 3 per cent this year against the greenback. Yesterday the yuan touched 6.0557 to the US dollar, inching closer to the psychologically important level of 6, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">ANZ chief economist Liu Ligang said Beijing should deal with the issue of forex reserves by setting up a more flexible exchange system.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said the central bank should encourage two-way capital flows by allowing private firms and residents to invest abroad, which he added could be done by lifting the annual cap of US$250,000 for mainland residents doing so.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mary Ludgin is a managing director at Chicago-based real estate management firm Heitman, which has about US$30 billion in assets under management worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">She owns equity in the firm, where she has been for 23 years. Half of the company’s shares are owned by 32 senior employees, and the other half by </span><span class="s3">Old Mutual</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ludgin is the author of numerous articles and research studies related to real estate markets, portfolio management and strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Compared with North America and Europe, Heitman’s investment in the Asia-Pacific is relatively small. What is the history of the firm’s investments in Asia?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: We opened our acquisitions office in 2008, but the global financial crisis interrupted that. We made our first investment in the region in 2011. It was in Australia. We invested in commercial office and industrial. The third investment was in a storage facility.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: What are your plans for the Asia-Pacific? Is it the right time to expand?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: Yes, it is. We have subsequently invested in a retail investment in Kuala Lumpur. We are scouting opportunities across major markets in the Asia-Pacific, including mainland China and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Do you have any acquisition targets in China?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: In light of the economic transition, structural shift, that is going on with the Chinese economy, our focus is likely to be those property types that are supported by demographic trends. That includes the elderly care sector.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We are also looking at logistics, recognising its importance for imports and exports and serving the need of the growing e-commerce sector.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Which cities on the mainland are your targets?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: Globally, the largest market has seen most significant capital inflow, but we find that they are often pricey at this point.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">One of our strengths is looking for the next set of markets, secondary markets. It is one of our investment strategies in the US and Central Europe. Likely it will be the strategy here in this region.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: What will be the first investment in China?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: I would say it will likely be a logistics investment. It is a hot sector now, a sector we know well.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Will we see the first investment this year?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: I cannot promise that.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Is your company interested in the residential sector in China?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: There is certainly demand there, but we do not think the bottom has been reached yet. We will be open to that when conditions are firm. But that will not be our first move.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: China is facing slowing economic growth. Does that create more opportunities for international funds?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: It tends to be a great period for long-term, patient capital that waits for opportunities. What we want to make sure is to see good pricing for assets and good fundamental demand. Both need to be present.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Do you expect capital prices of real estate assets to continue to drop?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: I expect they will, in the light of the uncertainty of slowing GDP growth. That will create great opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: The US economy is improving, and so is Europe. What are the global capital flows? Do you expect to see a lot of capital going into China?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: What we observe with our clients is a move up their risk spectrum in both the US and Europe, with significant interest in Asia, in the light of its relatively rapid economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Given the recovery of the European economy, some capital has shifted from opportunities in China to opportunities in Spain.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But no global investor will avoid investing in China. It is too powerful, it is too big. But it is complicated, so we need to be careful.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Among the cities in the Asia-Pacific, which will see good growth potential in the next five years?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: From our investment perspective, clearly Tokyo is an area of significant potential. Even as we are seeing the population declining in the country, Tokyo is growing. Our strategy is in residential, retail, offices. and storage as well. It is a rich place from an investment opportunity perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Under the company’s structure, 50 per cent of the company’s shares are owned by 32 senior employees and 50 per cent owned by </span><span class="s3">Old Mutual</span><span class="s1">. Can you tell us more about it?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: Fifty per cent is owned by about 10 per cent of the professional staff of our firm. I believe it is rare among firms owned by partners.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Our financial partners provide us with capital – they are hands off when it comes to day-to-day operations. The structure produces profitability and alignment of interests.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Q: Do you have any unforgettable experiences?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A: I’ve led the research group for just under 20 years. During that time, we have helped Heitman expand its business into specialty property types such as self-storage that have delivered outsized returns and added considerably to our clients’ real estate portfolio performance. We began investing in the self-storage sector 17 years ago. Over that period, we have made US$5 billion in self-storage investments across 18 ventures.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">India's adoption of net neutrality this month caps off years of campaigning for an open and fair internet in the world's second most populous country, made more significant by the fact that the principle essentially just died in the United States, the internet's birthplace.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Few nations in Asia are likely to follow India's lead, however, given a general lack of public awareness and the tight grip telecommunication providers hold over many policymakers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Net neutrality rules guarantee fair access to the internet by prohibiting service providers (ISPs) from slowing connections - known as throttling - or prioritising access to certain websites or applications.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This month, in a landmark move, India's interministerial telecom commission agreed to recommendations from regulators that ensure India's 1.3 billion people have equal access to all online content at the same speed and cost. This includes the banning of “blocking, degrading, slowing down or granting preferential speeds or treatment to any content”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some services are eligible for exemption, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), autonomous driving and remote diagnosing services that by nature require faster internet connections. Net neutrality supporters welcome the ruling, saying that India now has a firm standing against any attempts to create slow- and fast-lane access to the internet.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We now have the strongest net neutrality regulations in the world,” says Nikhil Pakhwa, co-founder of Internet Freedom Foundation, which has led the campaign for net neutrality in India since 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">India's decision is in stark contrast with the US, where the principle was laid to rest in June, barring a reversal in the courts, after the country's </span><span class="s3">Federal Communications Commission</span><span class="s1"> dismantled the Obama-era rules last year, deeming them to have hampered investment in broadband infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“It's basic economics: the more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you're likely to get,” Ajit Pai, the FCC's chairman, said in a speech in April last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Pakhwa begs to differ, saying that net neutrality adoption won't affect investments in India, as the country's large population will continue to attract capital inflow from multinational companies such as </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1"> and Apple, among others.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“In terms of the number of internet users, India has the second-largest user base in the world; no company can [afford to] ignore the Indian market,” Pakhwa said. “What net neutrality enforces is that there is fairness in how you operate … it brings certainty and creates a level playing field for everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts fear that the repeal of net neutrality in the US could hurt efforts to implement the concept elsewhere in Asia, which is already lacking protections against throttling or paid prioritisation by ISPs or tech companies. In the region, ISPs often split monthly mobile data packages into a bundle of services, such as social media and their preferred streaming platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The net neutrality movement in other Asian countries is not as big as the one in India. Internet infrastructure in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore are owned by the government or state-owned enterprises, and these countries rarely discuss net neutrality,” says Damar Juniarto, regional coordinator at Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet). “In Indonesia, net neutrality is seen as a matter of business competition, the discussion about it never touches the root of the problem, which is a fair public service to all.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In India, the campaign for net neutrality was triggered in 2015, when Airtel, the country's largest telecom provider, planned to charge extra for VoIP services such as Skype. Airtel also had a tie-up with e-commerce behemoth </span><span class="s3">Flipkart</span><span class="s1"> for a platform called Airtel Zero, which basically gave users free access to </span><span class="s3">Flipkart</span><span class="s1">'s website, while other websites were still charged - a cherry-picking practice dubbed as “zero rating”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Airtel scrapped the plan and the platform following public outrage, which eventually spawned a broader discussion in India over the importance of net neutrality. The issue later received support from all political parties.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Another trigger is </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s zero-rating platform called Free Basics, part of the social media giant's Internet.org initiative to bring more people online, particularly in the developing world. On Free Basics, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> offers a selection of websites, including its own, for free, which critics claim is equivalent to a “walled garden”. Users can only access sites chosen by </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and its local telecom partners. The platform was banned by India's telecom regulator after it was found in violation of net neutrality tenets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Despite being halted in several other countries, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> says their Internet.org programme has brought nearly 100 million people online so far.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Most countries [in Asia] do not have a net neutrality policy. There is none in Hong Kong, or mainland China,” says Michelle Chan, partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Bird and Bird. “However, this does not mean that operators are not subject to constraints. From a legal perspective, there are tools regulators could potentially rely on to ensure that ISPs and consumers alike are offered a fair service. The usual techniques include relying on consumer protection laws, competition laws and unfair trade practice regulations.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In September, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> halted its Free Basics offering in Myanmar after a regulator imposed floor pricing for all internet services. The new rules prohibited ISPs, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s local partner, state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunication, to offer free SIM cards, which effectively ended zero-rated services.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Singapore, ISPs are not allowed to block legitimate internet content or impose extreme throttling that inhibits access the internet.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In China, discussions are underway to implement “some form of net neutrality policy” to foster further the growth of innovations in the internet, Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While relishing their victory, net neutrality advocates in India say they must remain vigilant. The mission is now to fend off any attempts to bend net neutrality rules in any way. Following the demise of its Free Basics platform in India, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> teamed up with Airtel to launch another Internet.org initiative called Express Wi-fi, which provides wireless internet connections at low costs for small and medium enterprises. In Asia, Free Basics is still available in 10 countries including Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“India's net neutrality should be replicated elsewhere in the world, and we would be happy to assist [net neutrality supporters] in any way,” Pakhwa said. “Large companies like </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> will always try to control the internet. The internet belongs to users, and it is our responsibility that the generations that come online after us get the same access.” ■</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">After three rejections since 2014, MSCI is set to rule again on Wednesday whether it will accept China's domestic A shares in its US$1.5-trillion emerging markets index.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While it may be the best chance so far for China to get the nod, many analysts anticipate the real impact will be minor as the resulting capital inflows will be limited in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A number of funds and investment banks are now favourable on MSCI's acceptance of A shares, including Robeco, </span><span class="s3">AXA Investment</span><span class="s1"> Managers, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corp</span><span class="s1"> (CICC).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said Friday that "the pace of China's reform" will not be affected by MSCI's decision.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"China will be glad to see it happen, if MSCI decides to include A shares. But regardless of the result, the direction and pace of China's capital market reform and opening up will not change," he said at a press conference.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">CSRC ‘welcomes' MSCI inclusion of A-shares in upcoming index review[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2098745/cbrc-urges-msci-include-shares-upcoming-index-review]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">MSCI has rejected A shares repeatedly on concerns over accessibility for international investors, restrictions on repatriation of capital, and licensing restrictions imposed by Chinese authorities for A-share index products in overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Given Beijing's progress in clearing the hurdles and MSCI's proposal in March to narrow the universe of stock picks, many analysts said this year represents the best chance for A shares to join the MSCI club. However, they also predicted the real impact to be small.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Even if included, the symbolic significance is much bigger than the real impact on capital inflows to China," said Li Lifeng, chief strategist for </span><span class="s3">Sinolink Securities</span><span class="s1">. "In the short term, it's more of a boost to the general risk sentiment."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The MSCI EM Index is followed by many global funds. Adding A shares to the index would trigger inflows into China's domestic stock markets due to fund mandates.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, since MSCI has narrowed the universe of stock picks to 169 from 448 previously and decided to only include initially 5 per cent of the free-float market cap, the expected capital inflow to China will be small.Regardless of the result, the direction and pace of China's capital market reform and opening up will not changeZhang Xiaojun, </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Theoretically, the initial inclusion could trigger fund inflows of 79.6 billion yuan (US$11.6 billion), Li estimated. The number pales in contrast to A shares' current margin loan balance of 867 billion yuan and the daily trading turnover of 400 to 600 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"It looks like a mere drop in the bucket," Li said. "Not to mention that the inflows will take place in a slow process.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, Li conceded that in the long term the inclusion will encourage global investors to raise their China-related portfolio holdings, which would prompt A shares to go global.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Earlier lastweek, Morgan Stanley analysts Laura Wang and Jonathan Garner expressed similar views.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Regardless of the outcome, we do not think there will be a meaningful impact at index level on the A-share market in the near term," they wrote in a report.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They see a more than 50 per cent chance of MSCI adding A shares, which could boost the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index by 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent "on announcement".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, actual implementation would not take place until June 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Besides, with a 5 per cent initial inclusion factor, eligible A-share stocks would represent only 0.5 per cent weight in the MSCI Emerging Markets index.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Collectively for global passive AUM (assets under management) that track MSCI indices, the A-share inclusion would add only US$1 billion to US$1.5 billion of passive fund inflows, a very small fraction of total A-share market cap and trading volumes," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">If MSCI says "No", A shares may react with a 1 per cent decline, which is still "minor", the analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Over the longer term, the inclusion will represent a "milestone" in China's capital market development and integration with the rest of global markets, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">AXA Investment</span><span class="s1"> Managers also believe this year is the "best chance" for A shares to join the MSCI global equity indices.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, such an event does not "necessarily guarantee" large capital inflows immediately, especially if investors lack confidence in Chinese equities, AXA analysts Aidan Yao and Varun Ghotgalkar wrote in a research report.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They expect US$1.6 billion of initial flows into the A-shares market from global passive exchange-traded funds tracking various MSCI indices.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">On the other side, a few investment institutions hold more conservative views on the probability of MSCI's acceptance.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chance of China A-shares added to MSCI is less than half, says UBS[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2098172/chance-china-shares-added-msci-less-half-says-ubs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">UBS Wealth Management earlier last week said there could be a less than 50 per cent chance for A shares to get approved this time around given the biggest remaining hurdle - the required CSRC approval for foreign institutions to launch any A-share linked derivative in overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> recently reduced its forecast of the odds to 60 per cent from last year's 70 per cent due to investors' remaining concerns on capital repatriation and approval restrictions on derivative products.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Goldman analysts predicted the impact to be bigger in the long term, as the inclusion of A shares could encourage inflows of US$210 billion over the next five years.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing's municipal financial regulator has warned private equity (PE) funds not to continue investing in initial coin offerings (ICOs), a practice banned by the mainland's central bank three months ago.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Huo Xuewen, chief of the Beijing Bureau of Financial Work, said in a report published on Sunday that some of the funds had been found taking part in ICOs - fund-railings by the issuers of digital currencies such as bitcoin - outside the regulatory framework and he pointed out it was a wrongdoing that the regulator would seek to weed them out.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Long term, those practices are misleading and wrong," he was quoted by Securities Times as saying.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He added the authorities now plan to set up a strict monitoring system to track operations and investments by PE funds.ICOs have become not only illegal fundraising schemes, but have caused damage to China's foreign-exchange management systemCao Yin, chief strategist at Energy Blockchain Labs</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Huo did not reveal the names of the funds, nor did he mention the amounts involved.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's central government is taking a harsh stance on ICOs, part of its stepped-up efforts to clean up the financial technology (fintech) industry and control financial risk.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In early September, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> announced any fundraising schemes via ICOs were defined as illegal after it found 90 per cent of those launched on the mainland were fraudulent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"ICOs have become not only illegal fundraising schemes, but have caused damage to China's foreign-exchange management system," said Cao Yin, chief strategist at Energy Blockchain Labs.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The illegal businesses have become rampant and it is understood that regulators will significantly tighten their oversight of the fund raisings."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some of the PE funds Huo referred to, include investment products registered with the Asset Management Association of China, a government-backed consortium of financial institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of September, more than 12,000 PE funds in China were registered.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Private PE fund managers and venture capitalists in China have been learning some tough lessons over the past two years after a rising number of their firms collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Despite the increasing penetration of digital businesses into the mainland market, dozens of start-up technology firms dealing with e-commerce, online-to-offline businesses and peer-to-peer lending, failed and faced liquidation.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Many start-ups have been using the money they raised as subsidies to attract more online traffic from customers and to force out rivals, only to find that in reality that did now support a solid business model.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Private equity and venture capital investment in the telecommunications, media and technology sectors has dropped significantly as fund managers turned extremely cautious in their deal making.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"China's private equity and venture capital industries are still short of experienced, high-calibre asset managers," said Cao Hua, a partner at Unity Asset Management. "Some of them would just flock to any hot areas where returns turn out to be high."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">ICOs, which allow digital currency start-ups to raise funds through creating and selling digital "tokens", was one of the hottest areas to attract massive capital inflow in the first seven months of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Beijing internet Finance Association estimated 65 </span><span class="s3">ICO</span><span class="s1"> transactions were completed in the period, netting a combined 2.6 billion yuan (US$394 million) in funding.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China was a net purchaser of foreign currency for a second straight month in February, reflecting increasing capital inflows, easing liquidity conditions and rising confidence in the yuan last month, economists said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> bought a net 25.12 billion yuan (HK$30.74 billion) of foreign currency last month compared with a net purchase of 140.9 billion yuan in January, after three consecutive months of net sales, the central bank said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"This shows that the country has seen net capital inflows again for the past two months and the central bank needs to purchase foreign currency to keep the yuan at its current level," said Liu Ligang, </span><span class="s3">Australia and New Zealand Banking Group</span><span class="s1">'s chief China economist.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The fact that China received a net capital inflow in February despite the largest trade deficit in a decade and a drop in foreign direct investment showed that more investors, including commercial banks, could be selling US dollar assets, and buying more yuan in February, said Liu.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China posted a US$31.5 billion trade deficit last month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lu Ting, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, added that the data reflected rising confidence in the Chinese economy in February, leading to less capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But Lu said market sentiment had changed since then, with investors upbeat and expecting further appreciation in the yuan against the US dollar during Vice-President Xi Jinping's visit to the US last month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, yuan exchange rate volatility has picked up again, especially after central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said this week that the yuan was getting closer to fair value against foreign currencies, rejecting international calls for Beijing to accelerate the yuan's appreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's foreign currency reserves - which are the world's largest - totalled US$3.181 trillion at the end of December.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lufax, the world's second-largest financial technology firm, is gearing up to launch a platform to facilitate Chinese investors' asset allocation around the globe amid a depreciating yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The internet finance business of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, China's largest insurer by market value, will target millions of cash-rich mainlanders who already have offshore assets, helping them chase returns on the overseas equity markets via cyber space.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Gregory Gibb, chief executive of Lufax, told reporters on Wednesday that a complete online platform will be established in 2017, granting wealthy mainlanders legal access to foreign capital markets to cater to their surging demands for asset diversification.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lufax formed a partnership on Wednesday with </span><span class="s3">eToro</span><span class="s1">, an Israeli fintech firm that pioneered the revolutionary concept of social trading.Demand for overseas investment among Chinese people and businesses is constantly increasingGregory Gibb, CEO, Lufax</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The tie-up is a concrete step for Lufax toward launching its internationalised trading platform and follows an agreement signed with Denmark-based </span><span class="s3">Saxo Bank</span><span class="s1"> in May, which also enables mainland investors to buy equities on the global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yoni Assia, chief executive of eToro, said the partnership with Lufax could help it attract “thousands of mainland investors” keen on buying overseas equities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing has tightened foreign-exchange controls over the past two weeks as it ramps up efforts to stem capital outflows amid mounting speculation of further devaluation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But the so-called “window guidance” - administrative measures to curb cash outflows - are unlikely to dent the appetite for foreign currency assets among mainlanders fearful of a downward spiral in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the past few years, millions of mainland residents - most of them high-net-worth individuals or middle-class clerks - have remitted part of their cash abroad and sought lucrative foreign investments such as properties and equities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2007, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ruled that each mainlander is allowed to buy up to US$50,000 worth of foreign currencies a year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The rule is still effective now, and gives Chinese people a legal channel through which to diversify their assets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is likely to announce an interest rise on Wednesday, adding pressure to an already weak yuan and prompting Beijing to take further drastic steps to control cross-border cash flows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The tightening measures are aimed at striking a balance between capital inflow and outflow at this critical moment,” said Shao Yu, chief economist with Orient Securities, adding that China would continue to liberalise its capital account at a gradual pace.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Among the world's fintech companies, Lufax trails only </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, an affiliate of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post, in terms of value.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">After its latest round of financing early this year, the company was valued at US$18.5 billion. It is also seeking an overseas stock market listing.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of September, Lufax had 25.5 million users, up 39.3 per cent from the beginning of the year.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Exchange Fund, whose reserves are used to defend the local currency, has lost HK$18.7 billion in the third quarter as a result of the valuation loses of its forex holdings and in Hong Kong stocks, according to the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, which manages the investment fund.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam told legislators about the Exchange Fund’s performance in the regular monthly Financial Affairs Panel meeting on Monday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The third quarter loss was mainly due to HK$28.4 billion in valuation loses in its euro holdings, with the pound and yen dropping in value against the US dollar during the period under review. The euro dropped 7.7 per cent against the US dollar and the yen decreased by 7.6 per cent. The pound was also down 5 per cent during the time covering the referendum on Scotland’s independence bid from the UK.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Exchange Fund’s Hong Kong stocks’ valuation also lost HK$200 million. This was partly offset by a HK$7.1 billion gain from its bond investments and a HK$2.8 billion gain from overseas stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The third quarter loss meant total gains in the first nine months now stood at only HK37.7 billion, down sharply from the HK$56.4 billion gain the first half of 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Exchange Fund paid HK$6.7 billion to the government during the third quarter and paid HK$20.6 billion in the first nine months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Several lawmakers questioned Chan on whether Occupy Central street protests have hurt international investors and led to a loss of confidence in the local market. They also questioned if any speculators have shorted the stock market to take advantage of its recent weak tone.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We have not yet seen an unusual situation in the stock market (and) there are no unusual movements of capital inflow or outflows in the city during the past one month after the Occupy Central movement started,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He however said some private banks have received some enquiries from high net worth clients on whether they should move money out of the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“They only made enquiries but have not moved the money out. We have to understand these high net worth clients have many choices that they could put their money in like Switzerland, Singapore or other markets. It would all depend on when and how the Occupy Central movement would end to see if these private bank clients and other international investors would see Hong Kong,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said some credit rating agencies have warned the city’s rating maybe affected if the Occupy Central protests drag on.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some 44 bank branches were shut during the protests, but only one branch still remains shut at this time due to protest, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Legislator Starry Lee Wai-king said the HKMA would need to take actions to make sure Beijing officials still have confidence in Hong Kong to carry out the many reforms for the mainland, such as pushing the now delayed plan to connect the stock markets between Hong Kong and Shanghai.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong home prices surged to a record high this year, ignoring the government's introduction of tough measures designed to cool the red-hot property market, as the rally extended for a fifth straight year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But there are a wide range of views about the likelihood of it lasting much longer, with interest rates likely to rise amid fierce market competition.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While some market watchers predict prices will fall by up to 10 per cent next year, others say they will level off or even rise by 10 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The property bubble was already building up in Hong Kong, otherwise the government wouldn't have needed to roll out a slew of cooling measures to cap price growth [in November 2012]," said Eddie Hui Chi-man, a real estate professor at Polytechnic University.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said that as interest rates headed for an upward trend, home prices in Hong Kong could drop by 3 to 5 per cent next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alfred Lau, a property analyst at Bocom International, has downgraded the residential market outlook for the first time in three years, mainly due to the recent price overshoot and weaker rental outlook.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We believe rental growth has been the strongest support to property prices in the past three years," Lau said. "However, with increasing property deliveries starting from the first half of next year and a weaker economic outlook, we expect rents to plateau going forward, and property prices may be at risk on the downside in the event of renewed rate rise fears or a further deterioration in the global economic outlook."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said he was expecting a 10 per cent correction in property prices next year that could even blow out to 20 per cent if it coincided with the beginning of the rate increase cycle.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The secondary market may face an even steeper correction," Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Centaline Property Agency said its latest Centa-City Leading Index, which tracks secondary home prices at 100 housing estates, eased 0.09 per cent week on week to 132.69 for the week to Wednesday after hitting a record of 132.81 the previous week. It has risen 14 per cent this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Thomas Lam, head of valuation and consultancy at Knight Frank, said luxury and mass residential prices would follow different patterns next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"With the implementation of double stamp duty, prices in the luxury residential market have experienced mild downward pressure this year and are expected to drop modestly, by less than 5 per cent in 2015, while mass residential prices could remain stable given strong demand for small and medium-sized flats," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The affordability ratio - average mortgage payments as a percentage of average household incomes - was now around 60 per cent in Hong Kong, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"If the mortgage rate is lifted by 200 basis points, the ratio will rise to more than 70 per cent, and if it's lifted by 300 basis points, the ratio will rise to 80 per cent," he said. "Therefore, we estimate that a mortgage-rate rise of less than 300 basis points will not have a significant impact on Hong Kong's residential market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Lam said future residential supply would mostly come from Yuen Long and Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories, followed by Kai Tak in Kowloon, while Hong Kong Island would have limited supply.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But property consultant JLL Hong Kong has a different take on the residential outlook, with its head of research Denis Ma saying home prices would remain flat next year or may even have some upside potential.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">His optimism comes in the wake of market expectations of slower interest rate rises in the United States due to sliding oil prices. He said US interest rates could start to increase in the second half of next year instead of the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"But the upside potential for price growth will be limited to about 5 per cent," Ma said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Centaline Property Agency's Asia-Pacific chief executive, Addy Wong, said he expected residential prices would increase by 10 per cent in the first quarter of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The strong financial ability of locals and continuing trend of capital inflow into the city will spur property demand and drive up home prices next year," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This year, home sales turned around in the second quarter when a proposed relaxation of the double stamp duty was announced in May.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"A marked increase in home transaction volume was observed in the second half of the year," said Alva To, managing director for Hong Kong and head of consulting for North Asia at property consultancy DTZ.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">With developers rushing to launch new projects to tap the pent-up demand after the easing of curbs, the number of transactions rebounded 16 per cent to more than 60,000 at the end of last month, compared with just 51,770 for the whole of last year, according to Midland Realty.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Sammy Po, chief executive at Midland's residential department, said home buying interest would continue to be focused in the primary markets as developers' discount sales would lure potential buyers away from the secondary market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said he expected the number of transactions in the primary market this year would be more than 16,000 with total value climbing to a record HK$170 billion. "The number of transactions for new homes will continue to increase to 18,000 next year," Po said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan could breach another key psychological level this year to trade at 6 to the US dollar as the mainland authorities seem inclined to ease the reins on the currency further.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Spot yuan closed yesterday at 6.1287 per dollar in Shanghai. It has been hitting 19-year highs frequently in the past few months and has strengthened about 1.7 per cent against the dollar since April.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That has already surpassed the 1.03 per cent appreciation for the whole of last year, as capital unleashed by quantitative easing in developed countries flooded into China betting on robust economic growth and greater financial reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Notably, the yuan's rally continues unabated even after mainland officials and economists earlier this year said the currency had reached its equilibrium.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"There has been a policy to drive down dollar-yuan fixing since the end of March and this will continue through both the June 7-8 US-China meetings and the July 8-12 Sino-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue," Nomura Securities economists Craig Chan and Teo Wee Choon wrote in a research note.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They expect the yuan to strengthen to 6.13 by the Sino-US dialogue date and 6.05 by the end of this year, based on Beijing's increasing tolerance for yuan appreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"It is possible for spot dollar-yuan to fall below the 6 figure, when considering a potential widening of the yuan trading band from the current 1 per cent to 2 per cent," they said in the note.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yi Gang, a deputy governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said at an </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> conference in Washington in April that the yuan's trading band would soon be widened.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Many economists expect the band, within which spot yuan is allowed to float, will be broadened to 1.5 to 2 per cent either way of the daily reference rate set by the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The official announcement could come as early as this month, they say, before President Xi Jinping makes his first trip to the United States after assuming power.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">When former president Hu Jintao visited the White House on January 19, 2011, the central parity rate fell by 66 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wang Tao, an economist at UBS Securities, said she was "puzzled" by the yuan's persistent appreciation as it was not supported by economic fundamentals.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The country's trade surplus totalled US$43 billion in the first quarter but the surplus adjusted for overstated exports to Hong Kong was only US$2.4 billion, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">With the current account surplus set to narrow and the growth of foreign direct investment likely to slow as the mainland economy gears down, further gains in the yuan should be limited, according to Wang.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We expect the fixing to stay around 6.20 at the end of this year, but it could end the year 1 to 2 per cent higher given the central bank's desire to boost the exchange rate and the possibility of the capital account liberalisation coming sooner rather than later," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The State Council last month announced that an operational plan to achieve full convertibility would be presented this year, indicating that steps towards a market-based exchange rate system and capital account liberalisation may be accelerated.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The IMF estimates the actual value of the yuan was 4.214 to the dollar last year, based on purchasing power parity.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But Joanne Yim, the chief economist at Hang Seng Bank, said the yuan was undervalued by 0.6 per cent to 10.1 per cent last year, depending on the approach used to calculate its true value.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A 10 per cent strengthening of the yuan against the Hong Kong dollar could cause the city's consumer inflation to rise by about 0.5 percentage point, assuming a complete exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices, Yim said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The estimated effect may appear to be rather modest compared with the general perception," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Raymond Yeung Yu-ting, a senior economist at </span><span class="s3">ANZ Banking</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong, however, said yuan appreciation would not drive up inflation significantly in the city. The bank maintains its forecast that the yuan will reach 6.15 per US dollar by the end of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The recent advance in the yuan exchange rate, which was driven by capital inflow, would be sustainable," Yeung said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Inclusion of China's A shares in the closely followed MSCI index is almost a certainty by next year and could spark a flood of foreign capital into the country's tightly controlled capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The timing though is tricky after MSCI chose last year not to include mainland stocks in the face of resistance from large institutional fund managers such as </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> and Templeton.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We see this as a 50-50 chance event but the conditional probability (if no for this June) for inclusion next year is close to 100 per cent," analysts at </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> said in a research note, noting that the chances of getting into the international benchmarks will be higher next year given the pace of market liberalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Goldman said MSCI's decision to include China's A shares could be significant and see long-lasting capital inflow in the country's stock markets, with an estimated US$17 billion of net buying per year based on an additional market cap of US$110 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That assumption has factored in a combination of passive and active fund flows including traditional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The research report suggested though that the top-down estimated is vulnerable to a high margin of error, given the swing factors like size and classification of global liquidity pools, the pace of liberalisation of China's capital markets, as well as allocation going into A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Foreign investors' access through authorised channels to China's onshore markets was US$175 billion in March, representing 5.9 per cent of the free-float A shares market cap, it said. That compares with a 31 per cent foreign institutional investors' ownership in Korea, and 36 and 20 per cent in Taiwan and India, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At present, foreign investors can invest in China's domestic market via two quota schemes and the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect programme launched last November.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing launched the qualified foreign intuitional investor programme in 2002, making it the first channel for foreign investors to access the domestic capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Though the end of April, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which manages the country's almost US$4 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, has approved 268 firms to have a combined quota of US$73.6 billion under the QFII regime, while 112 investors received a quota of 363.7 billion yuan in the renminbi version of QFII, also known as RQFII.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts at Jefferies expect the stock connect programmes with Shanghai and eventually Shenzhen will help pave the way for inclusion of the A shares into global stock indices, with new capital flows seen hitting US$150 to US$200 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Foreign investors make up of only 1 per cent of turnover in A shares, compared with the 80 per cent generated by retail investors, according to Jefferies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Since the inception of the stock connect, the daily quota of 13 billion yuan in the northbound trade was used up for only one time, in part due to technical problems like the pre-trade checking requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">After consulting with industry participants, the Hong Kong stock exchange rolled out the special segregated account system (SPSA) in April to alleviate the problem of exposing their orders.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chinese stocks and the yuan exchange rate both had a bumpy ride in the first trading days of this week, as risk aversion gripped the markets due to a slew of uncertainties, in particular the </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1">'s announcement on A share inclusion due overnight.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Brokers said other uncertainties include a possible departure of Britain from the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1"> after the June 23 referendum, as well as policy decisions by the US and other major central banks at meetings slated for later this week.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In equity markets, mainland China's Shanghai Composite Index opened lower on Tuesday and swung between small gains and losses for most of the session. It closed slightly higher by 0.3 per cent or 9.12 points at 2,842.19. Nevertheless, the index failed to recoup heavy losses from Monday, when it plunged 3.2 per cent to post its biggest daily fall since February 25. In the first two days of this week, the Shanghai Composite Index slid 2.9 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Investors are nervous as they wait for the other shoe to drop on Wednesday, when </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> will announce its decision on the inclusion of A-shares,” said Xie Cheng, an analyst for Huatai Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“If it were to be included, we would feel a bit more confident about A shares though it isn't likely to bring in a huge capital inflow,” added Shen Ye, a Shanghai-based hedge fund manager. “If the </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> opts not to accept A shares this time, a slide in the market can be expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Looking ahead, Cheng isn't optimistic about the A-share markets in the near term.While there are no expectations for action from the Fed and the BoJ, their post-decision comments will still matterBernard Aw, </span><span class="s3">IG Group</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Even if A-shares were included, market volatility will still increase, as there are still a number of risks and uncertainties out there, including the Brexit and potential interest rate hikes by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> later in the year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Brexit refers to Britain's decision on whether to keep its membership of the European trading bloc. Recent polls have suggested the vote is swinging toward a Brexit, unsettling investors across the globe.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts said investors also look ahead to the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s two-day policy meeting due to conclude on Wednesday US Eastern time, after which Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen will hold a press conference. The </span><span class="s3">Bank of Japan</span><span class="s1"> (BoJ) will also meet Wednesday for a two-day meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“While there are no expectations for action from the Fed and the BoJ, their post-decision comments will still matter. In particular, the Fed's economic projections will be scrutinised,” said Bernard Aw, an analyst for </span><span class="s3">IG Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Besides these uncertainties, worries about the health of the Chinese economy also weighed on investor sentiment on Tuesday when David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's first deputy managing director, warned that China's corporate debt is “high and rising fast” and the problem should be addressed to avoid “serious problems”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As caution prevailed, trading volumes shrank on Tuesday in Chinese stock markets. Combined turnover for Shanghai and Shenzhen sharply decreased to 413 billion yuan from 589 billion in the previous session.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks were also volatile. The Hang Seng Index on Tuesday dropped 0.6 per cent or 125.46 points to close at 20,387.53, adding to a 2.5 per cent decline on Monday. The index has tumbled 3.1 per cent so far this week.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the currency markets, offshore yuan weakened against the US dollar to trade at 6.6037 as of 7pm Tuesday, down 0.11 per cent from the previous close. The currency fell the most in a month on Monday, approaching a five-year low, according to data from Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Global growth fears and Brexit concerns have rattled financial markets in the past few days, with investors fleeing riskier assets like equities and piling into safe-havens, such as the Japanese yen and gold.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Asian trade on Tuesday, the yen surged to its highest level against the euro in more than three years. Gold futures for August delivery slightly retreated, after settling at their highest level in five weeks on Monday night on safe-asset buying.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the meantime, the British pound fell 1.1 per cent to 149.98 yen as of 7pm Tuesday. The currency touched 149.48 yen on Monday, the lowest level since August 2013.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shanghai officials are confident the glitzy new exhibition hall currently taking shape will cement the city's status as the mainland's commercial hub - and prove Shanghai's determination to become one of the world's leading cities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But concerns of a possible oversupply of exhibition space have stoked fears that the stunning new complex will become a white elephant.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some critics also doubt whether a single complex can help overcome wider obstacles - such as a cumbersome tax system and questions over the rule of law and business culture.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The National Exhibition and Conference Centre, with it is 500,000 square metres of exhibition space, will give Shanghai yet another first. When it opens in October it will be the world's largest commercial complex for trade shows and business meetings. It's a new source of pride for officials who are convinced huge infrastructure projects will help rebrand the city.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shanghai regards the exhibition hall, located in the Hongqiao district, as a symbol of its rise as an international trading centre - the latest title the city is chasing, after transforming itself into a financial and shipping hub.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The final bill for the expo centre is expected to be 23 billion yuan (HK$29 billion), 30 per cent less than the Shanghai </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1"> amusement park slated to open next year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Indeed, the project carries significant political overtones for city leaders who have pledged to make Shanghai an international trading hub.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The city, recognised as a gateway to modern China, received the go-ahead from Beijing to develop itself into a global financial and shipping centre in 2009. The mainland leadership was trying to attract foreign capital and talent amid the global financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yu Zhengsheng , then Communist Party boss of Shanghai, said in 2009 that the city also aimed to become an international trading centre. But he told a government conference that to develop its financial centre, the city would have to convince policymakers in Beijing to fast-track liberalisation of the securities and monetary markets to attract capital inflow, which Shanghai made a priority in becoming a leading financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2011, Shanghai unveiled the centrepiece of its ambition to become an international hub of commerce, with a world-class exhibition hall to be built with central government support.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">City officials believed the complex would be a magnet for businesses from around the world, which would flock to glittering trade fairs. But spacious exhibition areas don't necessarily lead to more trade shows and exhibitors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shanghai has travelled this road before. The 30km maglev rail line, linking Pudong airport and Longyang Road, was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 2002.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But it has been eclipsed by the expanded metro system, with more passengers choosing the subway, where trips cost just a fifth of those by maglev.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Now, with the new national exhibition centre starting to bid for business, salesmen have admitted in private it was proving a tough job. The city already has 300,000 square metres of expo space at the New International Expo Centre.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hopes the complex may energise the wider economy may also be wide of the mark.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A flourishing marketplace is based on the rule of law, enforced intellectual property rights and a straightforward and reasonable taxation system, not just sleek exhibition space.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Fixed income funds have become the biggest winners this year, as investors shift their investments from equity funds to bond funds to escape rising market uncertainties, according to the latest figures from the Hong Kong investment fund industry's representative body.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Gross bond fund sales in the first eight months of this year stood at US$23.37 billion, more than double the income of equity funds (US$11.72 billion) during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Balanced fund sales, which invest in both equity and bonds funds, totalled US$66.96 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Arthur Bacci, the newly appointed chairman of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, which compiles the figures, said three economic uncertainties - China's economic slowdown, Britain's vote to leave the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">, and fear over a rise in US interest rates - have left Hong Kong investors worried.We have seen many investors shift from equity funds to fixed income funds this year due to those and other uncertainties hanging over the investment marketArthur Bacci, chairman, Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We have seen many investors shift from equity funds to fixed income funds this year due to those and other uncertainties hanging over the investment market,” Bacci said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“They are opting for lower risk investment options, and do not want to put too much money into equities.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“High-yield bond funds and mixed assets funds with bond exposure are proving popular,” he said, adding he expects the trend to continue for some months yet.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“There are still a lot of uncertainties ahead, as interest rates may rise in the fourth quarter. In addition, we do not know who will become the next US presidential in the coming election in November.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said the muddy economic waters have also led many to avoid making investments altogether, and so he expected overall fund sales to decline from last year.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Sales will be lower this year, however we firmly believe fund sales will return to growth, longer term.,” Bacci said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Bacci said the most positive aspect was the figures show investors are tending to shift their equity funds to bond funds, instead of simply redeeming them for cash.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Net capital inflow of funds - the deduction of redemptions from gross sales - however, still hit a record US$2.6 billion in the first eight months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">During the financial crisis of 2008, net outflow of funds was US$4.6 billion with redemptions bigger than total gross sales.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This year, we can still see positive net sales figures which shows investors are keeping their money in the mutual fund markets, although maybe changing their asset allocation from equity to bonds,” Bacci said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">British investment house </span><span class="s3">Schroders</span><span class="s1">' best-sellers this year are also bond funds: The </span><span class="s3">Schroder International Selection Fund</span><span class="s1">, Global Corporate Bond and Schrorder Asian Asset Income Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Its Hong Kong chief executive Chris Durack told the Post that if investors can afford to take higher risks, they should consider shifting into some equity or mixed asset funds to achieve higher long-term returns, as stock investment tends to win over bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Investors should pay attention to valuations of the stock markets when they decide to shift their investment from bonds to equities, as that could make a huge difference to their returns,” Durack said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We have been looking at global equity market returns over the last 40 years. Average annualised three-year returns over 40 years have been 17 per cent, when entry is made at 14 times price-to-earnings, compared with 3.7 per cent when investing at price-to-earnings of 24 times or above.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He warns, however, against investors switching funds too frequently.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The performance of the best-performing asset class over the last 20 years produced a return of 19.3 per cent per annum,” Durack said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“However, if investors were to chase this performance by investing in the same assets with a one-year lag, average returns fall to 2.3 per cent per annum.”</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mainland has eased rules to facilitate foreign direct investment in an effort to boost the ebbing capital inflow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Investment coming into the country has fallen in nine of the 10 months this year, official data showed this week, while outward investment continues to surge.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> yesterday said that from December 17, it would cancel the complex review procedures related to capital flows and currency exchange quotas of foreign enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">These companies will now only need to register their information with relevant departments, according to a statement posted on the regulator's website.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The simplified rules will encourage more foreign direct investment," said Standard Chartered Bank economist Li Wei. "However, it's yet to be seen whether the weakening FDI trend will reverse in the short term because it hinges more on the domestic and overseas economic situation."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Limitations on the use of foreign exchange funds would be eased too, the SAFE said, including allowing foreign-invested enterprises to extend loans to their overseas parents.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The regulator has also cut some technical procedures necessary for foreign investors in buying stakes in mainland firms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The current regulations have been in place since 1994, when Beijing unified a dual exchange rate system and replaced it with a "managed float".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Separately, the SAFE issued another statement yesterday, pledging to "closely monitor" the impact of changed market sentiment on the supply and demand of foreign exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It noted that capital market sentiment had "turned to optimism from excessive pessimism" towards the nation's economic and currency prospect, leading to "a bit stronger yuan exchange rate pattern".</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Global investors last month pulled out more than a quarter of their investments made earlier this year in US junk bonds and flocked to European bonds, yet maybe it's time for a rethink.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">High-yield, or "junk", bonds are those issued by companies of relatively low credit quality. Investors have earlier been shorting these bonds in the US based on expectations that they would lose their appeal in a rate hike cycle as better-quality bonds become more attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The recent shift in global capital flows has helped widen the gap between returns from the US and European high yield bonds, with the additional yield offered by the former hovering around 64 basis points, not far from the highest levels in the past 15 years, according to a report by Atish Suchak, a fixed-income investment manager at </span><span class="s3">Baring Asset Management</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">US high-yield bond funds have seen a combined net capital inflow of US$8.09 billion in the year to May 6, accounting for nearly half of the inflows to global high-yield bond funds, according to a report by Jefferies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, from April, investors have drawn a total of US$2.45 billion from the US high-yield space while during the same period, European high-yield bonds recorded a net inflow of US$1.21 billion, the report shows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Another noticeable number is the yield-to-worst, which measures the lowest yield available without the issuer defaulting. That now stands at 5.8 per cent for US high-yield bonds, compared with only 4 per cent for their European counterparts, says Suchak.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">According to Suchak, the default rates for US junk bonds will remain low as weaker oil prices and job growth acceleration should combine to increase consumer spending and support the US economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We believe there may be overlooked investment opportunities. Spreads on energy high-yield bonds are much higher than the rest of the high-yield universe and it is our belief that implied default rates priced in by the market, which stand at between 40 and 50 per cent, are overly pessimistic."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China is considering easing the 50 per cent ownership cap by overseas life insurers on domestic companies, in the biggest shakeup of the industry almost two decades since joining the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The government is considering letting foreigners own more than 51 per cent of life insurers, to the extent of allowing them to be wholly foreign-owned, Bloomberg reported earlier, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">If put into practise, the moves could boost the market shares of international insurance players that have operations in China, most of which are run under a joint venture structure, while some companies already some have self-owned branches.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Dayton Wang, an analyst with </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1">, said he could see the potential moves being made as China is keen to introduce foreign capital inflow by loosening shareholding structures, and introducing more overseas practises and experience to the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“However, it could still be hard for a foreign player to adapt to the Chinese financial environment, even if allowed to control a higher stake holding, as we have seen from what happened in the banking and brokerage sectors,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China has allowed foreign life companies to own up to 50 per cent in a joint venture in China since it entered the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1"> in 2000. But foreign players have complained that in some cases the shareholding structure deters the full development of operations.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Before then foreign insurance companies were approved on a case by case basis to operate in the China market, independently.It could still be hard for a foreign player to adapt to the Chinese financial environment, even if allowed to control a higher stake holding, as we have seen from what happened in the banking and brokerage sectorsDayton Wang, an analyst with </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji approved a branch of </span><span class="s3">American International Group</span><span class="s1">'s (</span><span class="s3">AIG</span><span class="s1">'s) life insurance unit to operate in Shanghai during his term as Shanghai mayor, with restrictions placed on product types and areas of business offered.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) </span><span class="s1">rejected an application by </span><span class="s3">AIG</span><span class="s1"> to transform its life insurance branch into a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2007. The group later restructured and gave birth to the </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“If this is true it will be good news,” said Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen, chairman of Asia region of US insurance and pension company Principal Financial Group.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">His firm has a joint venture fund management company with </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">, in which CCB owns a majority 65 per cent, Principal has 25 per cent and state-owned </span><span class="s3">China Huadian Corporation</span><span class="s1"> 10 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“China is already a major player in the global economy and such a move will signify the domestic economy is ready for more international competition,” Auyeung told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Furthermore, higher percentage ownerships will provide added confidence to foreign partners to introduce more advanced practises on product development, risk management and other internationally accepted procedures which effectively will benefit local customers and the industry.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mainland's hedge fund sector has received a shot in the arm with the establishment of a Sino-foreign joint venture between </span><span class="s3">Gottex Fund Management</span><span class="s1"> and VStone Asset Management, which is likely to open the floodgates for a huge capital inflow into upcoming domestic hedge fund managers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chen Jiwu, the president of VStone, a leading hedge fund manager on the mainland, told the South China Morning Post that the venture would manage assets worth several hundred million US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The joint venture is a measure of the confidence foreign institutions place in local hedge funds," Chen said. "It could help Chinese and foreign funds better understand each other."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Gottex, a Swiss fund-of-hedge-funds manager, has been looking to tap the mainland market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Sources said several other big global names, including Man Group, were also seeking opportunities to partner with domestic players to explore the share market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"I believe we are past the poor sentiment seen against China in the middle of this year," said Michele Gesualdi, a senior partner with </span><span class="s3">Kairos Investment Management</span><span class="s1">. "The more astute investors are in fact starting to appreciate that actually China, with more development on the capital market side, can offer plenty of stock-picking opportunities regardless of the macro environment."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland stocks are still off-limits for foreign investors but they are allowed to buy under the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme if they obtain a quota from the foreign-exchange regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing has set a total investment cap of US$80 billion for the scheme, of which about US$50 billion has been granted.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The presence of globally renowned players such as Gottex will also help hedge funds win the trust of investors here," said Chen.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing treads with caution when it comes to hedge funds as several outfits illegally raised funds from individuals to manipulate stocks in the 1990s. It was not until 2004 that hedge-fund-like structures, known as sunshine trust funds, were allowed on the mainland but they could be launched only through trust firms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There are now about 1,000 such funds on the mainland. One of the best performers is VStone, established in 2008 by Chen, a former chief investment officer at mutual fund house Fullgoal Fund Management and China Life Insurance, with US$1 billion of assets under management.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mutual funds still play a dominant role in the mainland's securities sector but Beijing is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of hedge funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The National People's Congress promulgated an amended law governing securities investment funds on June 1, giving experienced money managers greater freedom to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hundreds of experienced fund managers from the mainland's mutual fund companies have jumped ship to the hedge fund sector in the past years to chase higher returns and income.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Hedge funds are an indispensable part of institutional investment in the mature Western markets, and it's necessary to support their growth in the mainland market, too," said Howhow Zhang, the research head of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Local managers with good track records and reputation will grow fast in the coming years with increasing fund inflow from domestic and foreign investors."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing has taken a preliminary step towards liberalising the yuan capital account in the Shanghai free-trade zone, easing controls on foreign currency conversions for foreign direct investment (FDI) while attracting multinational companies to establish foreign exchange asset pools inside the zone.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But the measures fall well short of making the yuan convertible under the capital account, reflecting regulators' concerns about financial risks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Under the new operating guide issued by the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), overseas investors can park foreign currencies in advance in the free-trade zone before clarifying the use for the money as further direct investments on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Investors with bank accounts in the zone are also entitled to do conversions between yuan and foreign currencies whenever they want, a move to ease foreign-exchange regulations on FDI projects.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Currently, the mainland has a rigid approval procedure for foreign direct investments. FDI projects cannot be conducted unless investors receive approval from SAFE to exchange the foreign currencies into yuan before using them to set up production facilities or buy local assets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The investors are required to state clearly the use of the funds and the exact amount of investment into each of the FDI projects before going through the SAFE's review procedure.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The 60-page operating guide marks a milestone [in China's financial reform]," said Zhang Xin, the head of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> Shanghai branch. "It signals that the reform to make yuan convertible under the capital account has started."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Shanghai launched the free trade project in September as Premier Li Keqiang hoped to use the 28.78 square kilometre zone as a testing ground for economic reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing promised to make yuan fully convertible in the zone to facilitate cross-border fund flows and reinforce Shanghai's efforts to transform itself into an international financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A liberalised capital account would be of far-reaching significance to the mainland financial system and the national economy since it could result in free capital inflow to the property and manufacturing sectors as well as locally listed equities denominated in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The SAFE said the new policies would boost the real economy but again urged banks to strengthen risk controls to pave the way for further deregulation.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The credit risks faced by exporters are mounting even as trade data suggests a spike in mainland exports since the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Local manufacturers complain that it is taking much longer to collect bills as the appreciation of the yuan and rising costs add to the pressure on overseas buyers, especially those from Europe, who have increased the settlement period from one month to three months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Stanley Lau Chin-ho, vice-chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, said 40 per cent of his European customers, who make up around a third of his clientele, are demanding more time to settle their bills.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The cash flow is slowing as our products get more expensive due to yuan appreciation and as wages increase," Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"They help us shoulder a part of the appreciation, but in return they want extension on the payment period. Buyers from Europe are particularly more insistent on longer settlement periods."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A survey of more than 1,600 enterprises from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan found that overdue payments have increased for 42 per cent of Hong Kong enterprises and 56 per cent of mainland businesses, against 20 and 42 per cent respectively a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Nearly half the Hong Kong companies polled in the survey said payments overdue for more than six months made up more than 2 per cent of their annual turnover, a level considered dangerous for a company's cash flow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Richard Burton, chief executive of the Paris-based credit insurance company </span><span class="s3">Coface</span><span class="s1">, which conducted the survey, said that the situation was grim.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Although the Chinese government has been loosening the credit policy, most of the loans have gone to large companies or state enterprises. [Small and medium-sized enterprises] are increasingly turning to the informal credit system, which applies usurious rates. In the context of sluggish external demand, these SMEs, which account for 68 per cent of exports, could quickly find themselves in difficulty," Burton said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While mainland exports beat market expectation, growing 17.4 per cent over the first four months of this year, the Ministry of Commerce has told exporters not to be overly optimistic, as more than three-quarters of the enterprises it surveyed reported a drop in profit margins on the deals they signed since the beginning of this year and almost as many said they expected profit to stay flat or even fall.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland authorities are looking into charges of fraudulent inflation of trade figures. Analysts have questioned how mainland exports to Hong Kong in March could have jumped 93 per cent in an otherwise weak global economic environment. They say the US$197 billion of capital inflow into China in the first quarter could have been the result of exporters exaggerating shipments to bring cash into the country.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Brian Sun, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Exporters' Association, said that exporters have also been considering hedging against the yen: "Orders from Japanese clients fell sharply over the past month when the yen slumped to a 41/2-year low."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing is considering whether to expand the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme to attract more international capital into Chinese bonds and shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The official China Securities Journal quoted Yi Gang, head of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), the country's foreign exchange regulator, as saying that a plan to expand QFII quota was under review.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yao Gang, a vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told the Beijing-based newspaper that 80 per cent of the QFII quota had been issued.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Unlike Hong Kong, which puts no control on foreign capital flows into its markets, foreign institutional investors on the mainland can invest in stocks and bonds only under the QFII scheme, launched in 2003.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"I think it's part of the effort to accelerate the capital account liberalisation and open the domestic capital market to more foreign investors," said Joy Yang, chief economist for Greater China at Mirae Asset Securities in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Given the recent weakening in capital inflow, the timing (to expand the QFII programme) looks perfect," she added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mainland recorded net capital outflows for three consecutive months in the last quarter of 2011 and its foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, fell about US$21 billion to US$3.18 trillion, according to central bank data. Central bankers say there are signs that inflows turned positive this year, though slowly.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Many big names, including </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">, have been awarded QFII licences and quota to buy mainland stocks and bonds in the past decade. Some have already applied for renewal and increases of their quotas.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">More recently, South Korea's three state investment vehicles, including </span><span class="s3">Korea Investment Corp</span><span class="s1"> (KIC), a US$40 billion sovereign wealth fund, obtained a QFII licence and hired local brokers to help them begin investment, the South China Morning Post reported last month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The QFII scheme currently has a total quota of US$30 billion, and the central government has granted 129 QFII investors combined quotas of US$24.55 billion as of mid-March, according to official data.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The CSRC is only in charge of issuing QFII licences. Once a foreign institutional investor obtains a QFII licence, it needs to apply to SAFE for a QFII quota, which sets the amount that can be invested.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A huge jump in the quota for qualified overseas institutions to invest in mainland stocks and bonds was announced by Beijing yesterday, as it stepped up efforts to attract foreign capital.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The move, aimed at boosting liquidity on the mainland's weak stock market, reflected the new leadership's attempt to shore up investor confidence after the main stock market indicator lost 10 per cent this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> said the quota for the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme would be nearly doubled, to US$150 billion, from the current US$80 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Foreign investors are showing keen interest in the country's capital market," the CSRC said, and it would continue to attract long-term investors as a way to "reinforce the efforts to adjust the nation's economic restructuring and to upgrade the Chinese economy".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the same time, the securities regulator said the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor programme would be expanded to include Singapore and London as well as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing launched the QFII scheme in 2002, allowing institutions such as </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> to convert foreign currencies into yuan for investments in mainland-listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The RQFII programme, which allows select institutions to raise offshore yuan capital in Hong Kong to buy mainland stocks and bonds, was launched in 2011. Initially, only Hong Kong subsidiaries of mainland mutual fund firms and brokerages were eligible for raising RQFII funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of last year, Beijing increased the RQFII quota to 270 billion yuan (HK$341 billion) from 70 billion yuan and began enlisting the help of foreign institutions based in Hong Kong to direct offshore yuan capital inflow into the share markets. The CSRC did not say whether it would increase the RQFII quota.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Howhow Zhang, the head of research at fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, said: "Regulators are actively seeking overseas capital influx, but the interest among foreign institutions doesn't appear as strong as they expected."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The existing quotas for QFII and RQFII schemes have yet to be used up. The CSRC said US$43.5 billion of the QFII quota and 105 billion yuan of the RQFII quota had been taken up.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">QFII and RQFII investors now hold mainland stocks valued at only 1.6 per cent of mainland firms' total market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Wang Zhiwei, the chairman of GF Fund Management, said earlier that the response to RQFII funds was lukewarm in Hong Kong as investment returns were relatively low. The Shanghai Composite Index has been among the worst-performing indicators worldwide in the past three years.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The index fell 1.62 per cent yesterday, after a hefty 3.23 per cent jump on Thursday.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will launch a new stock trading system next month, as it upgrades the bourse infrastructure to handle rising volumes and turnover that is approaching HK$200 billion (US$25.5 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“It would be hard to predict if this daily turnover level will be the new normal,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, at the media lunch on Wednesday. “We are now back to the turnover seen in 2015, but we believe the current market situation is more sustainable than it was in 2015.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Even though turnover reached HK$198.9 billion on Tuesday, it is still some distance away from the record high of HK$293.9 billion achieved on April 9, 2015. The average daily turnover in the first three weeks of the 2018 stood at HK$152 billion, almost double the HK$88.2 billion in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The rising turnover comes as the benchmark Hang Seng Index continued to set new all-time highs last week, thanks to the capital inflow from mainlanders via the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock connect schemes. Mainlanders now represent between 6 to 10 per cent of daily market turnover in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Li said the record turnover in 2015 was driven by the rally of A-share market, which dropped substantially when the mainland's markets crashed in the summer of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He, however, expects the current trend of increasing turnover in Hong Kong will be sustained for a bit longer because the rally will last longer.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The new trading system will help to cope with the rising trading volume. The Orion Trading Platform can handle up to 60,000 transactions per second, twice that of the current system and has the capability to be expanded further.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The system will go live on February 5, replacing the AMS/3.8 system which has been in use for 17 years.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The turnover is expected to increase further as HKEX is in the process of launching its ever largest listing reform in three decades to allow large biotech companies with no revenue and giant dual class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong from June. The new measures are expected to attract more mega IPOs of technology and new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Completing the listing reform is one of our priorities in order to secure our relevance as a premier global capital formation centre,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We have already received some enquiries about listing under the new regime and we are targeting to complete the consultations regarding details on the rule changes by the end of this quarter.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The exchange started the upgrade of its trading infrastructure in 2012 and the introduction of Orion is the last stage of this programme that has led to the setting up of a world-class data centre among others.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Some tax incentives and relaxations on development should help the Hong Kong reit sector to capture the next wave of capital inflow from the world's largest real estate investors," said Victor Yeung, the chief investment officer at property management company Admiral Investment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">South China Morning Post, January 30</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Note those two words "tax incentives". They are critical to the debate about whether local real estate investment trusts should be forgiven taxes that others must pay. I draw your attention to them because, in the latest instalment of this debate, they were avoided by the Securities and Futures Commission in a consultation paper on reits.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"None of our business. Go talk to the financial secretary," said the SFC in wording that strongly hinted, "and we don't fancy your chances".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Quite right. The real debate is not about whether a ban on reit participation in development ventures should be lifted. Developers say it would make reits too risky (as if they really care), while the SFC is happy with the idea as long as the right boxes are ticked. But the real debate is about tax.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Let's take a step back here. Reits are an American idea to give small investors direct participation in rental income from big investment properties that are otherwise held outright by financial concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The key is that the reits pay little or no tax at the reit level so long as they pay out at least 90 per cent of their earnings in dividends. Uncle Sam then collects his toll lower down in the form of dividend, income, and capital gains taxes on the reit unit holder.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Reits have undoubtedly been very successful in the US, and countries with similar tax laws, in bringing the public into property investment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But then we come to Hong Kong. We do not levy dividend taxes or include dividends in personal taxable income and we do not levy capital gains tax. If we also forgave reits profit tax our government would derive no fiscal revenue at all from reits.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Fine, you may say, but the difficulty is that tax-paying property investment companies widely held by the public already have a sizeable presence in our stock market and there really is not much to distinguish them from reits. They may not pay out 90 per cent of their earnings as dividends but their shareholders mostly do not want big dividends. They have invested in a property firm because they value its skills in the business. Why then take out money when it is best left where it is?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In fact, the only thing that really distinguishes a reit from the likes of a Hongkong Land is that the reit gets an official piece of paper, which says, "You now have the right to call yourself a reit", leaving unsaid, "if that really cranks your crank. Can't see why."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Things would be different, of course, if reits were forgiven profits tax. But this would be monstrously unfair to existing property companies unless we accorded them equal treatment. And then the utilities would line up. Why not tax-free utilities too?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This obviously poses a conundrum to the stockbroker who wishes to sell Hong Kong reits to a foreign client. That client is dunned for profits tax in Hong Kong but then is also hit for personal taxes at home. There is no advantage to him at all in buying a Hong Kong reit.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It is one of the big reasons reits have never really taken off in Hong Kong. They offer nothing special. They are a tax dodge that doesn't dodge taxes here. They are devised to create an investment opportunity that has long existed here. In Hong Kong, they are pointless.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">So reit boosters now fall back on arguing either that we must have reits because they are a big thing in Singapore and Sydney, as if we really want the high-tax regimes of those places, or alternatively, that we will "capture the next wave" of investment inflow, as if this were a Somalia rather than a place that already has a surfeit of investment capital.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mainland's money supply last month expanded at its weakest pace ever, triggering sell-offs in the stock and money markets yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">M2, an indicator of money supply, grew 12.1 per cent at the end of March from a year earlier, the slowest year-on-year growth since monthly data was first reported in 1997 and well below the central bank's annual growth target of 13 per cent this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The slowdown in M2 reflects the still tight credit conditions as the economy is widely expected to have grown in the first quarter at the slowest pace in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">New yuan loans rose to 1.05 trillion yuan in March from 644.5 billion yuan in the previous month, reflecting a seasonal increase in lending. But the new loans were still 12.4 billion yuan lower than a year earlier. The weakness in money supply before the release of official economic data today sent the one-year rate swap to a one-month low. The Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.4 per cent, the biggest decline in five weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks fell the most in almost a month. The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.6 per cent to 22,671.26 points, erasing gains since plans for cross-border equity trading with Shanghai's exchange were announced April 10. All but three shares fell on the 50-member gauge. The H-share index dropped 2.1 per cent to 10,028.74 points.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Analysts, however, say credit may not be as tight as M2 growth indicates and that industrial demand may have picked up quietly, partly reflected in the fast rise of medium to long-term loans, which is likely to support an economic rebound as early as this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The M2 growth, distorted by a high comparison base a year earlier, has actually stayed within an expected range. A money supply rebound in the second quarter is almost certain, driven by demand in the real economy," Lu Zhengwei, the chief economist at Shanghai-based Industrial Bank, told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The easing in M2 comes after a 13.3 per cent rise at the end of February and a 15.7 per cent growth in March last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Sheng Songcheng, the head of the statistics department of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, predicts M2 to recover starting this quarter, with its annual growth seen to reach at least the 13 per cent target, according to local media reports. Last year, M2 expanded 13.6 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Total social financing, a broader gauge of credit supply, reached 5.6 trillion yuan (HK$7 trillion) in the first quarter, down 9.3 per cent from a year earlier, after regulators tightened the screws on shadow banking.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">According to a report by Caixin, the </span><span class="s3">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> rolled out a new guideline recently to tighten controls on trust companies, requiring them to build a mechanism to ensure liquidity and capital replenishment.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">New medium to long-term corporate loans, mostly used to finance infrastructure building, rose to 325 billion yuan last month from 291 billion yuan in February.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Corporate bond issues reached 252 billion yuan in March, also much higher than the monthly average of 66.4 billion yuan in the first two months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Some economists urged the central bank to take steps, such as cutting banks' reserve requirement ratio, to lower financing costs.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Nomura International</span><span class="s1"> chief China economist Zhang Zhiwei said local governments' financing platforms were issuing bonds at interest rates of more than 8 per cent, compared with the average of 5 per cent to 6 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The mainland's foreign-exchange reserves rose to US$3.95 trillion at the end of March, a gain of US$129 billion in three months.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Economists expect the yuan to face renewed appreciation pressures after the country recorded a trade surplus last month. But observers note capital inflow has slowed and a net outflow could be on the cards in the months ahead following the yuan's recent weakness.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">France's new pro-business-growth president is being seen as positive news for the Chinese currency, its manufacturers and exporters, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The result will also likely benefit the euro and European stock markets, as the new president supports France staying in the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">, while also wanting to see business growth — opposite views to his beaten opponent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Emmanuel Macron won France's presidential election on Sunday with a wide margin after gaining roughly 65 per cent of the vote, easily beating off far-right rival Marine Le Pen.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International, said the most important first consequence of the Macron's victory "is a known outcome that allows business as usual, and prevents negative political cross currents".</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The stability of the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> is most important as a Le Pen victory would have sent shock waves through the area and the world. Macron's victory cements the near-term stability of the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> thus helping to keep the euro at current levels and leave global foreign currency markets at ease," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While McGonegal said it is still far from sure that Macron's new policies can boost the flagging French economy, he believes the 39-year old new president should make an early visit to China a priority.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"One thing is for sure, if Macron wants to jump-start growth and increase French business prospects, he should get to Beijing as soon as possible and forge some joint business and trade initiatives," McGonegal said.One thing is for sure, if Macron wants to jump-start growth and increase French business prospects, he should get to Beijing as soon as possible and forge some Chinese and French business initiativesBrett McGonegal, chief executive, Capital Link International</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">If the French economy improves, however, he believes the steady flow of French workers flooding Hong Kong in recent years will slow as development picks up pace at home.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Over the past decade, the number of French in Hong Kong has doubled to 20,000, making it the largest French expat community in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The socialist system is broken and a new balance will be reached that should result in a stronger French economy and more emphasis on domestic growth thus quelling the overseas bleed," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner at accounting firm EY, also believes the youthful-looking new president will be looking to develop closer economic tie with China.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"China has some euro-denominated assets so to the extent that the Eurozone stays together, that is a plus for China and hence the renminbi," Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Macron's policy to support global trade is certainly seen as a plus for Chinese exporters to Europe, Pogson said, especially those distributing manufactured products.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at ANZ, said Europe is China's largest export market, representing a fifth of its total.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"A stabilised Europe should help maintain China's trade recovery and hence Hong Kong's re-export activities," Yeung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Besides exporters and manufacturers, the French election result is also seen to be factor supporting the euro's rising against the US dollar, and hence support for the yuan near term.A stabilised Europe should help sustain China's trade recovery and hence Hong Kong's re-export activitiesRaymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China, ANZ</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"In principle, the election result should help extend the recent dollar weakness and favour the yuan. However, recent concern on credit tightening will continue to weigh on the Chinese currency. We still expect it to trade against the US dollar at 7.10 yuan by the end of 2017," Yeung said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan fell 7 per cent against the US dollar last year and is now trading at around 6.90 yuan per US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda, however, believes the yuan could be weakened shorter term due to the most recent domestic economic data, but would not be affected much by the French election result.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The RMB is weaker due to the poorer-than-expected PMI service and manufacturing data," Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said France's policies are still met with a lot of uncertainty in some markets, but believes the result would lead to capital inflow to Europe and that would benefit undervalued banking stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer at insurer AIA Group, also believes in a positive market outlook, although he agrees uncertainties could lie ahead, given the legislative elections are still due in France next month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Generally Macron's election removes one of the critical uncertainties facing markets coming into 2017. This should allow European equities to continue their progress given their significant valuation discount to other global markets, including the US, and should be credit positive for France," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, said given the region's largest trading partner is the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1">, of course the election result is important.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Economic ties with Europe directly influence the region's growth potential, the ability of local corporates to access bank credit and, and the performance of Asia's currency, equity and bond markets," Wood said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Therefore it is no surprise that the receding political risk post the French elections will bring a sigh of relief for Asia's investors and policy-makers alike."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Money manager Fidelity International has delivered a vote of confidence for the mainland's technology stocks after global index provider MSCI decided to include A-shares in its emerging market benchmarks.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Raymond Ma Lei, a portfolio manager focusing on A-shares at </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1">, said the mainland stock market was filled with prospective companies that could generate handsome returns for overseas investors, spurred by the country's accelerated efforts to encourage technological innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“I feel confident, and enjoy investing in Chinese shares,” he told reporters at a media briefing on Thursday. “In terms of fundamentals, China's economy remains strong.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">MSCI said on Wednesday that it would add 222 A-share stocks to its benchmark emerging markets index, which will represent 0.7 per cent of the indicator's weighting.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The inclusion of A-shares in the benchmarks will technically direct a capital inflow to the mainland stock market as global funds track the indicators to allocate the assets under management.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's CSI 300 Index closes at 17-month high after MSCI inclusion[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2099442/hong-kong-stocks-tipped-rise-after-hang-seng-index-futures]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ma said </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1"> had already earmarked more than 0.7 per cent of its assets to buy A-shares, without disclosing the amount and details of its investment.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing is spearheading to transition the country's economic growth pattern as authorities encourage businesses to better use the latest information technologies to improve efficiency in manufacturing and commerce while cutting their reliance on massive fixed-asset investment and exports.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In China, E-commerce, financial technology (fintech), online payment and bike-sharing services have deeply penetrated people's daily life, which in turn would bolster consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ma said the huge collections of data sets that help accurately analyse consumers' demands and habits in China became a driving force for the booming internet-based businesses in the world's most populated market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Early this year, Stephen Dover, chief investment officer of Templeton Emerging Markets, said that some mainland-listed small-cap technology companies were good buys, but many global investors had missed the opportunities.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ma said that some of the small-cap A-shares that </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> bought earlier were offering attractive prices amid low valuations before their businesses grew on a fast track to bring investors lofty returns.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In January, </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1"> announced that its wholly-owned company in Shanghai became the first overseas player that could carry out hedge fund businesses in China's A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">FIL Investment Management (Shanghai) is allowed to raise funds from high-net-worth mainland individuals and institutions to directly trade A-shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There have been concerns among global investors about the mainland firms' lax management and misleading information disclosure.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Loosening capital controls would give mainland savers hooked on risky wealth management products a new option, but opening up too fast also entails unwanted risks, warn experts.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The regulator is worried about capital flight, but what's more worrying to economists is the increasing capital inflow," said Raymond Yeung, an economist at ANZ, who warned the stock connect scheme could lead to fresh pressures on the mainland's money supply.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">About 330 billion yuan (HK$416.7 billion) of shares in the Shanghai Composite Index changed hands yesterday, the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2005. That compares with about US$22 billion on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The stock connect scheme is a 'closed' channel, so offshore money cannot be moved out of the A-share market. But as share prices rise, people would be able to borrow more through securities-based loans, which will put pressure on the overall credit supply," said Yeung.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The implication of the stock connect scheme, which has an initial quota of 550 billion yuan, is seen to be huge for the mainland's financial system.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We see massive asset rebalancing in the long run after the rollout of the stock connect programme," said Patrick Wong, head of China sales and business development at </span><span class="s3">HSBC Securities</span><span class="s1"> Services.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Cross-border portfolio investment flow on the mainland is still substantially lower than that of its emerging-market peers, according to an </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> report released last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At the end of October, inward investment channelled through the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme totalled US$64 billion and that through the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor programme was 294.4 billion yuan. Outward investments through the qualified domestic institutional investor scheme came to US$87.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"I don't think China will get a 'take two' chance in opening up its capital account. They have to be very careful. Too fast is not good," said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Usually, when a nation wants a strong currency, it has either a fast-growing economy or inflation pressures. China has neither right now. It has low inflation and a weakening economy. So a strong currency might not be very helpful in the short term."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chandler warned a full opening of the capital account should take much longer than most market participants expected, citing the experience of the Soviet Union. Its financial system collapsed and inflation shot up when capital account controls were removed overnight in the late 1980s.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A continued stronger yuan against the US dollar should reduce the number of mainland investors still rushing to snap up Hong Kong stocks, to hedge against any future weakening in the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But it certainly won't stop the southbound capital flows still being experienced by the Hong Kong-Shanghai-Shenzhen Stock Connect trading system, top officials at </span><span class="s3">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> said in their latest regional market update on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The recent strengthening of the yuan and weakening of the dollar may slow the southbound capital flow, as mainlanders feel less of a need to hedge against a possible decline in the Chinese currency.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“But I don't think we will see any reverse in the tide of capital flow southward this year,” said Tai Hui, the investment giant's chief market strategist for Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Besides hedging [against] the yuan, mainlanders still like to invest in Hong Kong stocks to diversify their portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“There are limited investment choices in the mainland and there are increasing policies [being put] in place to discourage them from investing in property, while the fixed income market is complicated for retail investors,” said Hui.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is the most convenient market for them to invest. As such, I see southbound capital inflow to Hong Kong slowing a bit, but not dropping substantially.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan's 6.5 per cent weakening against the greenback in 2016 sparked many mainlanders to plough into Hong Kong stocks, property and insurance policies to hedge the risks, as the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mainland buying of Hong Kong stocks via the two Stock Connects with Hong Kong (Shanghai and Shenzhen) doubled last year, with their trading representing six per cent of total market turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan, however, rose to a four-month high on Tuesday to around 6.5 to the dollar, after gaining 6.8 per cent on its US rival over the full year - the biggest gain in nine years which wiped out the losses of 2016 and reversed three straight years of depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">And Hui believes the Chinese currency will continue to strengthen this year as Beijing strives towards its ultimate goal of gaining its full international use.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That expectation by Beijing inched ever close on Wednesday when Pakistan confirmed it is hoping to boost trade and economic ties with China, by trading with the country in yuan, the </span><span class="s3">State Bank of Pakistan</span><span class="s1"> in Karachi said. Imports, exports and financial transactions between the two countries can now be denominated in the yuan.Besides hedging [against] the yuan, mainlanders still like to invest in Hong Kong stocks to diversify their portfolio. There are limited investment choices in the mainland and there are increasing policies [being put] in place to discourage them from investing in propertyTai Hui, the investment giant's chief market strategist for Asia</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Regulatory frameworks such as the opening of letters of credit, clearing of transactions and financing facilities in yuan have been put in place, it said, adding the move has put the yuan on a par with other international currencies such as the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ayaz Ebrahim, co-head of the Asia Pacific regional team at </span><span class="s3">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span><span class="s1">, added the firm also holds a positive market outlook for Asia, particularly Hong Kong, China, India and South Korea, but that to expect some volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The market rallies in Asian stock markets in 2017 were supported by strong corporate earnings growth. We expect this to continue in 2018 across different sectors, with e-commerce in China and fintech development in India leading the growth trend,” Ebrahim said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, he believes H-shares - listed companies incorporated in mainland China that are traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange [A-shares refer to those listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen] - would continue to grow well, especially given the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">'s recent announcement of a pilot project on “full circulation” of selected H-share listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“H-shares are still the easiest way for international investors who want to invest in the China story as not all A-shares are allowed to be traded by international investors,” Ebrahim said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“As we are positive on the Chinese economic outlook, we are also positive on H-shares.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“What could go wrong, is if the US increases interest rates more aggressively than we expect. The Chinese government may also tighten regulation on shadow banking, which may slow the economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Regionally, Hui said wider Asian markets may be more volatile this year, predicting a worst-case scenario of a 15-17 per cent fall, compared with 4 per cent drop last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Investors should adopt a combination of styles to capture growth while maintaining downside protection,” he said, recommending they look at consumption, health care and technology stocks for growth, while buying high-dividend paying stocks for defensive approach.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The US interest rate rise on Thursday is likely to lead to increased capital outflow from Hong Kong and the mainland, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> increased the official base rate by 25 basis points to 1 per cent on Thursday, just hours after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> increased the benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a range between 0.50 per cent and 0.75 per cent - the first rate rise in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Under the peg link system which means the Hong Kong dollar tracks the US dollar, the city needs to synchronise with any US interest rate movement.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"With the US interest rates now rising, it's expected that some of the estimated US$130 billion of capital inflow into Hong Kong since 2008 will be exchanged back to the US dollar," said the HKMA's chief executive Norman Chan, during a press conference in Hong Kong today. "A capital outflow from Hong Kong is expected, and the Hong Kong dollar may trade at the weaker end of the peg at HK$7.85 per US dollar."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Capital Link International chief executive Brett McGonegal believes there will be two to three more rate rises next year, which will lead to a strong US dollar against other currencies, including the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The RMB will certainly be under more pressure from the strong dollar, but I'm not sure if we will see much more [movement] than we have seen recently," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">For Hong Kong overall, he believes the rate rise will be negative, however.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Money will become expensive, pushing property stocks lower and slowing transactions. I don't like the look of the Hong Kong market over the next year. A tightening Fed is the wrong prescription for the current chill Hong Kong is feeling," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at </span><span class="s3">Brown Brothers Harriman</span><span class="s1">, said the US interest rate rises will mean the greenback will continue to strengthen against the yuan, pushing the Chinese currency to as low as 7.20 yuan/dollar by the end of next year, down 4 per cent from the 6.90 current level.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Part of the outflow from China, especially the part that reflects the paying down of dollar debt, may continue," Chandler said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He said Beijing's recent moves of adding capital controls, however, could help minimise the outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Chinese government last month carried out a number of measures to control the outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They included a ban on mainlanders using credit cards to buy Hong Kong insurance products, and from the end of last month </span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> also limited bank lending to the equivalent of 30 per cent of an applicant's equity in an overseas firm in yuan.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Chinese currency has fallen 7 per cent against the US dollar this year, after a drop of 5 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The devaluation has led to a wave of capital outflow by both individuals and companies to buy stocks, insurance policies, and other overseas investment products and assets.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves fell more than expected in November, by US$69 billion to US$3.052 trillion compared with US$3.121 trillion in October, according to government statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It marked the largest monthly decline since January and was similar to the average monthly reduction of US$70.1 billion from August to January.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> report estimates that around 70 per cent of the drop was due to the falling value of the yuan against the dollar, following the US presidential election. Excluding valuation effects, foreign reserves still declined by US$21 billion in November, compared with a fall of US$9 billion in October, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, said Beijing is likely to add further controls next year to limit the outflow, and stop the rapid depreciation in the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Rather than allowing a significant exchange rate adjustment to deter the potential outflow, the authorities have sought a combination of exchange rate support and additional capital controls," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectiveness."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda, however, said the government measures would not halt the capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"With the US dollar expected to strengthen into the year end, the feedback loop will accelerate as the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> continues to burn through reserves to stem the tide.These conditions are likely to prevail as we go into 2017, although will fall short in terms of overall effectivenessMark Konyn, group chief investment officer at </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Moreover, I suspect the recent measures to curb loopholes in capital outflow will not turn the tide for depreciating yuan. These capital controls will likely accelerate in 2017," Innes said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ken Wong, Asia equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, said the interest rate rise would not only lead to capital outflow from China, but also from Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"If the Fed raises interest rates faster than market consensus of two rises in 2017, then there is no doubt Hong Kong could also see pressure with capital outflows," Wong said</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Just look at the 1-month HIBOR [Hong Kong interbank offer] rate, it's gone from 0.36 per cent before the US elections to now 0.62 per cent in a little over a month.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"With the unexpected strengthening of the US dollar and acceleration of interest rate rises in the US, capital could start to flow out of Hong Kong and that could have a major impact for its financial sector," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While Wong believes the yuan will face pressure, he considers worries surrounding a significant RMB devaluation have probably been overdone.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The Chinese authorities seem to be pursuing currency and market policies that promote stability. The RMB is now included in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights and given China's economy is still able to maintain over 6 per cent GDP growth, long-term investors in China shouldn't have too much to fear about significant RMB weakness," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Edmund Yun, head of investment solutions at CIC Investor Services, believes there will be three more rate hikes next year, but that the next won't be until June.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Although the RMB has continued its weakening trend against the US dollar following the US election, it has in fact appreciated against the euro and the Japanese yen, as recent economic data from China has shown there are some improvement in economic growth," Yun said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Looking forward, we believe the RMB will probably continue to weaken against the US dollar but on a more gradual basis, probably in line with other major currencies such as the euro or yen. We may see RMB to surpass 7.0 to the dollar within 2017," Yun said.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its key interest rate for the first time in a year, and foreshadowed three additional moves in 2017, officially ending almost a decade of loose monetary policy that has flooded the world's capital markets with cheap money and bolstered asset prices.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Fed increased its key rate by 25 basis point to a target range of between 0.5 and 0.75 per cent, the first increase since December 2015. </span><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> followed the Fed's move with a 25 basis point increase in its base rate to 1 per cent, to preserve the city's currency peg with the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While the US move had been well telegraphed and much delayed, Fed chair Janet Yellen signalled that the American economy is strong enough to withstand more increases next year, in a policy stance that's more aggressive than the market anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Most Asian equity markets declined after the Fed's move. Shanghai's Composite Index fell 0.7 per cent, while the CSI 300 index fell 1.1 per cent. The yuan weakened to an eight-year low of 6.9505 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China's bond market saw a record sell-off on Thursday morning with benchmark 10-year treasury futures March delivery closed 1.81 per cent lower, the biggest drop since resumed trading three years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index fell 1.8 per cent to a four-month low of 22,059.40 after the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> followed the Fed's 25 basis point move. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 2.3 per cent to 9,479.16.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">With more interest rate increases in 2017, capital could flow out of Hong Kong, causing ripples to the city's economy, said Norman Chan, chief executive of the city's de facto central bank, during a press conference.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“With the US interest rates now rising, it's expected that some of the estimated US$130 billion of capital inflow into Hong Kong since 2008 will be exchanged back to the US dollar,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A series of further interest rate increases will spell the end of negative real rates in Hong Kong, which may cause real estate prices to plummet, property agents and analysts said. Meanwhile, higher interest rates may spill over to increased mortgage rates, which will pile on the financing burden for home buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Interest rate is only one factor that affects the property market,” Chan said. “There are other reasons for people to decide when to buy or sell their properties.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's commercial banks have yet to raise their rates. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">, Dah Sing Bank and the </span><span class="s3">Bank of East Asia</span><span class="s1"> all announced they would leave their deposit and loan rates unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, a number of markets including bonds, stocks, property and foreign exchange are likely to be affected by the move, said EY's Asia-Pacific senior partner of financial services Keith Pogson, who expects as many as six relatively small increases of US interest rates over a period of time.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We may see regional currency volatility, but in the long run this is to some part at least priced in and will level out over time,” Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Further interest rate increases next year will lead to mixed fortunes for world currencies, said the Hang Seng Bank's executive director Andrew Fung, who expects three to four rate increases in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“This will support a strong US dollar,” Fung said. “The yuan will weaken along with the yen and the euro.”</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Offshore loans secured by domestic guarantee can be repatriated to China to facilitate domestic companies' cross-border financing and investment, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> said in a statement posted on its website[http://www.safe.gov.cn/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gPZxdnX293QwML7zALA09P02Bnr1BvI2c_E_1wkA6zeGd3Rw8Tcx8DAwsTdwMDTxMnfz8P50BDA09jiLwBDuBooO_nkZ-bql-QnZ3m6KioCACk6Xh-/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfSENEQ01LRzEwODRJQzBJSUpRRUpKSDEySTI!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/safe_web_store/safe_web/zcfg/zhfg/qt/node_zcfg_qt_store/06ad61004fd6d8b2b8d6b88c78fc6d27] on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The new steps, posted on the last working day ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday on the mainland, reflect Beijing's efforts to better balance capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Offshore loans secured by domestic guarantee have been used in the past to encourage domestic companies to invest offshore. Allowing the capital to be repatriated means Beijing is encouraging the flow the other way around, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The nation's forex regulator also granted more leeway for multinational companies to make use of offshore foreign exchange for onshore use. Multinationals are allowed to tap 100 per cent of the offshore foreign currency deposits for domestic operation, up from a cap of 50 per cent previously.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The foreign exchange regulator also clarified that domestic companies have to make up for their previous losses before they can transfer the current year's profits offshore, adding figures than US$50,000 must be vetted with supporting documents.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The forex regulator said such measures aim to “deepen foreign exchange management reform, cut red tape, support the growth of real economy and facilitate trade and investment.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ren Zhiyi, a partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Fangda Partners</span><span class="s1">, said the measures indicate policymakers are seeking to ramp up capital inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“It's not surprising to see more measures expanding capital inflow as Beijing is trying various means to attract more capital back home to counter mounting capital outflow amid expectations of a weaker yuan,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan lost nearly 7 per cent in 2016, or its biggest annual loss against the US dollar since 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China has tightened its capital controls in the past year though it reiterated its unwavering support on “real and reasonable” overseas investments.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yuan ends 2016 with biggest annual loss since 1994[http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2058260/yuan-ends-2016-biggest-annual-loss-1994]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The outflow curbs include vetting on cross-border payments exceeding US$5 million meant for overseas investment purposes, enhanced scrutiny on large-scale overseas investment and limiting the amount of yuan that Chinese companies can remit outside the country through overseas lending, sources said earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said China's moves to tighten capital controls are seeing some success.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Outflows last month were the smallest since August thanks to a sharp pull-back in outbound direct investment,” he said in a note. “Policymakers aren't out of the woods though: a period of further US dollar strength could trigger another rise in outflows.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He estimated that December outflows amounted to US$60 billion, down from US$74 billion in November.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Banks in Hong Kong are divided on the prospect of the yuan appreciating and are offering wildly different interest rates, with the outlook for the currency clouded by the liquidity crunch on the mainland and a slowing economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">While </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and Citibank are willing to pay an annual interest rate of just 0.6 per cent to attract six-month yuan deposits, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> (Asia) on Monday offered up to 5.2 per cent to new customers for fresh deposits.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China Citic Bank International, which has been active in attracting yuan deposits, also on Monday announced it would pay new customers 3 per cent interest for three-month deposits. The same day, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> cut the rate for three-month yuan deposits to 2.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan has been the only Asian currency to have appreciated against the US dollar so far this year, growing at an unexpectedly fast pace of 1.7 per cent. Yet the deposit rates that many banks are offering are still far higher than that figure.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Lots of Chinese banks, such as </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">, may have been affected by the credit crunch on the mainland and are keen to replenish their capital base," said Liu Ligang, an economist at </span><span class="s3">Australia and New Zealand Banking Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Some Chinese lenders are willing to pay high deposit rates here also because they can lend the capital at even higher rates on the mainland. But foreign banks are being more conservative."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong banks also possibly saw a different valuation path for the currency in the second half, said market watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">China Citic Bank economist Liao Qun said he expected the yuan to appreciate up to 2.5 per cent against the greenback this year, banking on Beijing's efforts to boost cross-border loans that he believes would support the demand for the currency even as exports slump.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> economist Qu Hongbin expects the yuan to gain by less than 2 per cent for the whole of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The slow appreciation of the yuan we have seen in the first half is hard to continue for the rest of the year as the capital inflow to the region has been reversed recently in response to a strengthening dollar," Qu said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">CICC, a mainland investment bank, said the appreciation trend of the yuan was poised to reverse in the second half, after exports and imports both dropped last month as the country's growth momentum appeared to slow.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The economy grew 7.5 per cent in the second quarter from the same period last year, compared with 7.7 per cent growth in the January-March period, new data showed on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The yuan's value against the US dollar might drop 1 per cent, after exports in June fell to the worst level since October 2009, said CICC chief economist Peng Wensheng.</span></p>
