<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange needs to introduce additional measures to protect minority shareholder rights if it allows the listing of shares with unequal voting rights, including putting a time limit on them, Norway's sovereign wealth fund argues.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The exchange proposed in December to introduce dual-class shares, which typically give one set of shareholders greater voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A number of Chinese tech groups are considering where to list their shares in 2018. And unequal voting structures are favored by technology companies as a protection against shareholder pressure for short-term returns.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The influential Norwegian government pension fund - the world's largest with assets of US$1 trillion (HK$7.78 trillion) - wrote to the Hong Kong exchange to say that while it supports measures to motivate companies to go public it was concerned about the impact on minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We regard the protection of minority shareholder rights as a necessary requirement to safeguard and promote the fund's long-term financial interests," it said. "To maintain market standards for investor protection we see the need for additional measures."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">One measure should be a time-based phase-out of unequal voting rights, and another should be to strengthen standards governing the independence of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Unequal voting structures have been criticized by corporate governance advocates, who warn of potential abuse by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Certain matters, such as transactions involving entities associated with holders of weighted voting rights, should always be subject to the "one share one vote" principle, the fund said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, also known as the oil fund and one of the world's largest investors, said it had US$26.6 billion invested in shares listed in Hong Kong at the end of 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">HK revamps listing rules in battle for global tech giants -- SCMP headline, December 16</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This latest attempt by Hong Kong's stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to destroy shareholder democracy has an offhand way of dismissing his earlier, overly ambitious attempt to do away with all significant listing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That earlier concept paper in 2015 was only a “straw man”, says this latest concept paper; meaning, I take it, that it was an intentionally false proposal we were meant to knock down, so as to make it easier to introduce the real one.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Oh, thank you, Charles. So kind of you to waste our time. How very thoughtful of you.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But the real one (let's hope it's not just another straw man this time) does have one brand new idea: it is to allow listing by “pre-revenue” biotech companies, as long as they have a “minimum expected market capitalisation” of HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million).</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">I shall ask the obvious question for you: If they are not yet selling anything, leave alone turning any profit, on what basis can the market be “expected” to value them?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Perhaps we could try the old Roman way of dealing with such eventualities. Take a live chicken, cut it open on the spot and then call in a soothsayer to tell you what the entrails forecast. It worked for the Romans apparently.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The new concept paper's version of this idea is to say there “tends to be” strict regulation of activities undertaken by biotech companies, and this should be enough. If it's good enough to swallow, then it's worth at least HK$1.5 billion, you see.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We had an example of such tends-to-be strict regulation only last week, when a doctor at a beauty shop was convicted of manslaughter by administering untested biotech quack remedies. It's a big industry. Just look at its tsunami of advertisements.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Let's face it. This town has a weakness for biobabble. Talk a fast line in biotech and the customers will always line up. No one understands a word of it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">And then we get Charles back to his one-track mindset of WVR, or weighted voting rights. Our principle of “One Share, One Vote” is to be abandoned for “new economy” companies. All shareholders are equal, but some will be more equal than others.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong can now join the international race for the bottom in listing standards, while the cash-out price of Charles' share options - remember that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd</span><span class="s1"> is a listed company, whose shares are trading near a record - can race for the top.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But I mustn't spread falsehoods. It is not true that ordinary shareholders will be deprived of all voting rights in WVR companies. As long as their votes don't matter, they can have a few. Maybe they can butter them and have them for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">And again, of course, we get no definition of what the “new economy” is. It is “hard to define”, “not necessarily restricted to specific sectors”, “likely to evolve over time” and “the Exchange proposes to publish a guidance letter”.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Any investment banker can find his way round such non-restrictions. WVR will therefore apply to the entire market from now on.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The oddity here is that recent events have made nonsense of the supposed purpose of attracting more technology listings. They have come anyway. There has been a flood of them over the last few months, as high tech, and devoid of earnings, as any mindless follower of investment fashion could want.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It is also worth noting that WVR does not really make a stock more attractive to the professionals. In the US, for instance, both the S&amp;P and the MSCI indices have recently announced they will not accept shares with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This matters. The MSCI indices in particular are benchmarks for institutional investors. To have your stock included in any of them is to attract big time investor interest. To be permanently excluded because of your share structure now constitutes a self-induced banishment to second class.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">So why do it?</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There must be some legitimate reason. I cannot imagine that every corporate chieftain who asks for a WVR listing does it only because he wants to have his cake and eat it too, and is happy to rob his shareholders in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As I say, there must be a defensible reason. But don't ask me what it is.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">London's multiple-market structure enables companies ranging from innovative start-ups to mature, established firms to raise funds, according to London Stock Exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He declined to comment on whether listing reforms in Hong Kong - which might include introducing additional boards with different listing requirements - could help attract more e-commerce and technology companies to list their shares there.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">But he did say that in his experience it was advantageous to offer several different markets catering for a broader range of prospective companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"I can only share our experience that shows it would be better to have different markets to meet the different needs of companies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> agrees with the Hong Kong stock exchange principle of "one share, one vote", which prevents companies with a dual-class structure from floating their shares, because it is fair to investors, said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">However, he said he understands why some e-commerce founders might be against it because they want to maintain control of their company despite holding a minority stake. In a dual-share listing, the stocks carry unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> allows firms with this dual-share structure to list on its High Growth Market, which is in between the AIM, the standard market and premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The four markets have different [listing] requirements and can meet the needs of different types of companies," said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is currently consulting the market on listing reforms which propose to set up two separate committees - a listing policy committee to set policies and a listing regulatory committee to approve complicated listing applications. The latest consultation period ends this Friday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Calls for reform came after e-commerce giant Alibaba chose New York over Hong Kong for its US$25 billion IPO two years ago because the former allows dual-share listings. The structure has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s because it is seen as breaching the long-held "one share, one vote" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Regulators refused Alibaba's request for exemption from the rule, which would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate a majority of the board. Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ma earlier this month criticised the Hong Kong listing rule, saying it is outdated and cannot match the needs of a modern economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Rolet said the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is aware of many start-ups and private companies that want to raise funds but are not yet qualified to list.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The bourse has thus set up a programme called ELITE which allows such companies to undergo 18 months of support and mentorship to prepare them for a listing. Senior executives participate in a number of workshops aimed at helping them review and change their business model.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">When they are ready, the companies can try to raise funds through investors or apply to list on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We have had 450 companies in 27 countries in Europe, America and Africa [on the programme]," said Rolet. "We are considering bringing it to Asia where there are many high growth companies."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Our youngest participant company in the ELITE programme is just seven months old, and the oldest one is a 700-year old wine making company. Some are start-ups while some of them are family-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"There is no guarantee that these companies will succeed and some of them may collapse. But on average, these companies go on to have an annual growth rate of 60 per cent."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will continue to rank top globally for initial public offerings in 2017, with 130 companies raising up to HK$220 billion, according to accounting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The estimate, published on Tuesday, is 13 per cent higher than last year's total and would represent a turnaround after 2016 saw funds raised from IPO plunge 26 per cent from the previous year. Despite the drop, Hong Kong retained the No.1 spot for a second consecutive year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Eddie Wong, a partner at PwC Hong Kong's capital markets services, said the estimate did not include several potential mega IPOs of payment service providers and ‘new economy' firms as their listing timetables and venues have not yet fixed. He did not identify these companies but brokers said </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s peer-to-peer lending arm Lufax and Alibaba's online payment company Alipay were likely to launch IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“If these mega technology companies would decide to list in Hong Kong this year, the IPO funds raised would be much higher,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Only 3 per cent of funds raised from IPO in Hong Kong last year were by technology firms, compared to 69 per cent by financial firms. Wong said that trend will continue this year and called for a new board for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“There is a need to launch a new board traded by professional investors. If the new market is not traded by retail investors, the rules can be more flexible to meet the needs of start-ups or mega technology firms to list in Hong Kong,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">' founder Jack Ma said in November that Hong Kong must reform its listing rules to attract new-economy businesses, and said he would only list Alipay in Hong Kong if the city was ready. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alibaba chose to list its shares in New York in 2014, in a world record-breaking US$25 billion IPO. The choice of New York followed Hong Kong's refusal to allow dual-share listings, a structure incorporating shares with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">PwC is also positive about IPOs in the A-shares markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. It expects the two bourses to raise a combined 220 billion to 250 billion yuan in 2017, up 51 per cent to 66 per cent from HK$167.8 billion last year, which was low because China had suspended IPOs for some months.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, Ricky Chim Kim-lun and Gordon Tsui Luen-on will compete for 622 votes in a four-year term to represent Hong Kong's financial services industry in the Legislative Council. Eligible voters are stockbrokers, futures and gold traders.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They are all calling for reforms to change the Hong Kong market's dominance by financial services and property companies, to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">They are also calling for measures to reboot the broking industry, and help the smallest brokers survive.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A week before the September 4 election, the three candidates speak to the South China Morning Post about their thoughts on listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Cheung, 64, the incumbent lawmaker who's seeking re-election, said Hong Kong needs a new board with flexible listing rules to attract technology companies to raise funds here.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), launched in 1999 to attract technology firms, was a failure," he said. "We need a new board with listing rules that are more relaxed than the main board and GEM."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its top spot as the world's largest IPO market in 2014 when Alibaba moved its record US$25 billion public offer to New York. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bars publicly traded companies with a dual shareholding structure, or shares that give shareholders unequal voting rights. That's compelled many technology companies to look instead to the US to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Only 22 of the 343 companies, or 6 per cent of the total, listed in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013 were technology related, Cheung said. Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"If Hong Kong can find a way for dual-class structure that protects investors, I would support it," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government should work with Chinese regulators to let local brokers sign on new clients on the mainland, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a small market with a population of only 7 million," he said. "If Hong Kong brokers can go north to open accounts for clients on the mainland, it would be very helpful."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Tsui, 56, a former banker who joined the securities industry in 2000, is now managing director of Hantec Group International Finance.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Like Cheung, he wants Hong Kong to implement a third board with a different set of listing rules to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs a new board with different regulations from the main board and the GEM to meet the needs of technology companies," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ricky Chim Kim Lun</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chim, 47, is a veteran of the financial industry of two decades, and a director of several listed companies. His seat was formerly held by his father Chim Pui-chung.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should follow US regulations to attract a wide range of companies to list here, not just IT firms, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"We want companies in all industries and all sizes to list here to make it a diversified market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chim is also opposed to letting the SFC decide on what companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong does not need a new board," Chim said. "Hong Kong should adopt a disclosure based regulatory regime that allows companies to list as long as the disclosed information meets the SFC's standards. If the US can do it, so can Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Even if public companies offer shares with different voting rights, they should still be allowed to raise funds in Hong Kong, and it's up to investors to decide it they want to accept these unequal rights, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's broking industry is dominated by 14 of the so-called Category A brokers owned by large banks, now with 56.2 per cent share of daily transactions, up from 28 per cent in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The middle market, comprising 51 Category B brokers, keep a market share of about 33.4 per cent of trading every day.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The bottom of the market, with 435 small brokers in Category C, now make up 10.4 per cent of turnover, shrinking from 40 per cent market share from their heyday in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The smallest brokers have been unfairly treated by the regulator and the government, Chim said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"Many government policies don't benefit the small players, and may gradually force them out of business," he said. "There should be more policies in place to help the small brokers compete with the big players."</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">On Hong Kong's proposed listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">All three candidates object to the listing reforms proposed in June by the HKEX and the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Under the proposal, two new committees will be established with equal number of representatives from the HKEX and the SFC to set policies for listing companies on the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That's too much power in the hands of the SFC, according to all three candidates. The proposal would be of little help to increase the Hong Kong bourse's competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As many as 95 per cent of all the local brokers he'd met are all opposed to the proposed reforms, Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The proposed listing reform would only complicate the listing process and lengthen the time for the approval, " he said. "It would not speed up the process. If the SFC insists on going ahead with the reform, it's going to kill off the market here and add further damage to the low market turnover."</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's three-year run of growth in the city's listings market will switch into reverse gear next year, reports say, as deal sizes get smaller.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Professional services firms EY and KPMG forecast that Hong Kong's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market will raise HK$200 billion from up to 120 companies next year, against about HK$225 billion in 109 deals this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The projected smaller scale of the initial public offerings reflects that most of the mainland's state-owned enterprises have listed over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The reports may give ammunition to those market participants wanting to see an end to the city's ban on controversial dual-class share structures. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is conducting a consultation on whether to amend its listing rules to accommodate structures that give shareholders the same financial benefits but with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The consultation was prompted by mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's move to bypass Hong Kong for New York, where exchange officials agreed to allow its senior managers to have greater voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the global IPO rankings for 2014, Hong Kong ranked second after the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which hosted Alibaba's record-breaking US$25 billion sale.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO market has never returned to the heights seen in 2010, when it raised a record HK$449 billion from 101 listings in 2010, thanks to </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$22 billion dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Capital in Asia will return to the US markets once the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> starts to raise interest rates, Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY, said in a briefing on the report yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Choi believes that Beijing is considering loosening its grip on the full circulation of H-shares, which should translate into higher trading volumes as the overhang of non-tradeable shares is removed.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">"The [full-circulation of H-shares] scheme, if fully implemented, should attract more institutional investors to invest in mainland companies listed in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> is reviewing the full circulation of locked-up Hong Kong shares, with relevant documents to be released next year, EY said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Beijing's approval for such a move means that restricted shares issued by a mainland company can be traded in full outside the mainland and denominated in foreign currencies, such as the Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In 2005, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> was given special permission from Beijing to list with this arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at KPMG, said financial firms would be the major IPO driver next year, reflecting their need to meet tougher capital requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange said it will explore ways to encourage start-ups and technology companies to raise capital in the city, conceding the need to tweak existing listing rules to compete with Singapore and New York to be the hub for initial stock offers.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388%20&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], at a luncheon with more than 100 of the city's brokers and fund managers.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">On Monday, the listing advisory committee at rival </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> approved a plan to allow companies with dual-class shares to raise funds, in a move that makes the city more appealing to technology start-ups that often feature stocks with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Dual-class structure has been the subject of intense debate in Hong Kong since the bourse in 2014 missed out on a US$25 billion initial public offer by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alibaba has a dual-class structure that allows founding shareholders to nominate up to half the company's board of directors even as they own minority shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong hasn't allowed such a structure since the 1980s because the city's Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the market regulator, believes dual-class shares violate the “one share, one vote” principle and are unfair to other investors.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alibaba eventually listed its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The US stock market allows dual-class shares, favoured by technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">LinkedIn</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the world's largest destination for IPOs from 2009 to 2011, but lost that pole position to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2014, due to Alibaba's listing.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In addressing the annual gathering of stockbrokers, Li neither specifically addressed the subject of allowing dual-class structure in Hong Kong, nor bring up competition with Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“We have our own plan and our own strategies and we will explore all possibilities,” he said. “Other stock exchanges do their own thing and we will not respond to what another exchange is doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At stake for Hong Kong could be another large stock offer by other startups including Alibaba's online payments unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, which investment bankers estimate could be valued as much as US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Alibaba's founder Ma told the University of Macau students in June that he “very much hopes” to list </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which operates the Alipay electronic payments platform, in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Hong Kong financial secretary John Tsang Chun-wah in his budget has unveiled a multibillion dollar plan to turn the city into a technology hub to nurture the development of companies including those involved in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The local listing rule however are not tailored for start-ups or technology firms to raise capital in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s1">There are Barbarians knocking on Chinese boardroom doors right across the country, and more are likely to follow, say analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The list of Chinese companies - mainly A-share listed, mid-caps with industry competitiveness - becoming embroiled in hostile takeover battles is growing by the day, which experts are now suggesting may start to put undue pressure on the real economy.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Taking centre stage, of course, is the ongoing battle royale for </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1">, the country's former biggest property developer.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Not only has China's biggest homebuilder been fighting off the unwanted attentions of its two largest shareholders in recent months - the little-known insurance firm </span><span class="s3">Baoneng Group</span><span class="s1"> which owns 25.4 per cent of Vanke, and state-owned investment conglomerate </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> which holds 15.3 per cent - it is now having to contend with industry peer </span><span class="s3">China Evergrande Group</span><span class="s1">, which lifted its own stake in the business to 14 per cent on Tuesday, after splashing out more than 12 billion yuan acquiring more shares.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Vanke's founder Wang Shi last year described Baoneng directly as “barbarians” after the insurer built its stake - but its officials are yet to find a seat at the Vanke boardroom table.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Zheng Zhigang, a professor of finance with Renmin University, is calling the Vanke saga a “landmark” for China's capital markets, and is certain other similar aggressive takeover tussles are likely to ensue in the coming months.Intrusions by such ‘barbarians' will become a new normal phenomenon, as many Chinese companies have dispersed shareholdingsZheng Zhigang, professor of finance, Renmin University</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Intrusions by such ‘barbarians' will become a new normal phenomenon, as many Chinese companies have dispersed shareholdings.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“There are more than 100 companies listed on A-share market without controlling shareholders, and these are likely to become the obvious first targets,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“The market is full of opportunists such as Baoneng, but it just so happens Wang Shi was the first to feel its unwanted attentions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“If a capital market is unable to impose thresholds to prevent such barbarian activity, the innovative ability and the efficiency of the whole society will be at stake, with the net result a negative effect on the real economy,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">In the past fortnight, several companies have seen new shareholders increase their holdings, with the aim of gaining a seat on their boards or even full control.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The latest example came on Thursday last week, when Shanghai-listed China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC), one of the world's largest builders, said in a filing that </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1"> had bought 3 billion of its shares in a week, to became its second biggest shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Anbang bought its first 1.5 billion shares the week before. CSCEC said in a statement it “welcomed Anbang as a major investor”.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The day before, meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">Gree Electric Appliances</span><span class="s1">, China's largest air conditioner manufacturer, hit its daily upward limit on the Shenzhen bourse and a 16 month-high share price, triggering market speculation that the capital strong Baoneng was building up a stake in the company.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Gree</span><span class="s1"> said Baoneng had become its third biggest shareholder with 4.13 per cent stake. Baoneng bought the shares between Nov 17 to 28, according to the filing.Insurance companies have become major acquirers, as many of them are being motivated to seek higher returns after issuance of large amounts of universal insurance products promising high yieldsChen Jie, chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">GF Securities</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">And on November 16, seven senior managers, including chairman and CEO of CSG Holdings, a top glass manufacturer listed in Shenzhen, resigned from their positions, after market rumours circulated they had conflict with its new biggest shareholder - none other than Baoneng.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Executives from Baoneng-controlled Foresea Life Insurance have since taken over from the departed </span><span class="s3">CSG</span><span class="s1"> executives, the latest filing of the company shows.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“I don't think the bloodshed in </span><span class="s3">CSG</span><span class="s1">'s boardroom is a favourable result for any party, because Baoneng is a top player on the capital market, but not within that industry.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Faced with this new challenge of capital invasion, we should consider how to improve corporate governance,” Zheng said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Issuing unequal voting shares, or the dual-class stock structure adopted by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which guarantees the founders control and power over the company's operation, could be a solution followed by others, he added.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Chen Jie, chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">GF Securities</span><span class="s1">, says companies with mid-tier market values, high returns on equity, high dividends, while maintaining low valuations and dispersed shareholding structure, were the most likely to be targeted by capital-strong outsiders.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Insurance companies have become major acquirers, as many of them are being motivated to seek higher returns after issuance of large amounts of universal insurance products promising high yields.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“Equity investment took up 14.25 per cent of the total investable assets of China's insurance companies by the end of the third quarter. And that's a long way from the 30 per cent cap set by the insurance regulator,” he said, noting purchase of listed shares by insurance companies would accelerate in the last quarter of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">He Fan, chief economist at the Chongyang Institute of Finance, within Renmin University, said what is happening could have implications on the “internet economy”, which is currently booming in China.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">“During the early days of development by internet start-ups, brains were much more important than capital. However, as the industry evolves and big data becomes the main focus for the bigger players, capital now speaks louder,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">CSG Holdings</span><span class="s1">' annual report in 2014 showed it had a dispersed shareholding structure, with the top shareholder owning just 3.62 per cent stake, while the top three shareholders owns a mere 9.21 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Baoneng started to accumulate its shareholding in the company at the end of 2014, and by the end of September it had become its largest shareholder with a 25.77 per cent stake, and a place in the boardroom.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">This June, Baoneng requested an extraordinary shareholder meeting to oust the </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1"> board, including founder and chairman Wang Shi - but its request was rejected by the directors</span></p>
