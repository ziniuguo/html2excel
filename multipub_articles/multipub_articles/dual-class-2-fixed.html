<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Ceajer Chan Ka-keung said yesterday that the new board of the stock exchange is a good opportunity as all market development needs to go through a process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) proposed last Friday to set up the board to attract new-economy companies to list in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I know it is not easy to do such things," he said. "Not only does it need to consider the market needs, but also the regulatory needs. The balance in between is important."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Securities Association agreed with the development direction of the new board but it is worried about the quality of companies that would list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Association chairman Benny Mau Ying-yuen said the new board could cater to the market needs of the new economy. But since dual-class shares are permitted on it and the sectors it is targeting on are relatively innovative, it may have higher risk compared with other platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though the market is expecting the board to attract well-known international companies, the lower listing criteria may attract some unknown companies or - even worse - troubled companies, which will drag down the overall market quality, said Mau. Since the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> is the regulator responsible for corporate governance, it may result in the situation of "the HKEx treats, the SFC pays," added Mau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange also proposed reviewing the GEM board last Friday by raising the listing criteria, removing the "stepping stone" mechanism to list on the main board, and a compulsory public float of at least 10 percent of the amount issued.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said changes have been made on the GEM board since it was launched, but what is more important is to maintain quality of the market, so problems must be fixed when they appear.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Wan Tong Yuan</span><span class="s1">'s share price spiked 62 percent to 45 HK cents in the gray market yesterday from its IPO price of 28 HK cents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The burial services provider, which operates in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, said its IPO was oversubscribed 102 times and it raised a net of HK$45.6 million. Trading of its shares will start today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the international tranche of Henan Jinma Energy Company's public offering was reportedly oversubscribed. It opened its retail book yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other developments, Baidu unit </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is reportedly aiming at an initial public offering in the United States as early as next year which could value China's most popular </span><span class="s3">Netflix</span><span class="s1">-style streaming video service at more than US$8 billion (HK$62.4 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is about to start talks with banks and deal arrangers and is shooting for a valuation of up to US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu wants to continue holding a controlling stake in </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> after the IPO by issuing dual-class shares. The IPO process, however, is in its early stages and the final valuation could change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1">, the only Chinese service that licenses shows from </span><span class="s3">Netflix</span><span class="s1">, needs to build up its war chest as it battles rival platforms run by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700).</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> will earmark HK$3 billion for the purpose of purchasing properties in locations which are convenient for transportation, chairman Carlson Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It can also resort to borrowing in pursuit of its plans to acquire properties not necessarily located in Central, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Plans for the SFC to have its own properties are aimed to stabilize the commission's rental expenses and its financial condition, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Details of the purchase plans are to be discussed this year, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC was supposed to record a HK$44 million deficit in fiscal year 2017-2018, based on an average daily turnover of HK$93 billion in the city's stock market between January and August last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But with the uptrend in turnover which raised the daily average turnover to HK$160 billion last month, the SFC might end up with a surplus, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He predicted though a deficit of HK$128 million in fiscal year 2018-2019 based on estimates that daily average turnover in the local market would be around HK$109 billion. However, actual daily turnover will depend on market movements, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong has forecast fiscal year 2018-2019 revenue at HK$1.87 billion and expenses at around HK$1.99 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the 2018/19 budget, the commission bared plans to raise salaries and add 21 more posts, including four new staff in its corporate finance division who will help handle work related to dual-class shares firms, Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said it has not yet been decided whether to introduce "sunset provisions" to firms with dual shares and which plan to list on the local market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is awaiting the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s (0388) release of details of its public consultation. The HKEx's first consultation document had several "sunset provisions," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chief executive Ashley Alder said the HKEx will soon announce the results of its public consultation. He predicted the HKEx will reveal which type of firms with dual shares can list on the local bourse.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese web portal and social media firm </span><span class="s3">Sina Corp</span><span class="s1"> is planning a secondary listing in Hong Kong, in what would be one of the first floats to take advantage of the city's new rules designed to attract tech equity offerings, two sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nasdaq-listed Sina, which has a 46 percent stake in China's Twitter-like Weibo Corp, is working with advisers on the listing that will likely take place in the fourth quarter, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offering size is yet to be finalised, the sources said on condition on anonymity as the deal details were confidential.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sina did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing plan comes at a time when </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has loosened its rules to woo Chinese new-economy companies, including tech firms and early-stage drug developers, to list in the Asian financial hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the new rules, firms in Greater China that listed in New York or on the main board of the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on or before December 15, 2017 are allowed to list in Hong Kong with their existing weighted voting rights structures- which give greater powers to founding shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is a big shift for Hong Kong whose one-share-one-vote principle has for 30 years blocked efforts by tycoons from Li Ka-shing to Alibaba's Jack Ma to list alternative shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is hoping that easing rules for secondary listings and allowing primary listing of companies with dual-class shares will help it compete better with New York and mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s (3690) shares closed as much as 3.62 percent higher than its initial public offering price in the grey market last night, ahead of its trading debut in Hong Kong today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It ended at HK$71.5 per share at the grey market trading of Phillip Securities, while its IPO price was set at HK$69.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Tencent (0700) backed unicorn recorded a total turnover of HK$192.45 billion at the security.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With that, those who subscribed would have seen an HK$250 gain per board lot on books.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail tranche of dual-class listed </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> was reportedly oversubscribed by 0.5 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following that, Singapore-listed Geo Energy Resources said it is also interested in going public in Hong Kong with a weighted voting rights structure. "The board believes that having a primary listing status in two leading global capital markets in Singapore and Hong Kong is beneficial to the company as this provides the company with ready access to these different equity markets, a more diverse investor base, additional sources of financing and closer proximity to the Greater China market," it said in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, China Renaissance, which will be listed on the main board next Thursday, saw the international placement trance of its IPO oversubscribed five times. It was believed that Hillhouse Capital and The Capital Group have made investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hillhouse Capital, an investor in top Chinese technology firms including Tencent and Baidu, has closed its latest funding round at US$10.6 billion (HK$83.15 billion) as well, it said, making it the region's biggest private equity capital raising.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some retail investors have canceled their margin financing subscriptions to smartphone maker Xiaomi amid a bearish market sentiment, local brokers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to figures from 12 brokerage companies, a total of HK$4.8 billion in lending was recorded, representing an oversubscription of 1.05 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi - despite attracting tycoons including Li Ka-shing, who bought HK$234 million worth of shares, Alibaba chairman Jack Ma Yun and Tencent chairman Pony Ma Hua-teng - saw its margin financing orders recalled by investors who subscribed through eight brokers amounting to HK$1.13 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Data from Cash Financial Services yesterday showed it had lent HK$650 million for subscribing to Xiaomi, compared with HK$2.7 billion earlier this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bright Smart Securities lending was at HK$1.3 billion, representing 3 percent of its reserved quota.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks lost about 3,000 points in the past two weeks, which made it difficult for Xiaomi's initial public offering to attract investors wary of volatility across the region. Before Xiaomi's retail tranche, the delay for its CDR issuance also made it difficult to stir interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More unicorns - including </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping - are expected to list in Hong Kong, although it seems that the retail subscription of the first dual-class structure offering faces a negative response.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past, several mainland companies' listings froze huge amounts of margin financing in Hong Kong. Tencent's China Literature locked up HK$520 billion in capital while </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1"> recorded HK$154.7 billion in margin loans.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rules may pave the way for the listing in Hong Kong of new-economy companies, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said at the HKEX Biotech Summit yesterday that the public consultation will end today, and the new rules are expected to be in place in a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A batch of companies can probably make their debut under the new listing rules before the summer break, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said biotech and firms with dual-class shares will be the first batch of companies likely to list under the new rules, followed by overseas firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rules will facilitate dual listings in the city. More companies will seek a listing on the local bourse after the summer break, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said he hopes to see as soon as possible market valuations of Hong Kong-listed mainland biotech companies surpass those of companies listed in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said investors should be patient with new-economy companies as investing in them entails risks. The new listing rules will strive to address vigorously these risks, he said, adding he will never allow the Hong Kong market to become a platform for speculation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's benchmark stock index rose 1.8 per cent to close at a historical high, on optimism the city's stock exchange will see a flurry of initial public offerings from June that will help it regain its crown as the world's favourite destination for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index rose to close at 31,904.75, surpassing the record previously set on October 30, 2007. Advances were led by banks, property stocks, and a 19.8 per cent increase this year in the stock price of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited</span><span class="s1">, the bourse operator. The HSI is now also only 53 points from reaching an intraday record high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The record close came after HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia unveiled a reform to listing rules that will allow large biotechnology companies without revenue and other new-economy firms to apply to list their dual-class shares in Hong Kong from the end of June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There will be some big names coming in for IPO in Hong Kong, so the market has more momentum,” said Stanley Chan, director of research at Emperor Securities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.54 per cent, or 316.86 points, to 12,787.28.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leading the rally was HKEX which shot up 6 per cent to HK$288.00 by Tuesday's close.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law of unintended consequences is a curious thing as HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia recently discovered to his cost. Li got himself into hot water with the government which, we understand, was deeply upset by one aspect of his recent blog. As a result, he has had to eat humble pie and issue a "clarification" in which he is reduced to blaming the press for "some confusion" about the purpose of the blog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Readers will recall that we reported on Tuesday that Li had revived the issue of the Alibaba listing and the vast opportunities Hong Kong would lose if mainland technology and new economy companies were not allowed to adopt dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He argued that this had come about as a result of a mistaken view that one share, one vote was "a core principle of the Hong Kong market". To demonstrate this, he cited the example of HKEx. "HKEx itself is not subject to this principle, as the Hong Kong government gets to appoint six out of the 12 non-executive directors and name the chairman, regardless of how many HKEx shares it owns (currently 5.8 per cent)."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This, he says, can be justified on grounds of public interest, and "shareholders' interests are subordinate to public interest".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li possibly didn't couch this in sufficiently reverential terms, but the government appears to have been annoyed with him for subjecting this example of shoddy corporate governance under the spotlight. As Li put it, "On further reflection, it may not have been the best of examples."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The upshot has been that the focus has shifted from the discussion of dual-class shares to his row with the government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not so transparent</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Real estate broker Midland somewhat grudgingly held a press conference this week to discuss its lamentable results. But it was only after pressure from its second-largest shareholder Apex Benchmark, whose senior executives include a number of former Midland honchos. It would have been the first time in about 10 years that Midland would not have held a press conference to discuss its results.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked why the company had originally opted not to have a press conference, chairman Freddie Wong Kin-yip said there was no rule requiring a listed company to do so. "I am very shy and like to keep low-profile. In any case, we are a very transparent company, and you can see everything on our website."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the criticisms levelled at Wong was that Midland was leasing properties from him for its own use at, shall we say, rather full values.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Midland yesterday issued a stock exchange notice reporting lease renewals for two such connected transactions. One shop in Taikoo Shing was rented for HK$102,000 per month, a drop of 6.3 per cent from the previous rent. Another, in Tsim Sha Tsui, saw the rent increase 12 per cent to HK$162,000 per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The price per square foot was not given, which seems a pity given the "transparency" Wong was boasting about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whisky galore</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now for something that every self-proclaimed world city should have - a whisky festival. Hong Kong's first whisky festival - Malt Master HK - takes place this weekend at Crown Wine Cellars at Shouson Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The event is being organised by Ian McKerrow, who comes from a family steeped in whisky, so to speak. His father Neil was chief executive of Glenmorangie and will be speaking at the preview dinner. His mother is a Mackinlay, whose family at one time made their own blended whiskies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a four-course dinner tomorrow accompanied by seven whiskies not normally found in retail outlets in Hong Kong. The seven are Balbair 1983, Bowmore 23-year-old Port finish, Auchentoshan Virgin Oak, Peneryn Original - Madeira finish, Glenlossie 1992, Blue Hanger - malt blend, and The Last Drop, of which there are only 388 bottles and, according to Jim Murray's Whisky Bible, is among the world's top 20 whiskies. The dinner also includes talks from whisky experts. All this for HK$2,500.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are two whisky tasting sessions on Saturday, from 12pm to 3pm and 3.30pm to 6.30pm, where for HK$800 there will be more than 50 malt whiskies from 18 major brands that are available for tasting. For an additional HK$200, one gets to attend a master class. For tickets and more details, go to http://maltmastershk.com/[http://maltmastershk.com/] Enjoy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just five years ago, if someone said Shanghai would overtake Hong Kong as a market for initial public offerings, most people would have laughed. But last year, it beat us for the first time, while New York took the top spot as the world's premier IPO market. That should set off alarm bells if the city wants to maintain its status as a global financial hub. We must make sure this doesn't become a declining trend. Our financial services firms and regulators must be flexible and adapt quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, many market players believe this year will see much improvement, both in the overall stock market and IPO listings in particular. For one, the stock market is anticipating a big boost from the so-called full circulation of H shares. The mainland is expected to lift the ban on major owners selling the shares of state-owned enterprises. This is expected to be a big boost to the H shares market in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's Shanghai and not New York that Hong Kong has to worry about in the 2018 IPO stakes[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125873/hong-kong-falling-behind-ny-ipo-rankings-are-investors-ready]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A second major catalyst is the Hong Kong stock exchange's overhaul of IPO rules, which will allow dual-class shares for listing companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The loss of Alibaba's IPO to New York - which offers dual class-listing - in 2014 had been a painful lesson. The rule change will be especially congenial to hi-tech firms in Hong Kong, more of which are being listed at a rapid rate in recent years. In 2016, technology broke into the top five sectors for IPOs in fourth place, and rose to second behind finance last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Finance IPOs last year took up 36 per cent of share valuation, compared with almost 70 per cent in 2016. But during the same period, technology jumped to 20 per cent from just 3.4 per cent in one year. For the nine technology and internet IPOs on the main board, the average public oversubscription rate was 367 times, in contrast with the average of just 2.2 times for the eight finance IPOs on the main board. The enthusiasm of Hong Kong investors for tech IPOs is set to continue.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the more optimistic forecasts for 2018 is one by Deloitte China, which predicts a jump in the value of IPOs in Hong Kong by 25 per cent to 48 per cent. These translate to between US$20.65 billion and US$24.5 billion, compared with US$16.3 billion last year, the lowest since 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It used to be that New York and London were seen as our biggest competitors. Now, Shanghai and Singapore are posing even bigger challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To stay on top of the game, Hong Kong must learn to attract talent and enhance the overall credibility of the listing market to attract high-quality companies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government yesterday came out in support of the Securities and Futures Commission's stance in the controversy over Alibaba's listing plans and rejected calls to strip the stock exchange of its power to approve listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock exchange has no plans to consult the market about any change in listing rules. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine," Chan Ka-keung, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, said at a Legislative Council meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the law, the chief executive can issue directives to the SFC, meaning the government has the final say on any listing issue, but it has never exercised this power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant lobbied the SFC and the stock exchange last month to be allowed to have a partnership structure that would have let its top executives nominate the majority of board members. The regulators refused to budge, saying there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another. Alibaba has since reportedly been looking at listing in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Legislator Charles Mok, who represents the information technology sector, asked the government if new policies were being considered to attract technology firms to list in the city. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine CHAN KA-KEUNG</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an attack on regulators following the rebuff, Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai said last month: "Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes" and "look forward as the rest of the world passes it by".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan rejected allegations that Hong Kong was lagging behind and said that a number of "high quality" technology firms had listed in the city. "Hong Kong is not the only market worldwide to ban dual-class share structures … Most markets ban such structures," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US is the only market that allows the dual-class share structure. The US regulator, the SEC, in the 1980s appealed to the courts to ban such structures. The court ruled the issue would have to be determined by state law. The US has a different system from Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the legislator representing the financial services sector, asked Chan to consider stripping </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> of its power to approve listings, saying there was a conflict of interest between its obligation to shareholders and its role as a regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have seen many mainland companies facing problems shortly after listing here. The government should consider taking away the HKEx's regulatory role," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said that was unnecessary because the SFC had been monitoring the exchange's approval of listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the stock exchange had officially said "no" to Alibaba's proposal, Cheung said there was concern that it had worked with Alibaba behind the scenes to find a way out of the impasse before it had finally agreed to the SFC's stance against any relaxation of the rules.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The introduction of dual-class technology stock listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely to</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">narrow the valuation gap between Chinese and US technology stocks listed in the United States, says the chief executive of exchange-traded fund manager Enhanced Investment Products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tobias Bland said that thanks to the impending launch of the weighted voting right governance structure by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, he expected several Chinese technology “marquee players” - smartphone giant Xiaomi as well as leading fintech players Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> - and Ping An Good Doctor to list with Hong Kong as their primary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights will also lead to dual listings in Hong Kong by technology companies that are already listed in the US as American depositary receipts, he said. Together, the growing number of technology stocks in Hong Kong will mean that the price-to-earnings multiples of Chinese technology American depositary receipts - and their respective share prices - would be due for an upgrade, said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weighted voting rights structure, which is still not allowed by Chinese regulators, will also incentivise more Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, industry players have long said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we look at Chinese American depositary receipts that make up our exchange-traded funds portfolio, last year they had a 70 per cent run on average in their share prices based purely on their revenue growth, which is about 40-50 per cent on average per year. Yet, they are trading at an average 28-29 times the 2018 expected earnings, which is a big gap compared with the 35 times average of US internet stocks,” said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American depositary receipts are the US dollar-denominated shares of a non-US company. Created by depositary banks, these represent one or several underlying shares from the company's local stock market, and are interchangeable with the underlying stocks.Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuationsJerry Peng, China equity strategist, Citi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors seeking to profit from price level differences between underlying stocks and their US-listed counterparts often create or cancel American depositary receipts through depositary banks. In such arbitrage trading strategies, investors target to profit by selling American depositary receipts trading at a premium to the underlying stock, and buying the underlying stock, or vice versa. Hence, arbitrageurs help to narrow out the price differentials that could exist across the two markets, enabling their prices to often track each other closely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Bland said, the good news for holders of American depositary receipts - such as those of </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, NetEase, Ctrip, Baidu, Alibaba - is that they can expect to see their price-to-earnings multiples getting re-rated by investors in the US market. Tencent, for example, is trading at forward multiples of more than 40 times, and that could be a level that the earnings multiples of other American depositary receipts could match as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the moment, their American depositary receipts performance is often hurt by a general scepticism among US investors about Chinese names,” he said. Contrarily, investors in China and Hong Kong have better understanding of their businesses as frequent users of their services, and such understanding will support Hong Kong-listed technology stocks' performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jerry Peng, China equity strategist at Citi, however, said that while he did not rule out that American depositary receipts might be boosted by strong investor sentiment around more Chinese technology stocks listing in Hong Kong, any such benefits are likely to be short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Offshore investors still look at fundamentals. Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuations,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peng said investors who trade American depositary receipts and Hong Kong stocks will still look at the American depositary receipt levels as reference for valuations, as many leading technology focused investors are still based in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of these American depositary receipt investors trade global technology stocks, including those listed in Korea, Taiwan and China … they already know a lot about these companies. Hence, in terms of knowledge of the issuers they are not significantly disadvantaged to Hong Kong investors,” said Peng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX is expected to launch a formal consultation on the proposed amendments to listing rules that will pave the way for the launch of weighted voting rights during the first quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange is making its biggest push in decades to attract Chinese tech companies. But Wall Street is not fazed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the city fell from the top and slid behind New York and Shanghai in overall dollar volume raised through initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an effort to regain supremacy, the bourse said in December it would relax rules to allow controversial dual-class share listings and let young biotech firms list before they turn profitable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital markets professionals on Wall Street agree that the proposed changes, once they take effect, are likely to make Hong Kong more competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these are not earth-shattering alterations, given their availability on bourses globally for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is largely matching what other Exchanges currently permit,” said Gregg Noel, head of the West Coast capital markets practice at law firm </span><span class="s3">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom LLP</span><span class="s1">, which has advised hundreds of IPOs globally, including Chinese online retailer </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">'s 2014 IPO on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes “will be immensely helpful for Hong Kong to try to take the cream of the crop,” he said, indicating that the rule-easing aims to attract a particular group of fast-growing Chinese tech and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not going to suddenly shift the rest of the global listers' attention entirely to Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also a less-than-adequate challenge to the US IPO market, which remains the most liquid and mature in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You have the deepest pockets in the US,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management. “The demand is high for Chinese IPOs because the returns are great.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funtleyder's fund, for example, saw its investment in Chinese biopharma company </span><span class="s3">BeiGene Limited</span><span class="s1"> quadruple as the firm's stock rose to US$136 (HK$1,063) after its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> IPO in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US market is also among the most flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong requires every offering to have a retail tranche, US banks can decide whether to sell shares to individual investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, while Hong Kong has a one-week gap between pricing and trading, US shares begin trading the day after they are priced. Both measures help reduce the exposure of companies to US market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class share listing that Hong Kong is expected to introduce has already been offered by many bourses globally for years, including those in the US, Canada, Brazil, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Russia and Finland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1"> opted for a dual-class share structure in its 2004 IPO. Social media company </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1"> took it to an extreme with its US$3.4 billion deal in March 2017 as the first listed company to only issue stock with zero voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such listings, which allow founders of public companies to maintain control of their firms even with minority ownership, have become a favoured tool of tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's unwillingness to provide </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd</span><span class="s1"> with that option largely forced the Chinese e-commerce company to bypass the city for its gigantic US$25.7 billion listing in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bitter loss of Alibaba was a catalyst in a years-long debate over the need for Hong Kong to loosen its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle between Hong Kong and New York for Chinese tech companies' IPOs has intensified as more start-ups have matured and become ready to seek financing through a public offering. The race became more urgent after a number of high-profile companies bypassed Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Ctrip.com</span><span class="s1"> are among the mega Chinese tech companies that have opted for a </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2008, China has been the top source of IPOs by non-American companies in the US; the trend is not expected to slow this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tech has been the biggest sector for Chinese companies listing in the US since at least 2009, according to Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track such data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The country has great tech companies and a strong entrepreneurial culture,” said Bob McCooey, senior vice president of Nasdaq's Listing Services unit. “These founders will be recognised globally when they are listed here [in the US].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early this month, MCooey told the Post that the number of China listings in the US this year was expected to be “materially higher” than a year ago, rising 25 to 30 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hottest American sectors for Chinese IPOs in the year to come will be data centres, streaming businesses, education, life science, wearables and enterprise technology providers, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One high-profile company, Huami, a Chinese maker of wearable devices that has partnered with Xiaomi, went public on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Hong Kong has been losing ground. While US IPOs surged 55 per cent to 174 deals in 2017, Hong Kong saw just a 28 per cent increase, to 149 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">'s December Global IPO Trends report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO growth last year also lagged the 49 per cent average global increase in IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's endeavour to regain IPO market share could hit more bumps as the administration of US President Donald Trump pushes to pare financial regulations to spur economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A top priority for Jay Clayton, the new chief of the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">, the agency responsible for enforcing American securities laws, is to further streamline the IPO process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clayton, a former capital markets lawyer with the New York firm </span><span class="s3">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</span><span class="s1">, advised on Alibaba's IPO. Since taking the SEC's helm in May, Clayton has been actively looking for ways to encourage more companies to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In prepared testimony, Clayton said in June that “fewer companies are choosing to enter the public capital markets than in the past”. The SEC's aim, he said, was “promoting firms' access to capital markets”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July he expanded a programme that allowed all companies seeking to go public to keep their financials private longer, increasing their flexibility in the listing process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street bankers and lawyers have told the Post they believe a further easing of restrictions is on the way. One area being explored is finding ways to shield public companies from potential shareholder litigation, according to people familiar with the discussions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial communities of both Hong Kong and New York are watching closely as a slew of blockbuster IPOs from Chinese technology firms are in line to go public in the next two years, with an estimated total market capitalisation of US$500 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, is talking to banks for its planned listing next year, which could be valued at US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, a financial unit of Alibaba that delayed its 2017 IPO plan, was valued at US$60 billion in its latest funding round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, a Chinese online platform for ordering food and booking movies, and Toutiao, a Chinese news aggregator, are other mega IPOs coming in the next 24 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, when Hong Kong announced its proposed marketplace changes, the move was touted as “the biggest change of the exchange rules since 1993”, when it opened its door for Chinese enterprises to go public there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The emergence of the new economy, particularly in mainland China, is a fantastic catalyst for us to take a closer look at our business and see if we're as competitive and attractive as we can be,” Hong Kong Stock Exchange CEO Charles Li wrote in a blog post last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect companies from the new economy to begin applying for listing under the new rules by the end of June this year,” Li wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early responses have been encouraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This month, smartphone maker Xiaomi was said to favour Hong Kong over New York as the location for its initial stock listing that would be, arguably, this year's most-coveted Chinese tech IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If that happened, Xiaomi, said to be valued at about US$100 billion, would be the first company to take advantage of Hong Kong's newly revamped listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc, a biotech company owned by </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Co, also was reported to be planning a Hong Kong IPO. The offering, expected to occur in the second half of this year, could raise at least US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, Alibaba founder Jack Ma said in January that he would consider listing the company in Hong Kong, during a meeting with city chief Carrie Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong “has made strong progress in attracting more small- and medium-sized companies, a trend that is set to continue,” Terence Ho, Greater China IPO Leader at E&amp;Y wrote in the firm's December report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In particular, it is showing success in turning itself into a listing hub for technology and other ‘new economy' firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's wooing will probably make people think twice about getting listed in New York,E Squared's Funtleyder said,“but the bottom line is, the US continues to have a much deeper market and a really sophisticated investor base.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan Ka-keung, the former Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has joined online lender WeLab as a senior adviser, the second top minister to join the budding fintech sector in as many months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining WeLab is Chan's first major private sector commitment since he left the government in July last year after serving in the post for 10 years. He has since returned to academics as an adjunct professor of finance with the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 61, has taken a path similar to former financial secretary, John Tsang Chun-wah, who was defeated last year in his bid to become the city's chief executive, and in June joined fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific as vice-chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan declined to reveal his salary for his role in WeLab, which he took up on July 6 but was only made public on July 16.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said this was not a full-time job and that he could advise other fintech companies as well while continuing to teach at the university. At WeLab he will only help with setting out strategy and will not be involved in the day to day operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I taught at the university in the first part of my career. Then I joined the government for 10 years as a minister. Now I think it is right time for me to open a new chapter in my career in fintech,”Chan said WeLab's office in Sheung Wan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I always promoted fintech when I was in the government. During the past 12 months at the university, my focus has also been on financial technology and start-ups. By joining WeLab, it gives me a chance to put academic theory about financial technology into use,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's decision to join WeLab has a lot to do with his faith in co-founder Simon Loong.The home-grown unicorn - which has a valuation of US$1 billion - will be among the first batch of companies to apply for a virtual banking licence from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), Loong told the Post in an exclusive interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority is now accepting application from new players to set up virtual banks which purely offer services online without any physical branches.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The online lender last week filed an application to list on the main board of Hong Kong stock exchange.Brokers speculate it may raise US$500 million, although the company has not made any comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“WeLab is a start-up which uses big data and other new technology to approve and handle loan approval. It is full of young staff below 30 years old. I like to work with young colleagues to try something new,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said fintech development in Hong Kong has taken huge strides since the HKMA brought in a range of measures last September to promote banks to use new technology to cut costs and enhance their services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chan was in government, e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014 opted for listing in New York instead of Hong Kong as the city at the time did not accept dual-class shareholding companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April implemented massive listing reforms to attract dual-class shareholding companies and biotech tech firms without revenue to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We did all want Alibaba to list here but our regulations would not let that happen. There was no regret as we had to follow the regulations at the time. We do hope after the listing reform of HKEX, we can now attract many of the unicorns to list in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's successful listing marks the beginning of an era for multiple class shareholding companies to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, said it was a positive move for a former minister to join the fintech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Fintech is a hot topic in town and has a lot of room for development,” Cheung said. “It will be good to have these experienced government officials join the fintech industry as this will help forge closer ties between the public and private sector and promote Hong Kong as a smart city.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's decision to list in New York has dealt a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange as the highly anticipated listing of China's e-commerce giant is critical for Asia's vibrant capitalist hub to reclaim the global crown for initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a genuine loss for Hong Kong after Alibaba picked the US market to host its long-awaited [listing], which could be the swing factor for global bourses to attain the status of the world's largest listing hub for the year," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY, a professional services firm. "With an expected sizeable share sale, Alibaba's listing can easily be a game changer for Hong Kong, where fast-growing technology firms remain a minority group in the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s US$16 billion flotation in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital raised in Hong Kong's listing market rose 88 per cent year on year to HK$169 billion last year, making it one of the top three listing hubs globally. But the city has struggled to win prominent deals, partly due to a slowdown in listings of international companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Lee, a lawyer at </span><span class="s3">Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft</span><span class="s1">, said Hong Kong still could not get rid of its image as the "listing venue" for mainland-based companies. In one notable example, the Glazer family, owner of Manchester United, had once considered listing the English football club in Hong Kong or Singapore in 2011 before it picked New York as it insisted on adopting a dual-class structure to retain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants agreed that it was time for Hong Kong to review its listing regime but it needed to strike a balance with good corporate governance and investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fund manager with a British fund house said the city should defend the "one share, one vote" system since the overall corporate governance in most Asian countries remained largely behind international standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers said it was natural for Alibaba to list in the United States since the infrastructure, valuations and liquidity there gave it a leg up on Hong Kong, but they argued that the mainland internet giant might still consider a secondary listing in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A total of US$3.8 billion was raised in the US equity markets by mainland technology firms since 2013, compared with US$2.7 billion in Hong Kong, according to Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said: "Theoretically, it is still possible for Alibaba to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange since the firm has not filed any official document to the US regulators, or the firm may choose to do a secondary listing in Hong Kong if the rules permit."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee concurred, saying there was no absolute guarantee that Alibaba would not seek a secondary listing since it had just started working on the US application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The capital market is getting more sophisticated as well-established companies are offered to list their shares in different jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft, a mainland software firm, is looking to raise about US$300 million through a spin-off of its security software business in the US. The company is also proposing a dual-class structure that would allow it to retain control after the offering.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than a dozen technology and biotech companies could be part of the first batch to apply for a Hong Kong listing under new rules being introduced from next week, according to Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange said on Tuesday[https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/News-Release/2018/180424news?sc_lang=en] that new rules to broaden the listing regime will take effect on Monday, when the exchange will begin accepting formal applications under a system that permits dual-class shares - a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new regime also opens the door to pre-revenue biotech companies, as well as dual-class shareholding companies already listed in the US, such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not know if companies will submit applications on Monday but I believe they will apply very soon after the new listing rules are effective,” said Li, as he announced the conclusions of a one-month consultation process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many companies indicate they are ready to file a listing application. What they are waiting for is the introduction of the new listing regime.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will not be in the single digits, more than a dozen companies will apply,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li believes the first batch of listings under the new rules will take place in June and July, while a second round will happen in the autumn, after the exchange's summer break.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would not confirm if mobile phone maker Xiaomi, as many expect, will be at the front of the listing queue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I have some idea. I cannot talk, as we are the regulator,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The one-month consultation on the proposed rule changes ended in late March, after receiving 283 responses. A majority were in support of the reform, but some institutional investors and fund houses called for greater protections for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Upon consideration, HKEX said it would require companies with multiple classes of shares to set up a corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent non-executive directors. Its election will be on a one-share-one-vote principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has decided not to adopt a measure that would cap the holders of premium-class shares to less than 50 per cent of the total issued shares in the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The founders or key management who own the premium class of shares could be in the form of limited partnerships, trusts, private companies or other vehicles. But the shares of these entities cannot be transferred to other people or entities not entitled to own premium shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another requirement stipulates that the special voting rights attached to premium shares will be invalid if an individual ceases to act as a director of the company or if they die.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans to have another consultation before July 31, on whether corporations should be allowed to own premium shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange also provided guidelines for the definition of sophisticated investors who can invest in biotech companies, as well as guidelines on cornerstone investors who invest in the companies ahead of an IPO.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is launching the reforms to capture more tech listings, in the face of intense competition from mainland China, as Beijing has also launched a scheme to attract tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, however, said he believes companies could opt to list both in Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Lau, a partner and head of capital markets at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China, said there has been strong interest from both Chinese and international companies in emerging sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect there will be at least 10 to 15 new-economy companies listed under the new regime by the end of 2018. The actual number could be higher depending on market sentiment and how fast the listing applicants can move through the vetting process,” said Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While it is possible that some of those companies may opt to list in China, considering the potential deal size, it is also possible that these companies could also have a secondary listing in Hong Kong to take advantage of liquidity in both markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner with US-based law firm Dechert in Hong Kong, also said foreign companies had expressed strong interest in the reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have some US-based clients who have expressed interest to list their China operations in Hong Kong,” he said. “Our clients would like to be among the first batch to list under the new rules. Some may set a listing target in Hong Kong by the end of this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan added that technology valuations may be higher in the US, but that Hong Kong is considered a home market for many Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“International investors can trade shares in these Chinese companies in Hong Kong, while mainland investors can also trade shares of these companies via the Stock Connect,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may be set to its listing rules and introduce the a dual-class share structure in the city, after </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it plans to consult the market on the launch of a third board in an effort to attract more technology and new-economy firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of the agenda is the controversial issue of whether dual shareholding structure should be allowed, said HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Thursday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX consulted the market on a dual shareholding structure two years ago, which would have allowed one class of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eventually the idea foundered, after the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> opposed the proposal due to what is claimed was a lack of sufficient investor protection - a subject which is likely again to dominate discussions this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow poor performers to exit from the new board," Li told a media briefing on Thursday.Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should be [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade. There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow the poor performers to exit from the new boardCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange would be involving the SFC in the consultation process, in an effort to ease their fears last time, and investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will have discussions with the SFC and hope to work out a future direction," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using duel shareholding structures, which are banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request for a shareholder structure, which the commission considered as dual structured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has told the Post that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs or requirements of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse is also planning to launch gold and iron ore contracts this year and a primary connect system aimed at attracting international companies to list in Hong Kong, which could then be offered to mainland investors via the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect links, Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Major international players such as Apple or </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1"> might consider listing in Hong Kong and offering their shares to mainlanders subscribed to a new primary connect system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This will strengthen Hong Kong's listing market and offer more choice for mainland investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in his briefing, Li said the exchange continues to work on reforming the poorly performing Growth Enterprise Market, and is working on a bond connect and one for exchange-traded funds, which again could both be linked to mainland markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrail Group, one of China's largest dental services providers, faces a dilemma on whether to list shares in Hong Kong or New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the eyes of founder and chairman Robert Zou Qifang, Hong Kong's geographical and cultural proximity to the mainland is a clear advantage, but the ban on dual-class shares structure for non-technology firms listed in the city is a major stumbling block.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong's biggest advantage is its proximity and good investor understanding of the mainland market,” he told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The United States' financial market is more mature where investors have a better understanding of growth industries.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After raising US$200 million via four rounds of private share placements since 2010, Zou believes the company is almost ready to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company operates 10 dental clinics in Beijing, and 91 in total across the country, employing 645 dentists. About 30 additional dental clinics are planned to open this year. Zou says he has a target of 1,000 clinics nationwide within the next eight years. The expansion will require 5 billion yuan (US$774.04 million) over seven years to 2025.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be partly funded by partnering with senior dentists working at its clinics, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> last month said it plans to allow technology and “new economy” firms with over HK$10 billion of market value to list with multiple classes of shares carrying different voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change was aimed at attracting more jumbo listings to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zou said given its high-growth nature in an emerging industry, Arrail would try to convince HKEx to let it list while keeping its dual-share structure, adding it was already close to the HK$10 billion threshold after last year's private share sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As high growth firms typically require multiple share placements that severely dilute the original owners' holdings, a dual class shares structure is essential for maintaining our vision and direction,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrail has yet to engaged in talks with HKEx on the matter. Should an agreement fail to materialise, Zou said he would bypass Hong Kong in favour of New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zou expects China's dental service market to grow to 1 trillion yuan by 2030, reflecting an annual growth rate of 19 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's direct oral health care spending per capita was US$9 in 2016, compared to the global average of US$43.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will keep up the drive to attract new technology companies to list shares in the city, even as the benchmark share index stands at the threshold of a bear market, having tumbled nearly 20 per cent from its high earlier this year, according to the head of the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Usually when the stock market is not good, there would be a decrease in IPO activity because many listing candidates will delay their listing plans to wait for the market sentiment to improve. However, we have not seen any decline of our IPO pipeline during the recent market volatility. The number of IPOs in the pipeline remains strong,” said CEO of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This showed the listing candidates still have confidence in the Hong Kong market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, speaking on the sidelines of a conference at the </span><span class="s3">American Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> on Friday, attributed the downtrending stock market to concerns over the widening trade war between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Globally, the economic foundation remains strong. There is no panic selling. The volatility of the market is mainly due to the anxiety of the trade war. I could not comment if this will be a short term phenomena or if it will last for a while,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that while IPO pricing was a factor in any decision to list shares, other considerations also played a role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies want to raise funds to meet their expansion plan and to enhance their competitiveness,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are 240 outstanding IPO applications still active and pending for approval, as at the end of August this year, compared with 198 outstanding applications a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX reclaimed its crown as the world's largest IPO market, surpassing New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the exchange carried out the biggest reform to its IPO rules in more than two decades, enabling the listing of technology companies with dual-class shares, as well as pre-revenue biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms helped attracted three dual-class shareholding companies so far this year, including July's listing of mobile phone maker Xiaomi. Seven biotech companies have applied for a listing, while two have already been completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is good to see the listing reforms have removed the regulatory barriers to allow these companies to list here. Hong Kong will be a listing hub for these technology and biotech companies, so they do not need to go to the US,” Li said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange operator is on track to achieve a full-year net profit increase of 25 per cent to HK$9.27 billion, according to consensus market estimates by Bloomberg.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Despite the market volatilities this year, the market turnover is still higher than a year earlier, which has brought in higher trading-fee income for the exchange,” said Ben Kwong Man-bun, a director of brokerage firm KGI Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In addition, the HKEX in April carried out the listing reform to allow dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list here. This has boosted up the number of IPOs and helped add in listing-fee income,” Kwong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kwong, however, warned of challenging times ahead because the US-China trade war and interest-rate increases in the US and Hong Kong will continue to haunt the market in the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading fee income stood at HK$4.85 billion, up 40 per cent annually. The average daily turnover in the first nine month was HK$114.7 billion, up 40 per cent over the HK$82 billion in the same period in 2017, according to the HKEX data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing-fee income also increased 38 per cent to HK$1.31 billion in the first nine months this year, up from HK$947 million a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising listing fees resulted from a 46 per cent year-on-year increase in the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) to 166 companies during the first nine months of the year. Total funds raised by these firms rose even higher, by 177 per cent to HK$242.67 billion in the first nine months, the exchange data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong beat New York to reclaim the crown as the No. 1 market worldwide for IPOs in the first nine months of this year, according to data from Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The driving force was the listing reform in April, which attracted three big technology blockbusters in the third quarter. They included China Tower's US$6.9 billion IPOs in August, which is the largest worldwide this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other two IPOs were of dual-class shareholdings companies: smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in July, and China's food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">, which attracted US$4.2 billion in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 47 per cent of IPO funds raised during the third quarter were by either telecommunications or hi-tech firms. In contrast, 61 per cent of IPO funds were raised by financial firms in the same quarter a year earlier, Refinitiv data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are more than 250 companies in the IPO pipeline for next year, including many in the technology sector, Charles Li Xiaojia said during an interview with </span><span class="s3">Bloomberg Television</span><span class="s1"> in Singapore yesterday. At least a dozen biotech companies are expected go public under new rules designed to attract that sector, he said. Hong Kong first-time share sales have raised $32.6 billion this year, the most of any listing venue globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This year is so difficult and yet we have had a record year, and it looks like we're going to end the year No. 1 globally,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two stock connects linking Hong Kong to the mainland brought in revenue of HK$521 million in the first nine months of this year, up 88 per cent from HK$277 million a year earlier. The two connects have linked up HKEX with </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> since November 2014 and with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in December 2016 for cross-border stock trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Revenue and other income surged 27 per cent in the first nine months to HK$12.296 billion, up from HK$9.66 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its expenditure stood at HK$2.94 in the nine month period, up 13 per cent from HK$2.59 billion a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> commodity trading income was down 4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of HKEX were up 1.3 per cent at HK$224.60 at midday close on Wednesday morning before the results were released during the lunch break.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six months after pushing through the biggest change in Hong Kong's listing rules in three decades, what has the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) gained?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its stock price has plunged nearly 19 per cent since April 30 when the reform kicked off, losing HK$60.53 billion (US$7.72 billion) in value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia touted the success of the listing reforms that the exchange operator had pushed through with the city's securities watchdog agency, he described it as the biggest game-changer since 1993, when Chinese companies were able to raised capital in Hong Kong through H shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will not be in the single digits - more than a dozen companies will apply” to raise capital in Hong Kong, Li said at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform opened the way for tech companies with weighted voting rights - commonly known as dual-class shares - and pre-revenue biotech firms to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six months later, Hong Kong's key stock index is in bear market territory, interest rates are up, and the appetite for raising capital has shrunk. As many as 19 so-called Chinese new-economy companies raised HK$115.8 billion in Hong Kong in the first nine months, more than double the HK$53.8 billion raised by 17 Chinese new-economy companies in New York, according to the HKEX data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While that was enough to help Hong Kong reclaim its crown as the world's favourite market for IPOs, it could not have come at a worse time. The market is down, which means most of the companies are trading below their IPO prices, and that has scared other companies away from raising funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four of the five companies that did list under the new rules, including the world's fourth-biggest smartphone maker Xiaomi, either had a flat trading debut, or fell on their first trading day. Online food delivery </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> was the only company to debut at a premium, according to Bloomberg data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even long-term investors had their fingers burnt, as these five stocks had fallen by between 20 to 56 per cent below their IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is definitely a disappointing set of results for the listing reform,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a veteran stockbroker who is also Hong Kong's lawmaker representing the financial services constituency. "The number of new listings under the new regime is far fewer than expected. These stocks are not performing well, and investors have lost money. The benefit of the listing reform is far less than anticipated.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New listing rules likely to attract a dozen applicants in first round, says HKEX chief executive[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2143158/new-listing-rules-likely-attract-dozen-applicants-first]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The failure with Hong Kong's listing reforms wasn't merely the plunging stock prices, but the fact that the city remains the go-to market for Chinese companies, but not anyone else, said Kenneth Leung Kai-cheong, a lawmaker who represents accountants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many tech companies in the US, Israel, Singapore that need to raise funds,” Leung said. "The HKEX should encourage these companies to list here, to diversify our source of listing beyond just mainland China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li's 2016 bonus may be cut as HKEX turnover shrinks[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2057953/charles-lis-2016-bonus-may-be-cut-hkex-turnover-shrinks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li could not be reached to comment. An HKEX spokesman said the exchange is "very encouraged” by the interest in Hong Kong's new listing regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since HKEX's listing reform, Hong Kong has overtaken the US to become the listing venue of choice for China's new economy companies,” the spokesman said, adding that there are nine biotech firms and another two dual-class companies that are in the queue to raise money in Hong Kong. "It is early days but the progress so far is good.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165850/hong-kong-regains-crown-new-york-no-1-market-raising-funds]To be sure, Li's own pay packet is very much tied to the stock market's performance, as 44 per cent of his HK$45 million in 2016 compensation was tied up in stock options, according to exchange filings. So, the 19 per cent slump in the listed shares of HKEX cannot be good for his final package.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outgoing chairman of the Hong Kong stock market operator said his biggest regret during his six-year tenure was the failure to land the initial public share offering in 2014 of Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow Chung-kong, who stepped down as chairman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, said he hoped that reforms to listing rules announced this week would bring big tech firms like Alibaba to the city's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba is a good company. It was a regret during my term to see HKEX lose Alibaba. I hope the listing reform announced on Tuesday will bring eight or 10 companies like Alibaba to list in Hong Kong,” Chow said at his last media briefing after the AGM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to list in the US rather than Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted under rules at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was met with disappointment in Hong Kong and was the spark for the debate over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what it billed as the biggest listing reform to the exchange in 25 years, HKEX said on Tuesday that from next week it would allow companies with dual-class share structures to list. Such structures are favoured by many tech firms because they allow founders and key managers to keep control even if they hold only minority stakes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said that he would count the listing reform as among his three major achievements, alongside HKEX's takeover of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012 and the setting up of the two Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges that allowed cross-border trading of Hong Kong and mainland China equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX has developed from a local stock market to a global exchange with multiple asset classes,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed on Wednesday at 30,328.15, up more than 30 per cent from the 20,677.16 when Chow took office on April 24, 2012. Its market capitalisation has also risen more than 70 per cent in the period to over HK$34 trillion (US$4.3 trillion). Market turnover in the first quarter of this year stood at HK$146.1 billion, compared with average daily turnover of HK$53.9 billion in 2012.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's new board of directors will elect a new chairman at their first meeting on Thursday. The Financial Services Development Council's chairwoman, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, a former vice-chair of market regulator the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, is widely expected to succeed Chow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What I can say is the overall outlook is positive for the new chairman. As China is going to become the world's largest economy, it will need a world class financial centre and Hong Kong has the conditions to play such a role,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expected blockbuster listing of smartphone maker Xiaomi in Hong Kong looks set to revive the city's fortunes in the global initial public offering (IPO) market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is exactly the kind of poster-boy IPO that the local stock exchange needs to vindicate its most significant changes to listing conditions in decades.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among those changes is the introduction of dual-class share listings, which enable company founders, usually of riskier hi-tech and innovative companies, to retain control after going public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If successful, the IPO of the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker will be a much-needed shot in the arm for our long-standing reputation, now under challenge, as the region's premier finance hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city, overtaken by Shanghai last year for the first time in the global IPO stakes, was still smarting over the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba, the parent of the SCMP Group, in New York in 2014, which holds the record as the world's biggest stock sale.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yunfeng Capital Management, the private equity fund of Alibaba's co-founder Jack Ma Yun, is also an investor in Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The overhaul in listing rules comes as Hong Kong is eager to retake the IPO crown. Beijing-based Xiaomi is seeking to raise US$10 billion, in a sale that values the firm at US$100 billion. This will make the IPO the 15th biggest in the world and the fourth largest in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About a dozen mainland and overseas start-ups have expressed interest in listing in Hong Kong under the new rules. At least two Chinese biotech companies are expected to switch their New York IPOs to Hong Kong to raise a total of around US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which is expected to list in July, is no doubt a real catch for the stock exchange. But authorities should not let it go to their heads. Dual-class share structures deny holders of ordinary shares the same voting rights.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While informed investors may be willing to take the risk, authorities must make sure such ownership structures do not become a back door for dodgy or low-quality companies seeking a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vigilance must be kept up to make sure such companies are innovative and deserving. Otherwise, our international standing will suffer in the long run.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi staged a dramatic turnaround on its second day of trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's market capitalisation surged to HK$425 billion (US$54.2 billion), breaking into Hong Kong's top 10 companies, after the stock was added to widely tracked the FTSE China A50 Index, and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect schemes as soon as this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure quickly rebounded on Tuesday to as much as HK$19.34. It closed at HK$19. On its debut on Monday, it fell 1.2 per cent below the offer price of HK$17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The turnaround was quite surprising as it was just the second day of trading and the fundamental has not changed at all,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “It's mainly due to short-term capital inflows, after it was added to FTSE and HSCI indexes, prompting some funds to chase it before the additions take effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yip said the FTSE China A50 Index is tracked by many passive ETFs, which means they will have to rebalance their portfolios to accommodate the change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share surge has helped Xiaomi break into Hong Kong's top 10 most valuable listed companies, a league that includes </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, AIA, and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">. Xiaomi ranks No 9 at its current market cap, ahead of </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading volumes also soared, with more than HK$9.8 billion worth of shares changing hands on Tuesday, 27 per cent higher than the HK$7.7 billion on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change in fortunes came after index compiler FTSE Russell announced that it would include Xiaomi in a number of its indexes with effect from July 16, including FTSE China A50 Index, which is tracked by nearly US$7 billion worth of funds globally. Consequently, it will remove US sanctions-hit ZTE from the FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday afternoon, the Hang Seng Indexes Company also said that it would add Xiaomi to the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) with effect from July 23. The HSCI family has more than 400 constituents, covering over 90 per cent of Hong Kong stock exchange's market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a constituent of the HSCI, mainland investors will be able to buy Xiaomi shares via the Stock Connect programme, provided Chinese authorities grant approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macquarie, which issued a research report on Monday, set Xiaomi's target price at HK$30, as it expects the company's earnings per share to post a compound annual growth rate of 40 per cent between 2018 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank's analysts said Xiaomi can monetise its large number of active users via various internet services, such as online games, apps, ads, which could be its biggest strength compared to its peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company can benefit from rising profit margins in internet services business for the next three years and its continued smartphone sales growth in India, Europe, and Chinese markets, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi has 190 million monthly active users for its mobile operating platform, according to the company's founder and CEO Lei Jun.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi fell below its offer price on Monday, after its much-anticipated IPO received a lukewarm response amid a weak market, as the company's categorisation of “internet firm” and valuation sparked a close examination by investors and regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Index compiler MSCI said last week it will not add Xiaomi to its benchmark index because the company does not meet the criteria due to its weighted voting rights (WVR) structure.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When a long-held principle no longer reflects the investment reality of new-economy companies, regulators may be forgiven to want to loosen the rules. Companies with different classes of shares may be allowed to list on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange by the middle of next year under a new pilot scheme. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> has had a change of heart about the sacred principle of "one share, one vote", established as a cardinal rule of share ownership in Hong Kong since at least the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A consensus has also emerged among the commission, the government and the stock exchange that it is not necessary to create a new board for listing such companies. Hong Kong has been facing intense competition from rival bourses in such places as New York, Singapore and Shanghai, which have long allowed listed companies to hold dual-class share ownerships. Such share structures enable company founders and/or the management to exercise strategic control even if they don't own a majority stake. Many new-economy and bio-tech companies favour such arrangements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Hong Kong still insists on "one share, one vote", it will be in danger of losing out on the highly lucrative market for initial public offerings. It has lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for IPOs this year, having fallen behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first half of the year, the city's stock market raised just US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, down 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised during the same period last year, when it was ranked as the world's top market for new listings. Indeed, it is still smarting over the IPO of Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] Group Holding, the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post, which skipped the Hong Kong bourse in favour of staging its record US$25 billion flotation in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the new scheme, some start-ups that have reached valuations of over US$1 billion will be allowed to raise capital on the main board. But there will be protection provisions that may include a sunset clause forcing such companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They will also list with a special code to distinguish them from more traditional companies, to help investors identify potential risks. The scheme may expand if enough high-quality companies are attracted to list in Hong Kong without regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The commission's U-turn is welcome. People ought to be able to invest in promising companies with dual shares, provided they know what they are getting into. Transparency is key.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global institutional investors are urging Hong Kong not to change its listing rules even after losing the mega listing of e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to a survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those surveyed, 54 global institutional investors managing a combined US$14 trillion of assets, warned they would on average give a 19 per cent price discount to Alibaba's valuation if it lists with its special shareholders structure intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They also said they would on average put a 13 per cent discount on the Hong Kong market valuation if the city allows a non-standard shareholder structure to accommodate Alibaba-like listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong government and regulators should do nothing with the existing listing rules. The one-share-one-vote principle in Hong Kong has worked well for many years, providing all shareholders with fair treatment," said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the association, which has 100 global institutional investor members including some of the world's largest fund houses, pension funds and insurers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey, conducted on association members early this year, came after Alibaba was reported in October to be in talks with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange refused to grant the exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle. Alibaba last month said it planned to list in the US, which allows the dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba lists with the structure, 71 per cent of respondents said they would not buy the stock or buy it at a discount ranging from 5 to 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia has written several times on his blog since September on the need to relook at listing rules for "innovative" companies, but institutional investors are opposed to any change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Twenty-eight per cent of the respondents gave a "bad" rating to HKEx in its manner of handling Alibaba, compared with 2 per cent "bad" each for the SFC and the government. In comparison, 41 per cent ranked the SFC "good" in its handling of the Alibaba issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Cheng, the association's research director of mainland China and Hong Kong, said some years ago London had allowed the dual class structure but that did not lead to more listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Chan, finance partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Berwin Leighton Paisner</span><span class="s1">, said: "In the US, there is a more disclosure-oriented approach as well as a culture of litigation. Investors don't need the exchanges to protect them as much as they do in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the operator of the city's stock exchange, has signed an agreement with Beijing's over-the-counter exchange, the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), marking the latest effort in its bid to land more mainland technology start-up listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NEEQ, also known as the “new third board”, was created in 2012 to help fund innovative start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of last year, 11,600 firms had signed up to trade on it, raising 400 billion yuan (US$63.53 billion) since inception.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed on Saturday between the two, comes just days ahead of HKEX announcing the conclusions of a public consultation (on Tuesday) on what's likely to be its biggest listing reforms in three decades, including the green light for dual-class listings in Hong Kong for technology and biotech firms, even those without revenues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Friday that firms will be allowed to apply for listings from April 30, while issuing an invitation to tech companies already listed on NEEQ to apply to float shares in Hong Kong too.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong exchange to accept listing applications under new rules from April 30, chief says[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142536/hong-kong-exchange-accept-listing-applications-under-new-rules]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The MOU outlines the creation of a long-term cooperation mechanism by HKEX and NEEQ which will allow a strengthening in their information sharing, regulatory collaboration, and joint efforts in investor education.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The agreement was rubber stamped by HKEX's head of mainland development Mao Zhirong and NEEQ's general manager Li Ming, in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The signing shows both the mainland and Hong Kong are determined to establish a more open and multi-layered capital market,” Charles Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is an open market with clear and transparent listing rules and procedures. We welcome all NEEQ companies that meet our requirements to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We look forward to strengthening our information sharing and collaboration on regulatory matters. We also aim to cooperate on investor education initiatives.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hong Kong-based brokerage Hantec Pacific, welcomed the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology companies now listed on the new third board in Beijing have already approached Hong Kong brokers to arrange listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The MOU and the listing reforms [to be announced on Tuesday] will help attract more of these technology companies to list in Hong Kong this year,” Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While new third board start-ups can also opt to list in Shanghai or Shenzhen, Tsui added he was confident HKEX offers a more attractive proposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to mainland regulations, these new third board companies would need to delist from there before they could list in Shanghai or Shenzhen,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX, however, would allow them to list while continuing to trade on the new third board. Hong Kong listing rules are more flexible than those in the mainland.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite many of the likely candidates being small in size, Tsui said they will qualify to list on what is effectively Hong Kong's own ‘second board', the Growth Enterprise Market, which does not require companies to be in profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main board requires applicants to have registered over HK$50 million (US$6.37 million) in profits for the three years before listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“New third board technology firms can be a new source for the GEM. When they grow bigger, they could then move up to the main board. This will help Hong Kong achieve goal of becoming a hub for tech listings,” Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li has vowed to overtake New York's tech-led </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> exchange in size within five years.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government has kicked off the city's biggest auditing regulatory reform in a decade, with the aim of positioning Hong Kong as a hub for technology initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the Financial Reporting Council (Amendment) Bill 2018, which the government gazetted on Friday and is to be presented before lawmakers on Wednesday, the Financial Reporting Council will be empowered to inspect, investigate, as well as discipline auditors in more than 2,000 listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council will take over these additional powers from the industry body, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">. When the council was set up by the government in 2007 it only handled investigations, while other regulatory functions were carried out by the institute. Under the reform, the institute loses all regulatory powers over auditors of listed companies to the council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Bill will enhance the existing regulatory regime for auditors of listed entities, allowing them to be independent from the audit profession, thereby providing better protection to investors. This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and capital market,” said James Lau, the secretary for financial services and the treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies seeking to list dual-class shares may get green light to apply for Hong Kong listing by end June[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2128434/companies-seeking-list-dual-class-shares-may-get-green]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Benchmarking against international standards and practice, the new regime will also enable Hong Kong to be eligible for joining the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators, which is an important forum for international cooperation on the regulation of auditors,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The auditor regulatory reform comes at the same time as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates the city's bourse - the third largest in Asia - is also carrying out its largest reform in three decades, to allow dual-class shareholding companies and large biotech firms without revenue to list as Hong Kong competes with the United States for more technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both moves are aimed at improving the quality of Hong Kong's stock markets as the city attempts to attract more giant technology companies to list and more mainland firms to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lagged behind other financial centres such as New York, London and Singapore because of a lack of an independent auditing regulator. This is also why the city lost out to Singapore in the Corporate Governance Watch 2016 rankings in September.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The introduction of this legislation is in the best interest of the investing public. This much-awaited reform for auditors of publicly listed entities, i.e. from self-regulation to independent oversight, will bring Hong Kong's auditor regulatory regime in line with other major capital markets worldwide, such as New York and London. It will further entrench Hong Kong's status and reputation as a robust international financial centre,” said John Poon, the council's chairman.This is crucial to strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and capital marketJames Lau, secretary for financial services and the treasury</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">, however, raised a number of concerns on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On funding, HKICPA feels the proposed HK$90 million annual budget, a three-fold increase [from current levels], requires further substantiation. Judging from our own experience in regulation, inspection and discipline, the figure seems very high,” the institute said, adding that the government needed to be more forthcoming and transparent about funding, so that everybody knew their respective contributions were reasonable and fair.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A number of our member firms continue to have concerns over the maximum penalty of HK$10 million, which they believe will impose an undue financial burden on smaller firms. Last, but not least, it is not clear how non-Hong Kong auditors will be regulated.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The institute said it would keep on pursuing these issues during the legislative process.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's top destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) during the first quarter, as an absence of blockbuster listings allowed the city to be overtaken by New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sixteen companies chose to list their shares in Hong Kong in the first quarter, raising US$1.5 billion of capital, far behind the 14 IPOs in New York with US$9.6 billion raised. New York's haul was bolstered by </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">'s US$3.9 billion IPO in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai ranked second, with US$4.8 billion, while Shenzhen's ChiNext exchange ranked third with US$2.2 billion raised from technology companies and startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There wasn't any big IPOs in the first quarter, while the HKEX and the Securities &amp; Futures Commission tightened their approval procedures of new listings in both the Growth Enterprise Market and the main board,” said Joseph Tang Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The drop in ranking, as well as the reduced fee income that follows, puts pressure on HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to quicken the process for establishing a third board in Hong Kong, with a more relaxed set of rules including the possibility of dual-class shares, to attract technology companies to raise capital here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the Hong Kong securities watchdog had been conducting a process of public consultations since last year, obtaining public feedback on the best way to change the city's listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook Inc</span><span class="s1"> and Snap adopt dual-class share structures, banned in Hong Kong, but allowed in other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1"> chose New York for its US$25 billion IPO in 2014, catapulting America's financial centre to the top of </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' global ranking that year. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's capital-raising rules are outdated, more suitable for traditional companies like property developers instead of technology and fintech companies, Alibaba's chairman Jack Ma said last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong beat New York for the first time in 18 months to reclaim the crown as the No 1 market worldwide for IPOs in the first nine months of this year, as the listing reform led to a slew of companies raising funds in the city, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This also marked the first time Hong Kong has risen to the top of global IPO rankings since it fell to fourth place in the first quarter of 2017 behind New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the quarterly data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eighty-four companies raised US$28.6 billion through IPOs on </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s main board in the first nine months of the year until Wednesday, up 220 per cent from the US$8.93 billion raised a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York, the top IPO market worldwide since the first quarter of 2017, dropped to second place as 48 companies raised US$25.1 billion during the first nine months. </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> ranked third at US$18 billion while Shanghai took fourth place at US$10.44 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The driving force behind the HKEX's IPO boom was the listing reform in April, which attracted three big technology blockbusters from July to September. About 42 per cent of IPO funds raised so far were by telecommunications firms, hi-tech firms accounted for 5 per cent, retail 19 per cent, financial 13 per cent, real estate 7 per cent and others accounted for the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A year earlier 61 per cent of the funds were raised by financial firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest global IPO so far this year was telecom tower operator China Tower's US$6.9 billion fundraising in August, the biggest since </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$7.6 billion Hong Kong listing in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse, which implemented its biggest listing reform in 25 years in April, allowing companies with dual shareholding structures, new economy as well as the biotech firms without profit or revenue to list here, attracted two mega dual-class shareholding structure companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smartphone maker Xiaomi launched its US$5.4 billion Hong Kong IPO in July and China's food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised US$4.2 billion this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class shareholding companies allow founders and key management to own shares with more voting rights than other shareholders which is favoured by many technology and new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city was the No 1 IPO market worldwide from 2009 to 2011 as well as in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with main board and GEM, funds raised by 144 IPOs in Hong Kong stood at US$29.1 billion in the first nine months, up 208 per cent from a year earlier. It was also the highest amount raised in a decade, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific, said IPOs in Hong Kong will continue to grow but warned of difficulties ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many companies have been rushing through with their IPOs in recent months. The real reason behind the strong IPO market may be that the listing hopefuls have a bearish outlook.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that many IPOs in recent months could only fix their offer price at the low end and some have seen their shares drop below the offer price on debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark indexes of both Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges this year have dropped more than 20 per cent from their peak and briefly entered bear markets, as the ongoing US-China trade war has hurt investment sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, however, is more positive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It expects the strong IPO momentum in Hong Kong to continue in the coming months as the listing reform gives many tech and biotech companies more flexibility, said Edward Au, co-head of Deloitte China's national public offering group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Deloitte estimates a total of 220 new companies, including 10 unicorns, to launch their IPOs this year, up 33 per cent from last year. These companies are expected to raise about HK$300 billion (US$38.41 billion), up 134 per cent from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is likely to remain at the top of the PO ranking for the rest of this year,” Au said, but he cautioned that the ongoing US-China trade war is dampening overall investment sentiment in Hong Kong and this could make investors think twice whether to buy biotech firms that are yet to register revenue or profit.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) is working closely with both Hong Kong and mainland regulators on further moves to try to connect mainland and foreign investors with each other, Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, told an audience at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Securities Institute</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companies,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to his plans, HKEX is considering the creation of what's being dubbed “Primary Connect” - a programme which would allow mainlanders to subscribe for new shares listing in Hong Kong, which in turn will hopefully attract more international firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He refused to give any further details or a timetable on this latest “Connect” initiative, and declined to confirm if those international companies already listed in New York or London, would be able to make secondary listings or secondary share placements via the proposed plan.Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companiesCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange already has two “Stock Connects” in place with their counterparts in Shanghai and Shenzhen, allowed cross trading of shares between the exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also kicked off its “Bond Connect” programme in July which allows mainland Chinese bonds to be traded by international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This [new plan] still needs a lot of parties to discuss the details. What I can say is this new Primary Connect will benefit both the Hong Kong and mainland markets,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li and HKEX have already prioritised their desire to increase the number of major international players listing in Hong Kong, as well as helping more mainlanders to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major exchanges around the world, including Hong Kong, are licking their lips especially, over the prospects of hosting the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of energy giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, expected to be the largest IPO ever when it floats in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market is the third largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation but it is dominated by mainland companies, which take up 60 per cent of its total value with the rest predominantly Hong Kong companies, and a few international listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, say they are working flatout together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for foreign firms, especially new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed the consultation for a plan to launch a new board, referred to as the “third board”, for dual class shares companies or those newly start-ups without profit to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe for Hong Kong to be a serious contender to land the Aramco IPO, or any other major multinational IPO for that matter, regulators would need to design the planned Primary Connect in a way to allow foreign listed firms to have secondary listings or placements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also needs more diversify in its mix of constituent company listings, argue brokers, illustrated well with the fact that 56 per cent of the funds raised in the first half were by financial firms, and less than one per cent from new economy or technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments we have received so far show there is a consensus that Hong Kong cannot afford to miss any opportunities to act as a fundraising hub for new economy firms,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said it would still need a second round of consultation on the details of the new third board before it could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board is proposed to contain two markets - one is for big companies with dual share structure for all investors to trade and another is for start-ups for professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many commentators consider the planned start-up market is a risky tactic, while others think dual-class share companies should be more encouraged to list on the main board, rather than the planned new one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said the bourse could also opt for what he termed a “landing zone” approach to make some change to the proposal regarding the third board plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To the millions of mainland investors frolicking in China's go-go stock market of the early 2000s, given a kick start from the country's membership in the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1">, Laura Cha Shih May-lung was the killer regulator anointed by Beijing to crash the party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, whose married name rhymes with the Chinese word for inspection, soon earned the moniker of the regulator who would “inspect miscreants to their death”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though her tenure as a vice-chairman at the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">from 2001 to 2004 drew mixed responses, it earned her a place in the history of China's capital market development - the first Hongkonger and non-mainlander to take on a vice-ministerial position within the central government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week, the 68-year-old grandmother of three was elected unopposed as the first woman to chair </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the operator of the stock market, in the bourse's 127 years of history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha's ascent comes at a critical time. The exchange is striving to strengthen its relevance and position as the go-to market for mainland companies in the face of increasing competition from global and regional exchanges, as well as China's Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Increasing integration of the Hong Kong and mainland markets, pinned by the city's Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges since 2014 and 2016, makes China a partner but also a rival as the latter wants to bring home some its biggest overseas-listed companies through depositary receipt issuance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) are instituting much-needed listing reforms to entice new economy firms, particularly technology and biotech ones from the mainland, while cleaning up irregularities and excesses.Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to playLaura Cha</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they are also increasing their collaboration with the CSRC to crack down on cross-border frauds, including going after what Beijing calls “big crocodiles”, or wealthy corrupt mainland businessmen who manipulate the capital markets for illegal gains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means Cha has one big balancing act to tackle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pointing to her previous roles at the SFC and the CSRC and now with HKEX, Cha argued that they all differed but did not conflict, as each institution worked towards the common objective of ensuring that Hong Kong's financial markets grew robustly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whether it is globally or locally, regulators such as the SFC and operators like the HKEX are working from different angles, and there is always a balancing act to play,” she said on Thursday at a media briefing after she was elected chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha also said she would draw on her CSRC experience and mainland network to enhance communication between Hong Kong and China and foster stronger cross-border cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In fact, the cross-border cooperation has never stopped since the launch of H shares 25 years ago,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, Cha has made mapping a three-year strategic plan one of her top priorities in the first 100 days in office, to look at how to enhance the exchange's competitiveness from 2019 to 2021 and fend off competition from other overseas exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/9092235e-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the Hong Kong stock market gained 36 per cent last year, it lost its initial public offering (IPO) crown, which it held for the prior two years, to New York, as IPO value dropped to its lowest since 2012. The loss was in part due to the ban on allowing companies with dual-class shareholding structures, commonly preferred by tech firms, to list since the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To regain the sweet spot, HKEX officials, with the SFC's support, have proposed to lift that ban on Monday, under new rules that would also allow biotech firms without revenue to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Long-time rival exchange Singapore also announced in January that it was allowing dual-class share firms, in line with the global trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Needless to say, the job facing Cha is anything but easy, as she will have to oversee one of the exchange's most crucial turning points in its more than a century history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha's major challenge as HKEX's new chairman is the listing reform. Although the HKEX has announced the new rules, the new listing regime has yet to be tested. The challenge for her is to make sure the regime will be implemented smoothly and to attract many new economy companies to list here,” said Bonnie Chan, a partner at law firm Davis Polk. Chan has worked with Cha since 2013 as a council and committee member of the Financial Services Development Council, the government's advisory body on financial issues that Cha still heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“She has strong leadership and is capable of drawing on a pool of professional talent to work for the council … We could not have done so much work without Cha's ability to draw the many professionals to voluntarily do the job,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said she would step down from the council once the government had found a replacement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to the council, Cha, a career financial regulator, had served on the HKEX board from 2006 to 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/8b50afb4-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha had a relative late start to her career to focus on bringing up her two children and being a full-time housewife for six years in the US where she then lived.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was so hard to get help in the US, and as a mother of two I had to be a full-time housewife. I only started my career after my children went to school,” she had said in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was during that period that she became interested in law and returned to school to read law. She qualified as a lawyer in the US before returning to Hong Kong in 1985, when her businessman husband Victor Cha Mou-zing was called back to run the family business, </span><span class="s3">HKR International</span><span class="s1">, the developer of Discovery Bay on Lantau Island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha went to work at a law firm before joining the SFC in 1991, where she stayed till former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji invited her to join the CSRC in 2001. During the decade to 2000, the HKEX and the SFC had garnered extensive experience and expertise in bringing Chinese state firms to market and instilling corporate governance in the process, while weathering the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's stock markets, created in the 1990s with the aim of raising funds for ailing state-owned companies, have long been plagued by insider trading and illicit deals. Wu Jinglian, a renowned Chinese economist, once described the market as a “casino”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha was paid up to 5 million yuan (US$790,557 at current rates) for her CSRC role, in a specially-approved remuneration package that was several times more than what even the Chinese president was earning, according to mainland Chinese media. She took the equivalent salary of her fellow deputy regulators, and donated the remainder of the pay to a fund for educating Chinese regulators, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Cha struggled to implant mature, Hong Kong-style regulatory practises in the mainland to weed out rampant insider trading in the three years she was at the CSRC, as they would have ruffled vested interests. Changing China's broader political, economic and legal framework remains a tall order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But many Chinese investors would hold her as “Hong Kong's iron lady” who helped drive mainland stocks to a three-year bear market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/96617ac8-4950-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_image_hires_105501.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We knew of her as the ‘iron lady',” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai who has been tracking China's stock market since 1998.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not fair to blame the bear market on her, maybe it was a coincidence. No one is powerful enough to let the market rise and the purpose of getting her here then was to strengthen market oversight, not to create a bull market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha returned to Hong Kong after her stint at the CSRC, and has been a member since 2004 of the Executive Council, or cabinet, of all four of the city's chief executives: Tung Chee-hwa, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, Leung Chun-ying and incumbent Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While her return to lead the HKEX has been met with positive responses by her supporters and the exchange's chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, who was recruited nine years ago by a panel that Cha led, her work would inevitably be pitted against predecessor Chow Chung-kwong. In his six years as chairman - the maximum term for any government-appointed director - Chow oversaw the acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and the launch of the Stock Connect programmes.Cha's major challenge as HKEX's the new chairman is the listing reformBonnie Chan, Davis Polk</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said she might struggle to understand the needs of smaller players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Cha was a former SFC head and she has a regulatory mindset. She does not understand the difficulty that many of the 500 local players have in competing with international big players,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker representing the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope Cha would focus more on promoting the financial services industry in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever the challenges, Cha is seen likely to rise above them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ermanno Pascutto, who recruited Cha to the SFC and is now director of the Canadian Foundation for Advancement of Investor Rights, described her as “very adept” at dealing with senior leaders and executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Laura is the sort of person you could send to New York, Beijing or to talk to Legco [Legislative Council] and she would do a creditable job in all of them,” Pascutto said an earlier interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore could be where start-ups prefer to set up shop, but Hong Kong is the market that they want to list in, according to analysts and industry players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"</span><span class="s3">Singapore government</span><span class="s1"> has introduced many measures to support start-ups, which is why it has attracted many new companies to set up there. However, these start-ups would get bigger and want to go public, Hong Kong is a better choice as the overall market size and new listing activities are more active in Hong Kong than in Singapore," said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore in terms of drawing start-ups to establish on its turf. The latest case is Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange, or Lufax, the peer-to-peer lender that was established by Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm was last month given the green light to launch a global wealth management platform by the </span><span class="s3">Monetary Authority of Singapore</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the overall Hong Kong IPO market is more robust. It has raised four times more funds than Singapore so far this year, totalling US$8 billion in 92 IPOs. The island republic has raised only US$2 billion from 13 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is the world's fourth-largest IPO market worldwide while Singapore is not even in the top 10 list. But the flip side is Hong Kong is losing out in the amount of funds raised from technology IPOs as Singapore is ranked fifth, while the city is in the 12th position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is because the majority of funds raised in Hong Kong IPOs were from traditional firms with financial firms representing 56 per cent of all IPO funds raised this year, while technology firms only represented 5.8 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/26/dbb07b10-8989-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_image_hires_002604.jpg]To be fair, 82 per cent of the funds raised by Singapore's 13 deals so far this year was accounted for by one single giant tech firm - the NetLink NBN Trust, which is an associate of Singapore Telecommunications. The US$1.695 billion IPO is also the world fourth-largest technology IPO this year.Singapore government has introduced many measures to support start-ups, which is why it has attracted many new companies to set up thereJoseph Tong, Morton Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is trying to play catch up in technology IPOs. It last week ended a consultation for a proposed third board in 2018 that will house two markets - one for the start-ups and the other for mega dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, has opposed to the start-up market as he said these newly set up companies are too risky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung however urged the HKEX to launch the dual class shares market to attract the so-called unicorn technology companies with a market cap over US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many Chinese unicorn technology companies that like to list in Hong Kong. What we need to do is to prepare our markets to meet the needs of these companies," Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Epi Ludvik Nekaj, founder and chief executive of Crowdsourcing Week said he chose to set up his company in Singapore in 2012 because the process was easy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was a very seamless process with functional government agencies giving me guidance at the early stage, proactive </span><span class="s3">Singapore Tourism Board</span><span class="s1"> attracting cutting edge conference like ours and ever-growing ecosystem," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When it comes to fintech start-ups, allowing them to test their financial products in a controlled environment, [that has] put Singapore ahead of Hong Kong. In addition, the entire government of Singapore is mobilised to reinvent its economy, which puts start-ups as one of the main priorities in the government agenda."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said if the HKEX would launch the third board for start-ups, he would consider listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I may consider if this would be a combination of what a second market of crowdfunding may look."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More Chinese fintech firms vying to go public could choose Hong Kong as their listing venue, after the city's first fintech IPO received a hot response from investors, and that Hong Kong has unique advantages compared with other global financial hubs, said </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> 's head of global investment banking in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, closed nine per cent up from its IPO price on Thursday in its Hong Kong debut. With an oversubscription of nearly 400 times from retail investors, the company had priced its IPO at the top end of the expected range, raising US$1.5 billion in the city's biggest ever fintech offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and CMB International are joint sponsors of the deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Houston Huang, head of </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> 's global investment banking in China, expected the IPO to mark the beginning of more fintech companies seeking a listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A good fintech IPO will have a ‘push effect' on other Chinese fintech players, prompting them to consider linking with the capital market to raise fund," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The next Zhong An could show up in online payment, P2P lending, [financial] product distribution, or online insurance."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang expected China's fintech industry to expand fast in the next few years, due to the rapid spread of mobile technology and the application of artificial intelligence.A good fintech IPO will have a ‘push effect' on other Chinese fintech players, prompting them to consider linking with the capital market to raise fundHouston Huang, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology is driving revolutionary progress in China, " he said. "Fintech is an untapped market, with great growth potentials."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's fintech market could grow to 460 billion yuan (US$69 billion) in revenue by 2020, with a 44 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from 2016 to 2020, according to a recent research note from </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, revenue from online payment is estimated to increase to 202 billion yuan by 2020. Revenue from online distribution of financial products could grow to 52 billion yuan by then, while that for online lending and online insurance may reach 142 billion yuan and 60 billion yuan respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, companies seeking an IPO have to show profit in three consecutive years leading up to the application year, among other regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rules about profitability are less stringent in the US and Hong Kong, which gives the city advantages as described by Huang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also has other strengths, such as its proximity to the mainland market, the Stock Connect schemes that allow mainland investors to directly trade Hong Kong stocks, and comparably lower listing costs than the US, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Zhong An IPO may prompt structural changes in Hong Kong's capital market, which is trying to reduce its reliance on traditional sectors, such as real estate, financial services and energy, and increase the technology component.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given the strong response received for the Zhong An IPO, investors' knowledge and understanding about fintech had also grown, which could make it easier for future fintech companies to gain a reasonable valuation, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Victor Au, chief operating officer at Delta Asia Securities, added that Hong Kong has a persuasive fundraising power, as the city has been among the world's top IPO markets in the past few years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a bid to attract more technology and new-economy companies, the Hong Kong stock exchange has proposed a third board to allow listings by companies with dual-class share structures, which give certain shareholders more voting power than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several stock markets allow such structures, including the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq Stock Market</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, Ricky Chim Kim-lun and Gordon Tsui Luen-on will compete for 622 votes in a four-year term to represent Hong Kong's financial services industry in the Legislative Council. Eligible voters are stockbrokers, futures and gold traders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are all calling for reforms to change the Hong Kong market's dominance by financial services and property companies, to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are also calling for measures to reboot the broking industry, and help the smallest brokers survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A week before the September 4 election, the three candidates speak to the South China Morning Post about their thoughts on listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, 64, the incumbent lawmaker who's seeking re-election, said Hong Kong needs a new board with flexible listing rules to attract technology companies to raise funds here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), launched in 1999 to attract technology firms, was a failure," he said. "We need a new board with listing rules that are more relaxed than the main board and GEM."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its top spot as the world's largest IPO market in 2014 when Alibaba moved its record US$25 billion public offer to New York. Alibaba is owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bars publicly traded companies with a dual shareholding structure, or shares that give shareholders unequal voting rights. That's compelled many technology companies to look instead to the US to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 22 of the 343 companies, or 6 per cent of the total, listed in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013 were technology related, Cheung said. Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If Hong Kong can find a way for dual-class structure that protects investors, I would support it," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government should work with Chinese regulators to let local brokers sign on new clients on the mainland, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a small market with a population of only 7 million," he said. "If Hong Kong brokers can go north to open accounts for clients on the mainland, it would be very helpful."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui Luen-on</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsui, 56, a former banker who joined the securities industry in 2000, is now managing director of Hantec Group International Finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like Cheung, he wants Hong Kong to implement a third board with a different set of listing rules to attract technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs a new board with different regulations from the main board and the GEM to meet the needs of technology companies," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ricky Chim Kim Lun</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chim, 47, is a veteran of the financial industry of two decades, and a director of several listed companies. His seat was formerly held by his father Chim Pui-chung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should follow US regulations to attract a wide range of companies to list here, not just IT firms, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want companies in all industries and all sizes to list here to make it a diversified market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chim is also opposed to letting the SFC decide on what companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong does not need a new board," Chim said. "Hong Kong should adopt a disclosure based regulatory regime that allows companies to list as long as the disclosed information meets the SFC's standards. If the US can do it, so can Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if public companies offer shares with different voting rights, they should still be allowed to raise funds in Hong Kong, and it's up to investors to decide it they want to accept these unequal rights, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's broking industry is dominated by 14 of the so-called Category A brokers owned by large banks, now with 56.2 per cent share of daily transactions, up from 28 per cent in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The middle market, comprising 51 Category B brokers, keep a market share of about 33.4 per cent of trading every day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bottom of the market, with 435 small brokers in Category C, now make up 10.4 per cent of turnover, shrinking from 40 per cent market share from their heyday in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smallest brokers have been unfairly treated by the regulator and the government, Chim said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many government policies don't benefit the small players, and may gradually force them out of business," he said. "There should be more policies in place to help the small brokers compete with the big players."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Hong Kong's proposed listing reforms:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All three candidates object to the listing reforms proposed in June by the HKEX and the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the proposal, two new committees will be established with equal number of representatives from the HKEX and the SFC to set policies for listing companies on the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's too much power in the hands of the SFC, according to all three candidates. The proposal would be of little help to increase the Hong Kong bourse's competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As many as 95 per cent of all the local brokers he'd met are all opposed to the proposed reforms, Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed listing reform would only complicate the listing process and lengthen the time for the approval, " he said. "It would not speed up the process. If the SFC insists on going ahead with the reform, it's going to kill off the market here and add further damage to the low market turnover."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia's booming technology landscape will become large enough for more than one stock exchange to cater for future initial public offerings (IPOs), according to the chief of Singapore's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sector's explosion in the region has had leading regional and global exchanges vying for more tech listings, including Hong Kong, long seen as Singapore's arch rival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asian tech listings are in some ways, a new space,” said Loh Boon Chye, chief executive officer of the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yet no exchange has been able to establish a lead position. Being a new space means there is room enough for a few players; each can take its own track.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/17/183aa842-faa2-11e7-b2f7-03450b80c791_image_hires_205109.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX considers technology - which includes telcos and media firms - among its priority sectors, with 76 technology firms listed already in Singapore, with a combined market capitalisation of US$64 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of the month, South Korea's top mobile messenger operator Kakao Corp will list its global depositary receipts on the exchange, raising US$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh claims Singapore's edge lies in its “strong technology eco-system”, pillared by a supportive government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore offers plenty of government initiatives and grants, led by the </span><span class="s3">National Research Foundation</span><span class="s1"> and official agencies, such as the </span><span class="s3">Media Development Authority</span><span class="s1"> and statutory boards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Startup Genome, the city state ranked 12th in the top 20 list of the world's start-up eco-systems in 2017, down two places from the previous year. Hong Kong wasn't even ranked, but Beijing and Shanghai are new entrants, at fourth and eighth respectively.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, heavy government backing can also work against entrepreneurship and commercialisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent survey of Singapore start-ups by the National University of Singapore's Entrepreneurship Centre found that while more than half of the tech firms survived past five years in business, they were still generating little growth or employment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 8.1 per cent of the 530 tech start-ups surveyed were considered “gazelles” - or high-growth firms that are increasing its revenue by 20 per cent annually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX, however, insists that government support is not its only edge over rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, it signed an agreement with the US's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> that will allow concurrent and sequential listings on both exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Loh calls that his “east-west corridor”, and that it's part of a wider strategy to draw more tech firms and start-up firms to list in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He dismissed, however, suggestions by the local media that Singapore simply provides a stepping stone to Asian firms who ultimately want to go public in the US, but have yet to qualify.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One can argue that it's easier to explain tech to investors outside the region, but you can also argue that you need to be able to explain Asia or Southeast Asia to investors from outside Asia,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The crux often lies in helping investors understand Asian business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Understanding how your model fits into distributing in Asia is equally important. You could then, because you are already Asian-focused, list on SGX first,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX is looking at prospects jointly with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, but Loh declined to give details or pin down a time when any debut listing might happen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange's engagement with techs and start-ups has also spilled into taking private stakes in some promising prospects.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange proposed revamping its listing rules last month to accommodate dual-class shareholding companies and biotech firms, without strong records of profitability, to avoid losing out on more IPOs by techs and new economy giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share firms must be worth at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) and have annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies with market caps of HK$10 billion or more that are already listed elsewhere will be eligible for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under their existing shareholding structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong gets set for a potential 600 billion yuan (HK$759 billion) asset management free-for-all on Wednesday when a mutual recognition scheme allows funds to be sold between the city and the mainland on equal terms for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Fung, executive director of Hang Seng Bank, said this cross-border initiative will help Hong Kong to develop as an Asian fund management hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"More mainland and foreign firms will set up shop or expand in Hong Kong as a result," Fung said. "This is not just adding fuel to the stock market. The mutual recognition scheme will also support commercial rentals and provide more job opportunities to young talent looking for a career in the fund industry," Fung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cross-border fund sales quota is even higher than the 550 billion yuan quota for the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which has been in operation since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-border schemes have played a major role in the stock rally. Beijing's April relaxation to allow mainland mutual funds invest in the Hong Kong market saw both Hong Kong and mainland stocks hit seven-year highs, with turnover surpassing all previous records.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another cross-border scheme is scheduled to link Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner at accounting firm EY, said these reforms will continue to benefit Hong Kong in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Connectivity to a bullish mainland market is generating energy in Hong Kong's markets," Pogson said. "Longer term, Hong Kong's challenge is to differentiate itself sufficiently from the mainland markets so as to remain the first choice for capital-raising and see to it that it does not lose out to the deeper liquidity sitting in the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong brokerage houses need to move nimbly and swiftly to address the new marketplace and ensure they stay alive and thrive."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx is planning to consult the market in the second half over a proposal to change the listing rules to allow companies with dual-share structures that give some shareholders more rights than others. However, last Thursday the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> publicly expressed its opposition to the current HKEx proposal. This has added uncertainty to the planned move.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This comes after the city lost e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s listing to the US in September as the local exchange refused to accommodate Alibaba's request for dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe Hong Kong needs to catch up with listing reforms to tap the IPO potential of mainland tech firms that are delisting in the US and returning home to take advantage of the higher valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers say Hong Kong would not be the choice of these companies without the necessary listing reforms. But some fund managers have voiced opposition to dual-class shares on the grounds of investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1">'s Fung also said Beijing has carried out several banking-related reforms. The State Council last week approved a draft amendment that removed the 75 per cent loan-deposit ratio, giving banks more freedom to lend. Saturday's decision by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to cut reserve requirements for some banks is aimed at helping to further boost liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These reforms will lead to further integration of the onshore and offshore interest rate markets," Fung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of financial firm Reorient, said the biggest impact could come from the launch of the China International Payment System in October. "This signifies one of the biggest steps for the development of China by having the first international yuan settlement system," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a settlement system in place, he said the globalisation of yuan would be well within reach.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has set its sights on becoming a wealth management centre for rich mainlanders, and will also diversify its income sources and expand the profile of new company listings, according to HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an exclusive interview with the South China Morning Post, Chow said HKEX has been very successful over the past 20 years in promoting initial public offerings but he conceded that the bourse is not diversified enough.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past five years, mainland companies accounted for 90 per cent of the funds raised, while over the past decade only 3 per cent of funds were raised by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The challenge ahead for the HKEX, like other stock exchanges, is to attract new economy firms to list here," Chow said. The bourse operator last Friday issued a consultation paper proposing establishment of a new third board with flexible regulations to attract start-ups and larger tech companies with dual shareholder structures, such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">. The new board, if it receives support from the market, would be launched in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX and the government is trying all efforts to fight for all mega IPOs, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> which will be the biggest IPO worldwide next year," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is the HKEX chief throwing caution to the wind with his New Economy dalliances?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098931/hkex-chief-throwing-caution-wind-his-new-economy-dalliances]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said another challenge for HKEX was to diversity its business which is why it wanted to expand into commodities through the acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metals Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Commodities represents 14 per cent of HKEX income now, up from nothing before the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> acquisition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Income from stocks represented 24 per cent of its total income in 2016, down from 56 per cent in 2000 when the HKEX was established through the merger of the stock and futures exchanges and their related clearing houses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has launched six metal products in Hong Kong and plans to add two gold contracts in July, while it is in the process of launching a commodities platform in Qianhai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is not easy to expand into the commodities market. However, since mainland China is the largest consumer of many commodities, the room for future growth in this area is huge. This will be a major development for the HKEX in future," Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX needs to diversify into commodities trading, clearing and other new business lines. Like any other commercial company, HKEX will be successful only if it can keep seeking out new business lines and new income," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual share class is a sore thumb in Hong Kong's new tech board[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098727/dual-share-class-sore-thumb-hong-kongs-new-tech-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opening up of China's capital market would remain the key to success for HKEX, which already has a solid track record as the preferred fund raising platform for Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the HK$3.269 trillion (US$420 billion) raised from new listings over the past 20 years, 78 per cent was from mainland firms, which showed the important role of Hong Kong as a fund raising centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow believes this role will continue under the New Silk Road initiative, in which China wants to work with 65 neighbouring countries to establish roads, railways, power plants and other infrastructure in coming years. The initiative is seen as boosting new listings and fund raising needs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another role for HKEX to play would be as a wealth management centre for mainlanders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is now the world's second largest economy and many mainlanders are getting wealthy and they have demands for investment. Hong Kong is a natural choice as we have the two stock connects to tie up with the bourses of Shanghai and Shenzhen... while the bond connect will develop this year," Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be more product launches at HKEX to fulfil the role as a wealth management centre for the mainlanders," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In reviewing the 20-year anniversary of the local bourse since the handover, Chow said HKEX "has come a long way and developed in a way that was better than expected".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total market capitalisation has risen eight-fold to HK$27 trillion now, up from HK$3 trillion in 1997, while average daily turnover stands at HK$82.1 billion compared with HK$15.5 billion at the handover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial sector now represents 18 per cent of Hong Kong's GDP, up from about 10.4 per cent 20 years ago.Since mainland China is the largest consumer of many commodities, the room for future growth in this area is hugeChow Chung-kong, HKEX chairman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also ranked as the world's No 1 IPO market from 2009 to 2011 as well as in 2015 and 2016, in terms of total funds raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow's only regret came in 2015 when the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the exchange proposal to launch a second consultation on dual class shares for Hong Kong. However, the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing supports the consultation launched last Friday because this time the proposal is for dual class shares structure firms traded on a new board, not trading on the market as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow added that it would be desirable if the government could play a more active role in helping the market find the right balance between market development and regulation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) is preparing to launch a second stage of consultation on weighted voting rights, in the third quarter of this year at the earliest, with an emphasis on higher governance standards for a small group of sizable listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The demand for a more stringent regulatory regime for companies wanting to use dual-share structures was bolstered by opposition to the proposal from a number of large international managers including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1">, BlackRock and </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">, who warned their introduction could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are considering proposing that, generally, 'one share-one vote' should prevail but that weighted voting rights structures should be allowed for certain companies in certain circumstances and with certain safeguards," David Graham, HKEx's chief regulatory officer and head of listing, said on Friday. "It is not our intention that such structures become commonplace in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he expected such structures would only be allowed for large, fast-growing, companies, and that one investor-protection proposal was to make compliance advisers permanent, rather than staying for a year when listing on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong, a director of brokerage KGI, said the investing public should be aware of the potential risks associated with companies that adopted a standard other than the "one share-one vote" principle since Hong Kong, unlike the US, did not allow class-action lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba dumped Hong Kong and opted for a New York listing last year, raising a record-breaking US$25 billion. The decision to list in the US was primarily due to Hong Kong's refusal to allow the company's request for dual-class shares and a partnership structure that would have allowed management to nominate a majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> said dual-class shareholding structures could reduce the alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders, a key "soft" protection in a low free-float market such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Gaud, senior portfolio manager at Edmond De Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters: "If Hong Kong is losing mandates to the US or in the future to Shanghai, it is good the situation is reviewed. But they would need to balance what they are giving away to the major shareholders, founders and promoters, by not forgetting about the minority shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx said institutional investors supportive of the proposal included </span><span class="s3">Norges Bank</span><span class="s1"> and CICC Hong Kong Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second-stage consultation will last for about three months.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology companies are knocking on the Hong Kong stock exchange's doors, making inquiries about raising capital under new listing rules, in a sign that the biggest overhaul of regulations by the bourse in three decades may be showing the desired effect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than 10 companies involved in e-commerce, online payments and biotechnology, mostly based in mainland China, have sought out information from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), according to the bourse operator's chairman Chow Chung Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These companies are asking for more information about our newly announced listing reforms, including the chance to list here under a dual-class shareholding structure,” Chow said in an interview with the South China Morning Post, without identifying any of them. “None of them have made a formal application, but they are interested to know more about our proposed rule changes.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flurry of interest, less than a fortnight after the HKEX unveiled its regulation change, appears to be a tentative, though preliminary, vindication of the push by the exchange to reinvent itself to compete with New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore for the global crown in initial public offerings (IPOs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will finish 2017 in third place in the global IPO stakes, with the funds raised falling 45 per cent to US$13.87 billion, the lowest since 2012, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York took the crown this year, with the capital raised more than doubling to US$29 billion, helped by blockbuster listings like the US$3.9 billion IPO by </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">, which operates the social media service Snapchat.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Part of the lure of New York is the allowance of multiple-class shares, or stocks with special voting rights for founders, to be listed. This practice, common among technology companies and start-ups from Baidu to </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, runs contrary to Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That obstacle prompted </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest e-commerce company and owner of the Post, to take its US$25 billion IPO to New York in 2014. For a large stock like Alibaba, nearly US$2.2 billion worth of shares changed hands everyday on average in the past year, almost a quarter of the total turnover of the entire Hong Kong exchange over the same period.</span></p>

HKEX, apart from being an exchange operator, is itself a listed company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial Services, and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi are all in the queue for IPOs. But the record breaker will probably be </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, with its US$100 billion IPO, based on a US$2 trillion valuation of the sovereign oil company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have tried our best effort to present Hong Kong as the best market for </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list,” Chow said. Chow and HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia were among the delegates with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor who visited Aramco's top officials two weeks ago, including energy minister Khalid Abdul Aziz al-Falih, as well as the kingdom's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter while China is the largest oil importer,” Chow said. “Hong Kong is the most international financial market in China.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/28/ac90a180-ebc6-11e7-8d3e-3515408466a8_image_hires_201242.JPG]To avoid missing out on the technology boom, HKEX and the city's securities regulator announced on December 15 that they would allow large technology companies with multiple classes of shares, as well as biotechnology companies with no revenue, raise capital in the city under new regulations. Companies that are already listed elsewhere would also be welcomed to seek out a secondary listing in Hong Kong, under the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of companies which made enquiries aimed at having a primary listing in Hong Kong, while a few want to check on information about a secondary listing,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even with a more relaxed set of listing regulations, the HKEX will maintain a proportionate degree of shareholders rights to protect minority investors. Snap, which gives its founder disproportionately more voting power than minority shareholders, would not qualify to list in Hong Kong, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to reclaim our No.1 spot, but we will never sacrifice our market's quality,” Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prospects for a Hong Kong listing this year for Chinese internet giant Alibaba have dimmed dramatically in the wake of disclosures by investment bankers that the mainland's No1 e-commerce firm is wrestling with how to keep management control after shares are sold to the public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources say the desire of chairman Jack Ma Yun to keep clear control of the company he founded in 1999 throws into doubt the likelihood of a Hong Kong share sale given strict listing rules that forbid dual structures that separate voting and ownership rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">People close to Ma, who founded Alibaba in his hometown of Hangzhou, said the teacher-turned-entrepreneur had planned to move forward quickly with the listing of his </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, but that sentiment had changed in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment on its plan for an initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources say Ma has been planning an IPO of shares in </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> since August last year, when he de-listed the flagship trade portal </span><span class="s3">Alibaba.com</span><span class="s1"> from the Hong Kong stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that would not happen if he could not keep control of the company, investment banking sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking into account Ma's personal 7.4 per cent stake in Alibaba, the entire management team owns a combined 10.4 per cent stake in the firm. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> owns 36.7 per cent and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, 24 per cent, according to official information released by the two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The most viable solution for Ma to maintain control over Alibaba's board may be to establish a mutual agreement with the two biggest shareholders, </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and SoftBank, who would agree to appoint Ma or his designated person to manage the company on a daily basis," said Edward Au, a Deloitte partner specialising in China listings. An agreement between Alibaba and its major investors </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and SoftBank is, however, easier said than done.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, Alibaba and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> had a very public dispute over Chinese electronic payments processing firm Alipay. The two parties later reached an agreement that Alibaba would get paid at least US$2 billion but no more than US$6 billion if Alipay goes public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alipay provides payment processing services to </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and its affiliates, including Taobao, a popular consumer-to-consumer portal on the mainland and widely considered one of the jewels of the Alibaba portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's current listing rules do not allow a so-called "dual class" voting structure as the US market does. The US system allows the management of a company to retain control through shares that have more voting power than publicly traded shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the New York listing of Manchester United last year, the Glazer family, which has owned the English football club since 2005, sold 42 per cent of its Class A shares to public investors, who would get only 1.3 per cent in terms of voting rights. Under the terms of that sale, Class B shares have 10 times more voting power than the publicly traded shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Glazer family had once considered listing in Hong Kong or Singapore before it picked New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some bankers with working ties with Ma said the Hong Kong securities regulator and the city's stock exchange might review and revise its existing listing rules to attract listings of technology firms such as Alibaba in the event of the US market unwinding the dual-class voting structure to cope with rising demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firms like Alibaba are often run by a group of founding members who own minority stakes due to seed investments by other investors during the start-up period, requiring special provisions for control by founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Should China's largest e-commence company succeed in hitting a market capitalisation of US$100 billion, it would rank as the third-largest internet firm behind US search giant </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, with a market cap of US$290 billion, and online retailer </span><span class="s3">Amazon. com</span><span class="s1">, at US$133 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing of Alibaba could easily run up to US$15 billion, which would be the biggest capital raising in the city this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now that the dust has settled on whether the Hong Kong stock exchange should grant Alibaba a special waiver to list dual-class shares, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia is stirring up the issue again. He kicks off his latest blog with: "Now that Alibaba has gradually faded from media attention, maybe our market can finally have a more rational and open discussion about weighted voting rights and our future competitiveness." The implication here is that the previous discussion, which resulted in Alibaba deciding to list in the United States rather than in Hong Kong, was somehow irrational.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li takes issue with the "one share, one vote principle" which he seems to think has wrongly been seen as the Hong Kong market's "core value". This, he argues, is not universally applied and ironically takes the case of HKEx which, although a listed company, the government gets to elect six of the 12 board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, Li thinks that rule of law and due process are the market's core values. They dictate that "we must not change our rules haphazardly for a single company and any significant change would need to go through due process. But on the other hand, due process does not dictate refusal to debate the future of our market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You can see where he is going with this. He makes the point that dual listings are permitted in the US, saying, "It is difficult to conclude that US regulators chose to allow the dual-class share regimes because they do not care about investor protection. The success to date by firms like </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> makes it difficult for us to conclude that US investors have lost out as a result of such structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share, one vote, he says, has a nice ring to it and, "if we only care about reputation, this approach will certainly help to maintain Hong Kong's nominal regularity purity". The corollary of being overly concerned with what he calls "regulatory purity" and persisting with a ban on dual shares is that China's technology and new economy companies will list in the US rather than Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If this becomes a trend, Hong Kong could lose a huge franchise for good, " he says, getting to the meat of his argument. This of course hurts competitiveness, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So for all the chat about having a rational debate, Li's discourse does not take the discussion any further and is a restatement of the view that if Hong Kong sticks to one share, one vote - this will affect the Hong Kong market's "competitive" position and will result in the loss of new China listings to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One aspect of the discussion he neatly avoids is that in the US, investors can use the class action system to obtain legal redress. This is not available in Hong Kong where the cost of legal action is usually not worth it. This is a huge difference which Li does not address. There is also the question of whether Li or the HKEx is the right body to be initiating this discussion. It has a huge vested interest in this matter, and as such is deeply conflicted. It's not unlike having a rabbit in charge of the lettuce patch. This topic shows no sign of going away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In harm's way</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jim Walker's Asianomics has come out with a cheery report that says Hong Kong's current positive economic demeanour is masking the tell-tale signs of a sharp and possibly unprecedented correction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is in the path of a typhoon developing on the mainland," Sharmila Whelan, an analyst with Asianomics, told The Telegraph. "A nasty downturn in China and a sudden sharp correction in the Hong Kong property market would severely buffet the territory's economy. China's problems have become insurmountable and the likelihood that 2014 will prove the year of reckoning is growing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The problem lies in the banking system, according to the report. Before the financial crisis, China had never represented more than 10 per cent of total external claims. Post-crisis, there has been a dramatic shift, with Hong Kong financial institutions' exposure to the mainland rising to 49 per cent. Much of this is from the offshore units of big mainland banks, which have been using the city as a base for sourcing foreign funding that is re-lent in the domestic economy. A real estate crisis on the mainland would have a serious impact on Hong Kong bank balance sheets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new board is among the measures </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) will consider in its bid to lure more technology start-ups to list on the city's bourse, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 343 companies to list in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013, only 22, or 6 per cent of the total, were technology related, according to HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to introduce a dual-shares structure on the grounds that it would violate the long-held principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-share structures, which allow shares with unequal voting rights to be listed, are popular with technology firms, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate had raged for years on the issue, but the topic was thrust into the spotlight two years ago when Chinese e-commerce juggernaut </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, opted to list its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Losing out on a listing by Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has been costly for the Hong kong exchange, financially and in terms of market development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Thursday, turnover of Alibaba shares was US$2.75 billion (HK$21.43 billion) - equivalent to almost a third of total Hong Kong stock market turnover of HK$65 billion on the same day. HKEX's turnover would get a significant boost from the increased trading fees, while brokers would benefit from higher commission income from these trades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised a record-breaking US$25 billion from its IPO in the US in 2014. Its decision to choose New York meant Hong Kong lost out that year as the world's largest IPO market. HKEX also missed out on an initial listing fee of HK$650,000 and an annual listing fee of HK$1.19 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No doubt these are among the factors that have prompted HKEX to examine ways of lowering the entry barriers for new tech companies wishing to float their stock here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should have a new board, or we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets for the new start-ups and innovation companies to list here,” Li said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments came as regional competition among bourses looking to attract a new generation of technology start-ups intensified.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bourse to study measures to attract more tech start-ups to raise funds in the city[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2012287/hong-kong-bourse-study-measures-attract-more-tech-start-ups-raise]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) on Monday won approval from its listing advisory committee to allow companies to list dual-shares structures, favoured by many start-ups as many of their founders hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It may be a necessary measure for Singapore's bourse, which has attracted few IPOs in recent years, but some analysts point out that the move is risky as up to 90 per cent of start-ups fail.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the US market has shown such structures can attract big tech players to list. The top 25 dual-share structure companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and LikedIn in the US have a combined market cap of US$927.42 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies, such as Baidu and Weibo, listed in the US, 29 of them have dual-class structures. Baidu's founder, for example, has only a 15.9 per cent stake in the company but has a voting right of 53.5 per cent.We will study whether we should have a new board or adopt a new disclosure regime for the new start-ups to list hereCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had wanted to list in Hong Kong in 2013 with a structure that would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate half of the board, but the dual-share arrangement has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in 2014 began consulting the market about the possibility of permitting dual-share structures here, but the exercise ground to a halt when the SFC opposed the idea, fearing it would undermine investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city is not lacking start-ups. They just choose not to raise funds through HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 2015 survey by </span><span class="s3">InvestHK</span><span class="s1"> reported a 46 per cent increase in the total number of start-ups to 1,558 compared with 1,065 in 2014. Hong Kong is now home to more than 10 accelerator and incubation programmes, ranging in scope from financial technology to healthcare, run by large corporations including </span><span class="s3">Accenture</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board's requirement for HK$50 million in profit in the three years ahead of a listing is considered to be too high for start-ups, as is the Growth Enterprise Market's stipulation of a cash flow of HK$20 million in the previous two years of operation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma told University of Macau students in June that he “very much hopes” to list Ant Financial Services, the operator of Alipay, in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government supports plans by the city's stock exchange to launch a new platform to attract technology and new economy companies to list, according to a minister.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Attracting high quality companies to list in Hong Kong is important to the future development of the Hong Kong capital market,” Chan Ka Keung, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We support the stock exchange in its plans to review local listing rules and to launch a new platform to attract more technology or new economy companies. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will work together to study these issues,” Chan told media after he hosted the opening ceremony at the exchange to mark the first trading day of Year of the Rooster.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last month the local bourse would this year conduct a consultation to launch a third board, with more relaxed regulations than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, to attract technology and new economy companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is the world's largest initial public offering market worldwide based on total funds raised in the past two years. However, the listings are heavily biased towards financial firms, which accounted for 69 per cent of funds raised last year, while tech firms accounted for only 3 per cent, according to a report by consulting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compromise is likely outcome of Hong Kong listing reform as opposing camps stand firm</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said at Wednesday's exchange ceremony that the SFC would jointly work with the HKEX to study the project. In 2015 the commission rejected the exchange's proposal to allow dual class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong on the grounds that such structures did not offer sufficient shareholder protection. Many new economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> use dual class structures which allow a class of shareholders, usually the founders, to have more rights than other shareholders. The US allows such structures but Hong Kong has banned them since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will support the exchange to reform the market to attract more new listings while at same time we want to make sure market quality would be maintained,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would also enforce regulations for the GEM market which has seen the share prices of many new listings rise or drop substantially soon after listing. The SFC and HKEX last month jointly issued guidelines that required listing sponsors to make sure their GEM offerings were done appropriately in order to avoid such volatility. Some brokers said the new guidelines didn't go far enough and urged the regulators to increase the number of minimum shareholders of GEM companies from 100 to 300, matching requirement of the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Turf war between Hong Kong regulators escalates as HKEX director opposes listing reform</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will review the GEM rules in a consultation paper. We will be open-minded to market comments. However, it should be noted that even if we raised the bar from 100 to 300 for the minimum shareholders of GEM offerings, some people may still find a way to circumvent the rule. The SFC will continue to enforce the regulation to ensure the market quality,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the controversial listing reform has received several thousand comments and the SFC and stock exchange are reviewing the comments before making a conclusion. Last June the SFC and HKEX launched a market consultation on proposals to change listing approval procedures to give the SFC a more front line role in setting listing policies and approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals drew opposition from some listed companies and brokers who worried about giving too much power to the SFC but government officials and a former SFC head supported the reform, believing it would enhance market transparency and efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments are not a simple ‘yes' or ‘no'. While some support the changes, some are totally opposed to it. Some have different views on different proposals in the paper. We are working on them now and it will take time. The SFC still believes the reform will enhance market transparency and efficiency,” Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange will face mounting competition from Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, as speedier listing approval process and strong demand from investors expected next year will help them to extend their top rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its annual IPO review and outlook for 2018, EY laid out the prediction based on the number of IPOs and proceeds raised this year - 436 companies mopped up 230.4 billion yuan (US$35.1 billion) from the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These represent an increase of 92 per cent in number and 53 per cent in proceeds compared to 2016, and make the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges the top two respectively in number of IPOs completed this year. Hong Kong was ranked third, with a total of 160 IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in terms of proceeds raised, the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked top in 2017, with US$39.5 billion, followed by Shanghai at US$20.9 billion; and Hong Kong at US$16.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the number of A-share IPOs reached a record high, a lack of IPO that raised over 5 billion yuan per deal also means that all these IPOs' proceeds raised combined was just 47 per cent the total amount raised in 2010, which was the second biggest year for IPOs in numbers at 347.There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listedRingo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, “there were 508 companies [as of December 22] waiting in the pipeline to have their IPOs approved by the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">,” said Ringo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY. “There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said the A-share IPO market became more “normalised” as 2017 progressed, with an average of 30-40 IPOs completed per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, a record 160 IPOs were completed, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Combined they raised HK$128.2 billion (US$16.5 billion), down however by 34 per cent from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to EY, a lack of large IPOs also squeezed total funds raised in Hong Kong. But more significantly, a record 80 companies got listed on GEM board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bullish performance of the Hang Seng Index, which has gained 34 per cent this year and ranked first among major indices including </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Dow Jones Industrial Average, has benefited the IPO market, Choi said, adding that 28 overseas companies were also attracted to list in Hong Kong, the highest in six years, raising a total of HK$10.02 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“New listing rules to be introduced in 2018 for allowing listing of dual-class share structure on the main board; and the proposal to increase the minimum expected market capitalisation of main board applicants to HK$500 million from HK$200 million are all positive for the Hong Kong IPO market for the first half,” Choi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, for the second half he was more cautious. Apart from uncertainty about whether investors would still continue to favour equities like they did in 2017, Choi noted competition from the two exchanges in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expected that as A-share IPO vetting process accelerates with simpler approval procedures, this might erode the attraction of the Hong Kong bourse as these companies might opt for a listing on the mainland because of the attractive pricing levels that can be achieved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For 2018, he expects IPOs in Hong Kong to raise HK$150 billion, but a mega IPO, such as that by listing hopeful Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco, will bring the total to over HK$200 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Alibaba drums up its initial public offering in the US, there will be increasing expressions of regret about Hong Kong giving up the big cake in return for upholding its "one share, one vote" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is indeed big. Despite a slowdown in its growth, the e-commerce giant's valuation is still estimated at US$200 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some are gritting their teeth, the big question to ask is what would Hong Kong have had to sacrifice to keep Alibaba's IPO here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Judging from the corporate structure detailed in its filing made to the US regulators, the sacrifice would have been too big to bear.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a governance structure that will not only give Jack Ma Yun and the 26 Alibaba partners control over the board but also one that has zero chance of changing unless their stake drops below 5 per cent. The partners can kick Ma and chief executive Joe Tsai out of the partnership … the reality is, however, more complicated</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To Ma, it means being able to cash in 40 per cent of his 8.9 per cent holding if needed without compromising his control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is how it's structured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's article of association states that the Alibaba Partnership, which holds 13.9 per cent, will nominate a simple majority of directors for shareholders to vote on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will be a sure win because both SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> - holding 34.4 per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively - have agreed to vote along the same lines as the partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course there is a good chance that SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> will eventually sell down. Their relationship with Ma has been far from cordial ever since 2011 when Ma pocketed Alipay - a payment service processor - from Alibaba behind their backs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Ma has no need to worry. In case of a change in control of the company and the new shareholders rejecting directors nominated by the partnership, the partners will simply install some interim directors until the next annual shareholders' meeting. So on and so forth. This arrangement will not be changed unless 95 per cent of the shareholders agree to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is not about control by Ma, Alibaba said, rather to preserve the culture shaped by the founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in the hands of a few founders, the company said this approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be fair, Ma is not dominating, at least on paper. Various hurdles are put in place to give the partnership arrangement a rule-by-majority look.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the partners decide their director nominations by a simple majority vote. It even specifies that the partners can kick Ma and chief executive Joe Tsai out of the partnership with a simple majority vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reality is, however, more complicated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A partnership committee, comprising Ma, Tsai and three executives, decides three important things. One, who qualifies as partners. Two, who is to be nominated as director. Three, it makes recommendations to independent directors on each executive partner's share of cash rewards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While no one will be stupid enough to go against him, Ma and the incumbent committee members can seek re-election for an unspecified time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the way, Ma and Tsai have also been exempted from retiring from the partnership, even when they are no longer employees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given his firm control, it is therefore not surprising that Ma sees no need to get a first right of refusal from SoftBank and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> in any future sell down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba conceded that "this governance structure and contractual arrangement will limit shareholders' ability to influence corporate matters, including any matters determined at the board level".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faith is the key. No wonder Alibaba compares its partners to "evangelists" in preaching its "mission, vision and values, both within our organisation and externally to customers, business partners and other participants in our ecosystem".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is perhaps why Alibaba has been able to provide scant details on certain crucial matters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is the mystery over who owns the remaining 20 per cent of Alibaba and whether they are selling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2012, Alibaba announced the issue of new shares to some investors. Among them were the country's sovereign wealth fund and Boyu Investment, a private equity firm set up by the grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin. No specifics have ever been given.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then, there is the uncertainty over how exactly Ma is going to ensure the company's interest in various related-party transactions with him. Among them is Alipay, which provides payment services to Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a written commitment, Ma said he "intends" to reduce his economic interest in Alipay over time to a percentage that does not exceed his ownership in Alibaba. He also promised that he would make no economic gain from that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just how reassuring is this expression of intent?</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Barrister Laurence Li Lu-jen is the front runner to head Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council, according to two people familiar with the situation, succeeding Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who recently became first woman to head the stock market operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143577/laura-cha-checks-hong-kong-exchanges-first-woman-chief-its-127]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143577/laura-cha-checks-hong-kong-exchanges-first-woman-chief-its-127]The FSDC was set up by Hong Kong's former chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, as an advisory body to conduct research into improving the competitiveness of the city's financial market and promoting it in international financial circles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, 47 and a finance and banking specialist, had joined Cha to help establish the FSDC in 2013 and is currently the convenor of its research committee. He has also worked at the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), the market regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Li was the one who helped Cha to set up the council. He is the most suitable candidate for the post,” one of the sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to comment on any appointment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Whoever would become the chairman of FSDC, he or she would need to promote fintech and innovation in Hong Kong. The FSDC would also need to propose more measures to enhance investor protection,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li had led an FSDC report in 2014 on how to improve the IPO system, including a call for Hong Kong to follow London to launch different boards for different companies to attract innovative companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FSDC proposes specialised listing boards in wake of Alibaba IPO loss[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1535838/fsdc-proposes-specialised-listing-boards-wake]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report came in the wake of a decision by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to list in New York instead of Hong Kong, sparking debate in the city over its rigid listing rules. That debate ultimately led to HKEX unveiling the largest listing reform in 25 years in April, which among other measures allowed dual-class shareholding companies like Alibaba to list, as well as biotech firms that have yet to record any revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said it would be good if a new FSDC chairman focused on investor protection and fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform of the HKEX has successfully attracted large technology firms such as [Chinese mobile phone giant] Xiaomi to come here to list. The next major focus would be on investor protection - there are still corporate governance problems in Hong Kong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The FSDC and other regulators should make more proposals to clean up the market to attract investors to trade here,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li spent six years at the SFC between 1999 and 2005, while Cha was the regulator's vice-chairman. Before joining the SFC, Li practised US corporate tax law at the New York head office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li is also a member of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Urban Renewal Authority</span><span class="s1"> and a member of the Social Welfare Advisory Committee. He also serves as a judge on the Regulatory Tribunal of the Qatar Financial Centre.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next stop after the stock "through train" scheme could be commodities as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> looks towards tie-ups with mainland futures exchanges after the proposed collaboration with the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We'll need to focus on working out the details in establishing our link with the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in the next few months. In future, it would be possible for us to have more tie-ups with other mainland exchanges. We are not ruling out similar linkages with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> or futures exchanges across the border," HKEx chairman Chow Chung-kong said after the annual general meeting of the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and mainland regulators last week announced a through-train scheme to begin in October that will allow investors from the city and the mainland to cross-trade stocks listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong up to a quota of 550 billion yuan (HK$691 billion). The quota has no time frame and Beijing has not said if it will replenish the quota after it runs out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx and the Shanghai exchange will soon sign the agreement. Under it, mainland investors looking to trade Hong Kong stocks can do so through mainland brokers, who will place the orders at the Shanghai exchange that will then be passed on to the HKEx. Those in Hong Kong investing in mainland stocks will do the reverse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors can trade up to 10.5 billion yuan of Hong Kong stocks a day, or 250 billion yuan in total, while Hong Kong investors can trade up to 13 billion yuan of Shanghai stocks a day, up to 300 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the HKEx annual general meeting yesterday, some small shareholders asked about the possibility of listing reforms after the exchange lost e-commerce giant Alibaba's initial public offering to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to look for another listing venue after it failed to convince the Securities and Futures Commission and the exchange in October to allow it to list with a share structure that would give its founders and the top management more control of the board despite holding minorities stakes. The US allows such dual-class share structures but Hong Kong does not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's listing committee is studying the issue while HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wrote in his blog about the need to take a fresh look at the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But institutional investors are opposed to any changes in existing rules. A survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association on Tuesday showed most are against any changes to the listing rules and want the one-share-one-vote principle to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before we make any changes to our rules, we would need to have a consultation to gauge the market view," Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates the third largest stock market in Asia, on Wednesday reported better-than-expected net profit of HK$7.4 billion (US$950 million) for 2017, up 28 per cent year on year, on the back of higher market turnover and record number of new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This beat the consensus forecast of a 27 per cent profit growth to HK$7.34 billion, according to a </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> poll of analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results also marked the second best year ever, behind the HK$7.96 billion earned in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earning per share stood at HK$6.03, up 27 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said it would pay a final dividend of HK$2.85 per share, bringing the full-year dividend to HK$5.4, up 27 per cent from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's shares fell 1.31 per cent to close the morning session at HK$286 before the results announcement during the lunch break.The bourse operator's shares have risen almost 49 per cent in the past 12 months, making it the 10th best performer on the Hang Seng Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fourth-quarter profit stood at HK$1.87 billion, up 51 per cent than a year, according to calculations by the Post, which also beat analysts' forecast of HK$1.85 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In Hong Kong, we witnessed a bullish securities market especially in the fourth quarter of 2017 when the average daily turnover reached HK$107.3 billion,” HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong said in the results statement. Chow will step down in April after serving in the post for six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher stock market turnover helped deliver a 38 per cent annual increase in trading fee income at HK$1.95 billion. The average daily turnover last year stoodat HK$88.2 billion, up 32 per cent from HK$66.9 billion in 2016, but still below the HK$105.6 billion in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April 2015, China allowed mutual funds to invest in Hong Kong stock market via the stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai, which has boosted turnover up to an average HK$200 billion per day. Turnover, however, went down after the mainland markets' slump in mid 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It rose again in 2017 as mainland investors increased their investment in Hong Kong equities after the launch of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The northbound and southbound trading through the two stock connect grew significantly last year, increasing by 194 per cent and 170 per cent respectively from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their investment now represents almost 10 per cent of the daily turnover, which helped to drive the Hang Seng Index up 36 per cent last year, making it the world's best performing benchmark.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fees, a major source of income, rose 8 per cent last year to HK$828 million, as a record 174 companies launched IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, since there were no blockbuster floats, the total funds raised dropped 34 per cent to HK$128.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow, however, warned on risks ahead, as stock markets worldwide have seen intense volatility in the first two months of this year, adding that impending US interest rate increases and US tax reforms pose challenges to global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The world is also moving into a new era of new economy businesses and technology innovations, and the financial markets are facing a landscape filled with both opportunities and challenges,” Chow said, adding the exchange is in the midst of listing reforms to capture these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange last Friday announced that it would bring forward listing reforms from June to late April, and would start accepting listing applications from biotech companies without revenue or giant new-economy companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, which has led analysts from Citi and CICC to view the developments positively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will meet the media and analysts later on Wednesday afternoon to provide an update on the exchange's development plans.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FAST FACTS:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• GDP to grow 3 to 4 per cent this year</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• Fiscal reserves expected to reach HK$1.092 trillion</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$138 billion fiscal surplus; 40 per cent to be spent on relief measures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$50 billion in tax breaks; reductions on salaries and profits tax, rates</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$50 billion for innovation and technology development</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• HK$2,000 one-off cash handout for poor students</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• No tax waiver on electric cars but drivers get subsidised one-for-one replacement scheme, capped at HK$250,000</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">• One-off allowance to ‘N-nothings' makes comeback</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A budget with a clear eye on the future and massive expenditure to alleviate people's burdens - these were the twin pledges from Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po as he set out the Hong Kong government's spending blueprint with a record surplus of HK$138 billion (US$17.7 billion) as its centrepiece.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A chunk of the bounty, more than HK$50 billion, will be shared with at least 2 million Hongkongers - mostly through targeted tax reliefs, rate waivers and beefed-up allowances. And in an even-handed gesture, he pledged to invest the same amount on hi-tech development to transform the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current-term government is ready to think out of the box and act proactively to open up new horizons for Hong Kong,” Chan[http://www.scmp.com/topics/paul-chan] declared, as he delivered his first budget under the Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] administration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Riding on 3.8 per cent growth last year, Chan's forecast growth this year isas high as 4 per cent, with headline inflation kept at bay at 2.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The massive surplus - almost 8.5 times the amount projected in the last budget[http://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-budget-2017-2018] - also broke the 2007-08 record of HK$123.7 billion to become the biggest since the 1997 handover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This also increased fiscal reserves to an estimated HK$1.092 trillion by end-March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In delivering the budget, Chan, unlike his predecessor, took pains to show he was aligned with his boss' thinking, as he explained her “new fiscal philosophy” of optimising the surplus to invest in the future and relieve people's needs. “I agree entirely with her view,” he told the Legislative Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial secretary said he aimed to develop Hong Kong into a more diversified economy and highlighted innovation and technology as a major new growth driver that the city could not afford to lag behind in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The unstoppable wave of innovation and technology has swept through the world, fundamentally changing the global economic structure and the way we live and consume,” Chan said, as he presented an extra HK$50 billion in funding to boost IT development, on top of the HK$10 billion already reserved in last year's budget.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the new money, some HK$20 billion will be used on the development of the planned Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park in the border area of the Lok Ma Chau Loop. Some HK$10 billion will be injected into the Innovation and Technology Fund to support the establishment of research centres for health care technologies, artificial intelligence and robotics technologies, according to Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also proposed allocating HK$10 billion to Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks for it to boost research infrastructure and support for incubatees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In all these initiatives, Chan made clear the close link between the city's economy and that of the mainland. Noting that China now contributed more than 30 per cent to the global economy, he said the mainland's strategies have not only a global bearing but “are also the linchpin of Hong Kong's sustained prosperity”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To attract leading overseas and mainland internet enterprises and fintech companies to set up offices and research units in Hong Kong, Chan proposed HK$200 million in funding to Cyberport to enhance its support for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in a move to reform the stock exchange, he said that dual class share listings will be in place in the second quarter this year, potentially paving the way for listings by tech and biotech start-ups eager to be anchored in Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To take advantage of the mainland's growing economy, Chan asked the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to set up an academy of finance to train the city's talent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the domestic front, while Chan did not heed the public's calls for handouts, the measures he rolled out came up to 40 per cent of the surplus. They include a salaries tax rebate of up to 75 per cent, with a cap of HK$30,000, widening the tax bands, a 20 per cent rise in tax allowances for families with children, as well as rates waivers of up to HK$2,500 a quarter, and extra social security payments to the needy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in line with his boss's fiscal philosophy, Chan departed from the past “small government” policy of keeping public spending at not more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product. Instead, he aimed to push the level to “slightly higher than 21 per cent” of GDP in the next few years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 20 per cent cap was meant to avoid overexpansion of the government, but Chan argued: “Today, while acknowledging the forces and roles of the market, we have to be more proactive in managing public finances in the face of various development needs of society and the economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked later at a TV forum why he rejected calls for distributing cash to the people, Chan said he liked the relief measures to be aimed more specifically at the lower-income class.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan was made financial secretary early last year after his predecessor John Tsang Chun-wah[http://www.scmp.com/topics/john-tsang] quit the post to join the chief executive race, despite Beijing's apparent preference for Lam. Chan, who delivered his maiden budget last February, was picked by Lam to be finance chief in her administration, though it was widely reported he was not her first choice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The budget Chan delivered last year was mainly based on a nearly finalised draft prepared by Tsang. Wednesday's was widely seen as the first blueprint of his as well as Lam's philosophy on public financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his speech, a more confident-looking Chan, compared to last year, said his budget strategies also aimed to take care of the long-term needs of society and enhance health care and social welfare services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On health care, Chan noted the government had increased its recurrent expenditure by an average of 7 per cent over the past decade. Spending on public health care services will increase by 13.3 per cent to HK$71.2 billion in 2018-19, accounting for 17.5 per cent of total recurrent expenditure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An additional recurrent funding of nearly HK$6 billion will be allocated to the Hospital Authority in 2018-19 to increase the number of beds, operating theatre sessions and manpower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The limit on Elderly Health Care Vouchers will also be raised by HK$1,000 to HK$5,000 in 2018, which will involve expenditure of about HK$796 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also proposed to establish a HK$500 million fund to promote the development of Chinese medicine by providing support in areas such as applied research and knowledge exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To support the second 10-year hospital development plan, HK$300 billion would be set aside as an initial provision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The finance chief also set aside HK$20 billion for the improvement and development of cultural facilities, and another HK$500 million for the acquisition of museum collections and holding exhibitions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On education, Chan also planned to increase recurrent expenditure by another HK$2 billion, on top of the HK$5 billion that Lam already pledged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the extra spending will be aimed at achieving quality education, through enhancing the professional development of teachers, strengthening support for kindergartens, and supporting schools in enhancing the promotion of life-wide learning, or education in real-life settings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan proposed to allocate some HK$504 million to launch a three-year pilot scheme to provide social work services in phases for about 150,000 children and their families in all aided childcare centres, kindergartens and kindergarten-cum-childcare centres.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also promised more resources from the 2018-19 school year to achieve “one social worker for each school”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There will also be a one-off grant of HK$2,000 to each student in need to support learning, involving an expenditure of about HK$740 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Largely following the footsteps of his predecessor, Chan offered a number of one-off “sweeteners” to ease the burdens of taxpayers and the needy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition to higher tax allowances for children and dependent parents and grandparents, there will also be tax rebates of 75 per cent for salaries taxpayers, with the cap being lifted by 50 per cent from last year to HK$30,000. That is expected to benefit some 1.88 million taxpayers and see tax revenue reduced by HK$22.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For landlords, property rates will be waived for four quarters of 2018-19, subject to a ceiling of HK$2,500 per quarter for each property. That is estimated to benefit 3.25 million properties and reduce government revenue by HK$17.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And there will be two extra months' pay to recipients of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance or Disability Allowance. That will involve an additional expenditure of about HK$7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government will also set aside HK$15 billion for arrangements for offsetting severance payments or long service payments against Mandatory Provident Fund contributions - almost doubling the HK$7.9 billion proposed previously by Lam's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying[http://www.scmp.com/topics/leung-chun-ying-0]. Details of the new mechanism are expected to be released soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese Manufacturers' Association welcomed the budget measures but said the HK$15 billion the government set aside for the MPF offsetting mechanism was “still some distance away” from what the business sector had expected. It urged the government to increase its financial commitment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his speech, Chan noted that the property boom had resulted in land premiums increasing by HK$62.6 billion to HK$163.6 billion, or 62 per cent higher than estimated, but he did not touch much on cooling the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He only urged caution, saying the “key factors underpinning soaring property prices over the past few years are gradually undergoing fundamental changes”, citing the increased supply and possible US rate hikes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The private sector will, on average, produce about 20,800 residential units annually in the coming five years [from 2018 to 2022], an increase of 50 per cent over the annual average in the past five years,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides, as at end-December 2017, the projected supply from the first-hand private residential property market in the next three to four years will remain at a high level of about 97,000 units.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Besides, as the US interest rate normalisation process continues, the ultra-low interest rate environment of the past few years will no longer persist.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sharmaine Lau Yuen-yuen, chief economic analyst at mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services, expressed disappointment that Chan had not come up with measures to cool the market or help people own homes. She urged the government to ease the loan-to-value ratio to 90 per cent for flats priced up to HK$8 million to help first-time buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, possibly to help Lam honour her promise that there would be “surprises” in the budget, put forward some unexpected measures, including giving out 10,000 free tickets to primary and secondary students to Ocean Park, and HK$2 billion to expedite installation of lifts in schools, and HK$100 million for the promotion of e-sport.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung criticised Chan for failing to roll out any plans to address the income gap problem. “One-off relief measures cannot solve any deep-rooted social problems,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenny Shui Chi-wai, senior researcher at the policy think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation, welcomed the government's move to inject resources into innovation and technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Shui said the government should also increase funding for university research so as to “consolidate the world-class status of local universities and continue to train local talents”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stands out as the preferred market for raising capital among China's most valuable companies, according to a survey that vindicates last year's overhaul in the city's stock listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four out of every 10 so-called unicorns[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2110209/who-has-most-unicorns-china-or-us] identified Hong Kong as the preferred market for an initial public offering (IPO), according to a </span><span class="s3">PricewaterhouseCooper</span><span class="s1"> survey of 101 of these companies, each with at least US$1 billion in valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US stock markets come in second at 25 per cent, followed by China's yuan-denominated A-share market in third place with 23 per cent, according to the survey of C-suite executives including founders and chairmen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is the preferred capital market partly due to the latest tweaks in its listing measures, including the support for biotechnology companies and dual-class structures, reflecting the determination to embrace the new economy by the stock exchange,” said Gao Jianbin, PwC's leader for China technology, media and telecommunications leader, in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey is the latest vindication for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which last year pushed through a controversial overhaul of the city's listing regulations along with the securities regulator. The amendments, the most extensive in three decades, were to help the bourse regain its pole position as the world's largest market for fundraising, after losing the 2017 crown to New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expanded listing reforms in progress, says HKEX chairman[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139938/expanded-listing-reforms-progress-says-hkex-chairman]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes have paid off, as the exchange awaits the US$6.1 billion listing next week by Xiaomi the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker. </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, the world's fourth-most valuable technology start-up at US$60 billion, is also filing to raise funds in the city.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flurry of new listings this year will help Hong Kong claw its way back to the top three spots in global IPO rankings, from the fifth rank during the first half, PWC's rival Deloitte said earlier.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To compete, China's securities regulator has shown that it can fast track IPO applicants in a matter of days, instead of the typical two-year wait. The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">is also rolling out a class of Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) to allow domestic investors to partake in the offshore listings of Chinese companies, opening up an additional avenue to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, some unicorns will wait and see the results of real listings before making the decision to jump into the CDR fray, Gao said. Xiaomi, which was supposed to be the pioneer for the CDR programme, last week postponed its CDR plan, marking a setback for the Chinese government's overtures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Questions remain as countdown begins on depositary receipts with Chinese characteristics[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2151293/questions-remain-countdown-begins-depositary-receipts-chinese]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also enjoys the advantage of being an established capital market and global financial centre, complete with transparent and predictable procedures and rule of law, Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey found that 64 per cent of the companies have a listing plan in the next two years and 21 per cent called it an urgent task. About 75 per cent of the respondents have been running business for less than eight years while the remaining ones have been in operation within four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the survey, unicorn companies listed talents drainage and disruption on capital chain as the two biggest potential challenges or crisis they are concerned about.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is itself a publicly listed company, its stock rising by almost 19 per cent in the past 12 months.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HK revamps listing rules in battle for global tech giants -- SCMP headline, December 16</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This latest attempt by Hong Kong's stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to destroy shareholder democracy has an offhand way of dismissing his earlier, overly ambitious attempt to do away with all significant listing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That earlier concept paper in 2015 was only a “straw man”, says this latest concept paper; meaning, I take it, that it was an intentionally false proposal we were meant to knock down, so as to make it easier to introduce the real one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oh, thank you, Charles. So kind of you to waste our time. How very thoughtful of you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the real one (let's hope it's not just another straw man this time) does have one brand new idea: it is to allow listing by “pre-revenue” biotech companies, as long as they have a “minimum expected market capitalisation” of HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I shall ask the obvious question for you: If they are not yet selling anything, leave alone turning any profit, on what basis can the market be “expected” to value them?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Perhaps we could try the old Roman way of dealing with such eventualities. Take a live chicken, cut it open on the spot and then call in a soothsayer to tell you what the entrails forecast. It worked for the Romans apparently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new concept paper's version of this idea is to say there “tends to be” strict regulation of activities undertaken by biotech companies, and this should be enough. If it's good enough to swallow, then it's worth at least HK$1.5 billion, you see.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We had an example of such tends-to-be strict regulation only last week, when a doctor at a beauty shop was convicted of manslaughter by administering untested biotech quack remedies. It's a big industry. Just look at its tsunami of advertisements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Let's face it. This town has a weakness for biobabble. Talk a fast line in biotech and the customers will always line up. No one understands a word of it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then we get Charles back to his one-track mindset of WVR, or weighted voting rights. Our principle of “One Share, One Vote” is to be abandoned for “new economy” companies. All shareholders are equal, but some will be more equal than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong can now join the international race for the bottom in listing standards, while the cash-out price of Charles' share options - remember that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd</span><span class="s1"> is a listed company, whose shares are trading near a record - can race for the top.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But I mustn't spread falsehoods. It is not true that ordinary shareholders will be deprived of all voting rights in WVR companies. As long as their votes don't matter, they can have a few. Maybe they can butter them and have them for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And again, of course, we get no definition of what the “new economy” is. It is “hard to define”, “not necessarily restricted to specific sectors”, “likely to evolve over time” and “the Exchange proposes to publish a guidance letter”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any investment banker can find his way round such non-restrictions. WVR will therefore apply to the entire market from now on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The oddity here is that recent events have made nonsense of the supposed purpose of attracting more technology listings. They have come anyway. There has been a flood of them over the last few months, as high tech, and devoid of earnings, as any mindless follower of investment fashion could want.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also worth noting that WVR does not really make a stock more attractive to the professionals. In the US, for instance, both the S&amp;P and the MSCI indices have recently announced they will not accept shares with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This matters. The MSCI indices in particular are benchmarks for institutional investors. To have your stock included in any of them is to attract big time investor interest. To be permanently excluded because of your share structure now constitutes a self-induced banishment to second class.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So why do it?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There must be some legitimate reason. I cannot imagine that every corporate chieftain who asks for a WVR listing does it only because he wants to have his cake and eat it too, and is happy to rob his shareholders in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As I say, there must be a defensible reason. But don't ask me what it is.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company, also known as Ping An Good Doctor, has launched its highly anticipated Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) which aims to raise as much as HK$8.77 billion (US$1.12 billion) in what could become the city's biggest flotation by an internet-based business since ZhongAn Online's blockbuster IPO last September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing, which has already triggered an increase in Hong Kong's liquidity demand, is expected to ignite investor enthusiasm and become the catalyst for a strong potential pipeline of blockbuster new-economy IPOs this year, including star names such as Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed tech listing rule changes, set to be revealed on Tuesday, are also expected to facilitate a rash of dual-class share listings by tech and biotech companies that have yet to make profits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to use the [IPO] proceeds to expand our business, and fund future domestic and overseas acquisitions,” said Wang Tao, the medical service app's chairman and chief executive officer, on Sunday in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company plans to sell 160.094 million shares at an indicative price range of HK$50.8-$54.8 (US$6.48-6.99) per share, raising between HK$8.13 billion and HK$8.77 billion - which would be the city's most valuable this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If priced at the top, it could also become the largest flotation by an internet business since ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance raised HK$11.9 billion last September, in Hong Kong's biggest fintech listing ever.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/23/b779b118-462a-11e8-ab09-36e8e67fb996_image_hires_114409.jpg] Retail investors will be offered 6.5 per cent, or 10.4 million shares, with the rest targeted at international institutional investors, who have shown an “enthusiastic” response, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edmond Hui, chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Bright Smart Securities, also expects the stock to receive a hot response from the public, given its “new economy” nature.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It will reignite investor enthusiasm for IPOs, as the market anticipates more [new economy listings] to come,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail proportion will be offered from Monday to Thursday, with shares expected to start trading on the main exchange on May 4.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Hong Kong brokerages have already allowed retail investors to pre-register bids for the new stock using margin loans, including Bright Smart Securities, </span><span class="s3">Haitong International</span><span class="s1">, Phillip Securities, Prudential Brokerage, and Celestial Asia Securities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far, they have received pre-registrations worth some HK$63 billion, according to information available from the firms, reflecting a possible oversubscription of more than 100 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spin-off of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, Good Doctor is currently China's largest online health care and medical platform by user numbers. At the end of 2017, it had 193 million registered users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company posted a 2017 loss of 1 billion yuan (US$158.86 million), its third annual loss, but Lee Yuansiong, deputy chief executive officer for </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, said that is normal for a tech “unicorn” in its early phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Unicorns usually have four phases - building scenarios, obtaining traffic, generating revenue, and generating profit,” Lee said. “Good Doctor is still in the obtaining users and traffic phase.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group and Good Doctor will cooperate closely on businesses in future and that he was optimistic on the latter's outlook.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through its in-house medical team and partnerships with external hospitals and pharmacy outlets, Good Doctor offers four major online services - family doctors, consumer health care, health management and wellness interaction - as well as an online health mall where shoppers can buy medicine and medical devices.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citi Group and </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> are acting as the joint sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the prospectus, around 40 per cent of the net proceeds will be used for business expansion, such as its e-commerce business, hiring sales and medical professionals, acquiring new users and funding marketing activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just under a third will be allocated to funding potential investments or acquisitions at home and abroad, a fifth will go on research and development, while the rest will be for working capital and general corporate purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">British technology company Sage Group is planning to expand its business in Hong Kong and China where it hopes to tap the vast number of small and medium-sized firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision of the FTSE 100 management software business to open an office in Hong Kong as it seek further expansion opportunities comes amid a push by the city's regulators to attract global technology companies to operate and list here.China and Hong Kong together have 50 million small and medium-sized companies, which is more than 50 per cent of the world's total. They are the target clients of SageKerry Agiasotis, executive vice-president, Sage Asia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government has urged financial regulators including the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> and the Insurance Authority to do more to promote the fintech industry. Meanwhile the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> is working with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to carry out the biggest listing reforms in three decades in a bid to attract large biotech and other technology firms with multiple classes of shares to float here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The purpose is to help the city, traditionally strong in finance and trading, to catch up with the US and other markets in developing new technology sectors and supporting start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such efforts have started to yield some fruit, with some established firms deciding to come here. In October, the Swiss firm </span><span class="s3">Avaloq</span><span class="s1">, which supplies cloud-based solutions to big banks such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, said it was eyeing expansion in Hong Kong and China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sage, one of the world's largest management software suppliers for accountancy, payroll and human resource management software, is planning to set up an office in Hong Kong this year as a gateway to expanding to mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China and Hong Kong together have 50 million small and medium-sized companies, which is more than 50 per cent of the world's total. They are the target clients of Sage,” said Kerry Agiasotis, executive vice-president of Sage Asia during a recent visit to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company was set up almost 40 years ago in the UK by David Goldman, who developed software for companies to replace manual printed spreadsheets and enhance efficiency in handling their accounts. By expanding through a combination of partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, the company now has three million customers worldwide, in 23 countries. Clients who pay a monthly fee can access its sophisticated software via cloud technology.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Agiasotis said the company would like to adopt the same strategy to expand in Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We always keep an eye on good merger and acquisition opportunities, while we also want to expand through partners such as banks or other platforms that have access to SMEs,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is an ideal place as a hub as it has a lot of international companies setting up their offices here. It is also close to China, which is opening up to international investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said SMEs worldwide now employ 70 per cent of the working population globally so it is vital these companies have the right software to handle their accounts, payroll and other human resources functions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Previously, only the very big companies had the ability to develop these types of software. Nowadays, our cloud-bases services allow any SME of any size, from anywhere in the world, to also access the software they need,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">London's multiple-market structure enables companies ranging from innovative start-ups to mature, established firms to raise funds, according to London Stock Exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined to comment on whether listing reforms in Hong Kong - which might include introducing additional boards with different listing requirements - could help attract more e-commerce and technology companies to list their shares there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he did say that in his experience it was advantageous to offer several different markets catering for a broader range of prospective companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I can only share our experience that shows it would be better to have different markets to meet the different needs of companies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> agrees with the Hong Kong stock exchange principle of "one share, one vote", which prevents companies with a dual-class structure from floating their shares, because it is fair to investors, said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he said he understands why some e-commerce founders might be against it because they want to maintain control of their company despite holding a minority stake. In a dual-share listing, the stocks carry unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> allows firms with this dual-share structure to list on its High Growth Market, which is in between the AIM, the standard market and premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The four markets have different [listing] requirements and can meet the needs of different types of companies," said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is currently consulting the market on listing reforms which propose to set up two separate committees - a listing policy committee to set policies and a listing regulatory committee to approve complicated listing applications. The latest consultation period ends this Friday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Calls for reform came after e-commerce giant Alibaba chose New York over Hong Kong for its US$25 billion IPO two years ago because the former allows dual-share listings. The structure has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s because it is seen as breaching the long-held "one share, one vote" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators refused Alibaba's request for exemption from the rule, which would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate a majority of the board. Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma earlier this month criticised the Hong Kong listing rule, saying it is outdated and cannot match the needs of a modern economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rolet said the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is aware of many start-ups and private companies that want to raise funds but are not yet qualified to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has thus set up a programme called ELITE which allows such companies to undergo 18 months of support and mentorship to prepare them for a listing. Senior executives participate in a number of workshops aimed at helping them review and change their business model.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When they are ready, the companies can try to raise funds through investors or apply to list on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have had 450 companies in 27 countries in Europe, America and Africa [on the programme]," said Rolet. "We are considering bringing it to Asia where there are many high growth companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our youngest participant company in the ELITE programme is just seven months old, and the oldest one is a 700-year old wine making company. Some are start-ups while some of them are family-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no guarantee that these companies will succeed and some of them may collapse. But on average, these companies go on to have an annual growth rate of 60 per cent."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange could become a hub for mainland Chinese biotechnology firms thanks to a sweeping reform of listing rules, said the boss of </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, the first such company to take advantage of the new regime for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese cancer treatment firm, already listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, is aiming to raise about US$1 billion through a secondary flotation on the city's bourse on August 8. The public subscription period for the shares will run from Monday to Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are a lot of global investors who know biotechnology but who know very little about China. In Hong Kong, there are a lot of investors who know about China but know too little about biotechnology. We hope our listing in Hong Kong can help educate both of these types of investor,” said John Oyler, founder and chief executive of BeiGene at a media briefing on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has the potential to attract many more biotechnology firms to list here as well as the investors to trade here. The research analysts and other related parties will follow. This will create an ecosystem for the biotechnology industry in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Set up in 2010, the Beijing and US-based company focuses on “immuno-oncology” research, treatments that use the body's own immune system to fight cancer. It will issue 65 million new ordinary shares priced between HK$94.4 to HK$111.6 each, allowing the company to potentially raise between US$908 million and US$1.07 billion. It will be listed on the HKEX main board as a secondary listing, after it had already floated its stock on the US' tech-heavy Nas daq in 2016. It closed 3.81 per cent lower on Friday at US$166.52.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is definitely a very important market as our company starts to commercialise our products. A listing in Hong Kong will expand our investor base and brand awareness in Asia,” said Howard Liang, chief financial officer and chief strategy officer of </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in April carried out its biggest listing reform in 25 years to attract giant technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures - shares that carry different voting rights - and biotechnology firms that are yet to generate revenue to list. So far, eight biotech firms have submitted applications.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology, China's largest health care and online medical platform, has been accepted by the Hong Kong stock exchange for an initial public offering (IPO), despite making hefty losses for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's revenue soared 240.4 per cent from a year earlier, to 1.02 billion yuan (US$129.5 billion) in the nine months ended 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it still lost 497.4 million yuan for the nine months ended 2017, after a net loss of 614.2 million yuan in the first nine months of 2016, according to the application proof prospectus published on the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen-based financial conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) will spin off the health care portal, known as the “Good Doctor”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are [still] in the early stages of development with a limited operating history in an emerging and dynamic industry, and our historical results and financial performance are not indicative of future performance,” Ping An Healthcare said in the application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said one of the main risk factors included the possibility of being unable to recoup the investments it has made.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It added there may well be a need to constantly upgrade infrastructure to provide increased scale and keep pace with its business development targets. But there was a chance the capital expenditure will not be recovered in part or in full.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additionally some uncertainties remain under PRC law as to the IPO, as some past cooperations with offline medical institutions have been be deemed as providing diagnostics and treatment practices without licenses, thus creating legal risk, the company said.We are [still] in the early stages of development with a limited operating history in an emerging and dynamic industry, and our historical results and financial performance are not indicative of future performancePing An Healthcare, in its IPO application</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The potential IPO has already attracted major shareholders including Softbank Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund (7.41 per cent), and Vision Fund Singapore SPV (7.41 per cent), although no pricing details or time schedules have been set.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The joint sponsors are Citigroup Global Markets Asia and JP Morgan Securities (Far East).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proceeds will be used for business expansion, potential acquisitions and development of AI Assistant and other technologies, the application said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched in April 2015, Ping An Healthcare offers online medical services and has 192.8 million registered users, with network coverage including 3,100 hospitals and 7,500 pharmacy outlets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was China's largest internet health care platform in terms of average monthly active users and daily average online consultations in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan predicts China's internet health care market to grow to 197.8 billion yuan by 2026 from 10.9 billion in 2016, and online consultations to increase to 148.4 million in 2016 from 29.8 million in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange is expected to push ahead with IPO reforms to allow weighted voting rights for technology firms from June in a bid to attract more new economy companies to list and keep its status as a global financial services leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The controversial dual-class shares are favoured by founders and certain shareholders to retain more voting rights than other shareholders while critics have argued such a structure may lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently Ping An Healthcare's issued share capital is split into A-shares (77.2 per cent) and class B-shares (22.8 per cent). But it will have only one class of ordinary shares upon completion of the share redesignation, the application said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty, China's first internet-only insurer, raised US$1.5 billion in a Hong Kong IPO, and given a valuation of US$13 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts had said the city's first major fintech flotation suggested other technology-related firms were also able to list in Hong Kong successfully with one class of shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, the offshore arm of China's biggest brokerage, is planning to accelerate its expansion in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other areas that are part of the Beijing's ambitious “Belt and Road Initiative”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong-based brokerage, founded in 1986 and acquired by state-owned </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> five years ago, has re-entered Pakistan through a partnership with Alfalah Securities. It also intends to establish a presence in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Dubai this year through similar partnerships with local firms in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past 32 years, CLSA has established a presence in 13 markets in Asia, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Korea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As China expands, we are also expanding globally,” said Jonathan Slone, CEO of CLSA, in an interview in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asia is our backyard. [But] we want to be in all areas of the ‘Belt and Road Initiative'.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China launched its flagship global trade strategy five years ago, aiming to create an economic land belt that includes countries on the ancient Silk Road through central and west Asia, the Middle East and Europe, as well as a maritime route that links China's port facilities with the African coast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is estimated that Beijing has pumped several hundred billions of US dollars into building infrastructure projects across more than 70 countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, Chinese companies, mostly state-owned, have secured US$500 billion of construction contracts along the belt and road's route in the past five years. Funding for the projects mostly comes from state lenders or financial groups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone said because of the firm's relationship with </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">, which is controlled by China's </span><span class="s3">Citic Group</span><span class="s1">, CLSA has advantages in facilitating cross-border funding and carrying out capital market work for Chinese companies to expand overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being owned by a strong parent has put us in a unique position, into and out of China,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone hopes to leverage the parent's deep connections in China and CLSA's own extensive Asia network and global distribution, to play a more central role in helping Chinese companies go global and bringing international capital to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said CLSA's investment banking business has grown sharply, with the help of </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">. The firm has completed 17 initial public offerings so far this year and has an “enviable pipeline”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to the connections of its parent in China, CLSA has won work on a number of high-profile Chinese tech and internet IPOs in the Hong Kong market. It recently advised Xiaomi, the first company with a dual-class share structure to list in Hong Kong, and Beigene, the first Nasdaq-listed firm to seek a dual listing under Hong Kong's new rules to attract biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone also expects the firm's private equity business to expand, as he sees increasing demand from technology companies to raise capital from the private market. The firm currently has US$4 billion of assets under management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA kicks off its 25th investor forum on Monday in Hong Kong, an annual gathering of international investors, companies, and industry leaders to discuss political and economic conditions as well as future trends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone said for the first time, nearly half of the companies attending the forum this year are Chinese firms, which may be coming to tap public and private capital or new markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission is looking at ways to improve the conduct of banks' securities departments, with a report due to be issued in the next two to three weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Ashley Alder said the report was not part of the SFC's regulatory or supervisory functions but the result of working with large banks that operated securities business to find ways to improve their operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is aimed at finding the best practices and ways forward," Alder told more than 100 brokers and fund managers at a lunch yesterday. "It is aimed at achieving a better dialogue with industry so as to find ways to improve."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks are regulated by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> but those that also operate securities businesses need to follow the SFC's code of conduct to ensure sufficient risk-management and investor-protection measures are in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder also said the SFC was open minded about indications from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> that it intended to consult the market about dual-class share structures to meet the needs of some companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It would be entirely up to the exchange to have a public discussion about the issue," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such share structures have been the subject of heated debate since October, when the SFC refused to provide a waiver to mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, which sought to use a structure that would have allowed its 28 partners - mainly founders and senior executives - to name a majority of directors. The SFC said it would violate the one-share, one-vote principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder said the SFC would soon issue a consultation paper on the regulation of electronic trading systems known as dark pools and might also issue another on relaxing the requirements imposed on real estate investment trusts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will also look next year into regulations governing the way asset management companies pay their distributors. Britain has banned some commission payments to distributors while other markets require higher levels of transparency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder also welcomed an announcement last week that the HKEx and </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> had signed an agreement to co-operate on the introduction of yuan products and to work together on regulatory issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said some US and European regulation now would extend to Asia and it would be good to have the two exchanges form an alliance that could speak on behalf of Asia.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> may postpone its potential HK$100 billion listing plan to 2015 if the mainland's top e-commerce firm cannot get a deal done in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A delay would be linked to the terms of a deal struck last year with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, giving Alibaba the right to buy back half the 24 per cent stake the United States internet company holds in the mainland firm by the end of 2015, investment bankers told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Failure to list before December 31, 2015, would force Alibaba back to the negotiating table to agree new terms, bankers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun and his long-time friend and executive vice-chairman, Joe Tsai, have persuaded the company's top management that an initial public offering should not be rushed, despite a determined push in recent weeks to set the listing wheels in motion, sources familiar with the discussions told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's not about money. In fact, Alibaba isn't short of cash. Jack Ma cares more about retaining control of the company than how much money he can raise from the IPO," a banker with knowledge of the situation said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsai, who is considered Ma's closest adviser, told several bankers recently that a listing this year was not a must for Alibaba and that the company had other priorities including making overseas acquisitions, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and might have only a matter of weeks left before the same happened in Hong Kong, the Post reported on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Delaying to next year could put a big dent into the potential HK$100 billion analysts estimate Alibaba could raise if the deal comes to market this year, given the pent-up demand among fund managers after a lack of major new offerings this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba joins the swelling pipeline of deals for early next year, it risks coming to market as an expected increase in global interest rates fuelled by an anticipated scaling back of the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme jolts stock market valuations, money managers say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for Alibaba yesterday reiterated that the company had no specific timetable for an initial public offering, had not appointed underwriters, and had not selected a listing venue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has run into regulatory trouble in Hong Kong over Ma's determination to keep management control of the firm he founded in Hangzhou in 1999, despite having only a 7.4 per cent stake. The top management team combined own about 10 per cent of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beside's </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">'s 24 per cent holding, Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> has a 36.7 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Talks with Hong Kong regulators have been stalled by a stand-off over the firm's desire to retain a partnership structure that the authorities fear could give too much voting power to company executives at the expense of ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival Nasdaq are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed and in particular popular among technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You can't fault chief executive candidate Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee for ignoring the symptoms, misdiagnosing the malady and shying away from the treatment for what plagues Hong Kong's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a former government official and current Legislative Council representative, she offers the unique and frank insight of both an insider and outsider.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It increasingly appears that the mission of Hong Kong's future chief executive is to manage the expectations of a diminishing economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Or perhaps the architects of Hong Kong's government and bureaucracy are themselves the problem, not the solution to the economic conundrum, that nothing about Hong Kong should change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The source of Hong Kong's economic problems is the sense of complacency that hamstrings the city's ability to find a new role for itself, while China engages the world on its own terms, Ip said in a conversation in her Wanchai campaign office.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She confirmed what I have thought about Hong Kong government officials - that they are more interested in promoting worn out advertising themes than solving the city's real problems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Officials boast about Hong Kong's economic freedom or its laissez faire economy. But, to thrive in the real world economy you need to do more than achieve economic freedom,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong needs from its chief executive candidates more realistic and aggressive assessments of the economy to deal with its entrenched problems. Ill conceived, opportunistic thinking has dominated each of the city's administrations since 1997.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/10/1bc02f2a-eeb2-11e6-8960-2c6b8565de23_image_hires.JPG]She emphasized a stronger economic role for the government and the active development of a broad industrial and service economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her goal to identify where Hong Kong's competitive and comparative advantages lie, and how that fits into regional, national and global frameworks, sounds like the exercise bureaucrats should have done long ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ip is especially critical of the Hong Kong government's lack of strategic planning over the years. “Our government and successive administrations have failed to advance a convincing, forward looking narrative on where Hong Kong stands in the world and China,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her vision of an industrial policy doesn't mean jettisoning pillar industries and important employers in Hong Kong, such as financial services, trade, logistics, tourism, retail and professional services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She pointed out that traditional services need to improve through innovation, but offers no solutions to achieve higher standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial regulators and executives have been too slow and stubborn to adopt to fintech, Ip said. She cited how China is far ahead of Hong Kong in electronic payments and how our economic development is hurt by resistance to change and a lack of vision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She fell short of suggesting how to get the right kind of people in place to reverse the slide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Hong Kong's financial development is complicated by China's own growing markets. Many bankers and asset managers complain to her that the Hong Kong's government is not doing enough to promote market development. However, she pointed out that the development of the yuan settlement market is not monopolised or dominated by Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/02/10/47006b14-eeb2-11e6-8960-2c6b8565de23_image_hires.JPG]What did she think of the proposal from my earlier column about how the Hong Kong government could invest HK$1 billion over a thousand startup companies to seed the industry?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She quickly dismissed any idea where the government assumes a direct role in venture capital, where it invests in startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Civil servants don't want direct interface with entrepreneurs, she said. They prefer to match funding, alongside private sector investors. Bureaucrats fear financial losses and the investigations that usually follow; they don't like assuming that level of risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, she offered the flawed alternative of having a third board on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to accommodate technology companies that demand dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lowering listing standards to overcome what she characterises as “rigid and conservative stock market development” is a path to weak corporate governance and abuse of minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rejection and scepticism of technology by entire sectors is a common affliction here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's tourism industry still sustains small travel agencies who book hotels and tours. Their business models have been made obsolete by internet travel sites, so they desperately need to find a way to add value to what they offer travellers. Instead, the local tourism industry wants to reinstate individual tours by mainland China tourists, she said. That's not a sustainable, long term solution or policy, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's expensive real estate appears to have no resolution other than the status quo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Land policy reforms have been discussed for years. But the bureaucrats and civil servants do not have the guts to do it. I don't think a civil servant or bureaucrat-turned-leader will dare do it,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is cause for optimism though. “I don't think we need a revolutionary approach to land policy,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Could Hong Kong follow Singapore's land policies?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore started from “a historically clean slate that makes it fundamentally different from Hong Kong,” she said. “But there are still policies we can execute to improve living standards.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is set to reap a bumper budget surplus this year as experts warn of a structural surplus problem, with HK$120 billion already in the bag and the final figure likely to be just shy of HK$160 billion by the end of March, according to figures obtained by thePost.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The massive projected surplus, at least seven times the original estimate of HK$16.3 billion for 2017-18, has reignited criticism of officials' conservative calculations, and the resultant failure to invest in things like public hospitals and helping the elderly and the young.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Experts chastised officials for taking what they called a doom-and-gloom outlook and forecasting a fiscal structural deficit by 2021. One economist said the problem was the exact opposite, with the city facing a structural surplus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With such resources at his disposal, pressure is piling on Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po to give one-off relief measures when he delivers his annual budget on February 28.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While big accounting firms had predicted that the surplus - that is, a positive difference between the government's income and its outgoings - this year might be between HK$160 billion and HK$180 billion by the end of March 2018, a source familiar with the fiscal position predicted a final figure just below that range.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year's projection would smash a record set in the last financial year, when the city reeled in a surplus of HK$92.8 billion, eight times the original estimate of HK$11.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of November last year, the city had a cumulative surplus for the year of HK$57.2 billion, four times the original estimate of HK$16.3 billion for the whole of 2017-18.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's fiscal reserves exceeded HK$1.7 trillion by December 31 last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these surpluses all wash in against a backdrop of looming deficit, which will almost certainly come about as a result of the city's ageing population. As the share of the population aged over 65 - and therefore not working and paying income tax - grows, the government's revenue is likely to shrink. At the same time, the cost of caring for this growing elderly population will hit the public coffers, making surpluses a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two veteran economists invited by thePostto revisit the projections made by the government's long-term fiscal planning panel four years ago said the government's supercharged income could delay that structural deficit for 15 years or even stop it ever becoming a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both said the government's study failed to work in the “China factor”, which has fuelled huge rises on the Hong Kong stock market and record-high land prices in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has been experiencing the biggest structural economic growth and it is because of China,” said Franklin Lam Fan-keung, founder of think tank HKGolden50 and a former investment bank analyst who served the government's Central Policy Unit during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But we did not feed the growth, we did not pour money into social and economic infrastructure ... Offices, hotels and hospitals ended up being very expensive in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Official statistics show the average annual growth rate of the government's revenue from 2009-10 to 2014-15 was estimated at 6.2 per cent in government budgets. Looking back, the actual growth rate was 8.5 per cent, while the corresponding figure for expenditure was 6.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/12/321dc128-0f3c-11e8-a09e-8861893b1b1a_image_hires_103506.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Lam pointed out that if the revenue growth calculation took into account one-off relief measures and various funds set aside by John Tsang Chun-wah - financial secretary for the whole period - the rate would be as high as 9.9 per cent, 3.7 percentage points higher than the original estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From 2010-11, in response to unexpectedly high revenue from land premiums and stamp duty, Tsang squirrelled away lump sums ranging from HK$26 billion to HK$77 billion each year to bankroll sweeteners or designated funds to address specific public concerns, like drug abuse or housing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In so doing, he effectively reduced the size of some annual surpluses by almost half and, in some extreme cases, by two-thirds. Including those lump sums, the government's budget surpluses from 2010-11 to 2016-17 would almost double to at least HK$814.8 billion, from the current recorded total of HK$433.5 billion, in stark contrast with the HK$27.7 billion forecast in the government's study.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Yet, with so much money [to hand], the government didn't build a new hospital or build a land bank, and elderly people's savings have been eroded by inflation,” Lam said. He said Tsang had taken an overly frugal fiscal approach and failed to invest in opportunities to grow the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said the government's long-term fiscal study projected future revenue from a starting point in 2014-15 when revenue was estimated at 19.4 per cent of GDP. But in reality, including chunks of surplus set aside deliberately, that figure was more like 24 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on bigger annual revenue growth, Lam's think tank projected that the structural deficit would only emerge in 2036, even if government spending increases 3 per cent every year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese University associate professor of economics Terence Chong Tai-leung said the task force should not have predicted government revenue growth based on GDP growth, as the former is set to exceed the latter, thanks to a stamp duty windfall. The annualised growth rate of stamp duty in the past 27 years - from 1989 to 2017 - was 9.4 per cent, while annualised government revenue growth stood at 7.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chong noted a recent structural change in stamp duty. He said he expected its growth to continue to expand in coming years, making the duty - paid on property and stock purchases - the biggest source of government income and further driving up its total revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The problem of structural deficit would already be resolved if the additional income from stamp duties would cover the extra expenditure triggered by the ageing issues,” he said, adding that 9.4 per cent growth in stamp duty was a very conservative estimate as policies such as the stock connect and the introduction of dual-class technology stock listings would further fuel its growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's windfall from stamp duty is derived almost evenly from its robust property and stock markets. Special Stamp Duty and Buyers' Stamp Duty were introduced in 2010 and 2012 respectively in a bid to curb the overheated property market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched in 2014, the mainland-Hong Kong stock connect lets international and mainland Chinese investors trade securities on each other's markets through the trading and clearing facilities of their home exchange. It has also contributed a hefty sum in stamp duty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said the daily turnover of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba - which owns theSouth China Morning Post- last year would account for more than a third of daily turnover on the Hong Kong stock market if it had been allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Had Alibaba been allowed to list in Hong Kong, the amount of stamp duty collected by the government could have been used to waive taxpayers' salary tax,” he said. “According to our calculations, 90 per cent of Hong Kong taxpayers could enjoy a tax holiday; those earning less than HK$65,000 a month can be exempted from paying salary tax.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The same amount of money that the government would forfeit under such a holiday could boost recurrent spending on the overloaded local health care system by 60 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More potential could be realised if other hi-tech mainland companies like phone maker Xiaomi listed in Hong Kong, Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Professor Liu Pak-wai, a leading economist involved in the government's long-term fiscal planning, defended the study.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The study did forecast surpluses in the early years of the long-term projection, although the size of the surpluses in the past few years are unexpectedly massive,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said it was difficult to make a reliable forecast of land revenues, and that the property cooling measures also boosted stamp duty income.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Government spending was also smaller than expected because of filibustering and judicial reviews,” he said, referring to delays - in the legislature and the courts - to major construction projects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Having said that, the study could have made some policy recommendations on how these fiscal challenges can be coped with. But we were not empowered to do so,” he said, adding that the fiscal study should be reviewed every five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A government spokesman said while the administration had noted the recommendations in the working group report, “they have not been and will not be constraints on government spending, which is determined with reference to the needs of Hong Kong for economic and social developments as well as our fiscal strength.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is poised to lose its crown as the world's top market for initial public offerings this year after seeing the value of deals plummet 77 per cent in the third quarter in the absence of ­blockbuster listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the period, US$2.69 billion was raised from 32 deals on both the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> showed, a sharp fall from the US$11.74 billion seen a year earlier, when </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> raised US$7.3 billion in the world's largest flotation since 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first nine months of this year, there were a total of 98 listings on the two boards to raise US$9.14 billion, down 52.2 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board saw 50 deals worth US$8.65 billion to take a 7.2 per cent global share, ranking it third among the world's top stock exchanges by the amount of proceeds raised. It had topped the global rankings for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> took the top spot with US$20.4 billion from 48 deals, giving it a 16.9 per cent global share. The amount of proceeds jumped 170.9 per cent from a year earlier after Snap chose to launch its US$3.9 billion flotation there in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/09/25/52c7f642-a109-11e7-9b91-f74e36ea6345_image_hires_000829.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also lost out to the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which raised just under US$14 billion in 160 deals to take an 11.6 per cent global share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With only three months to go until the end of the year and no news of any big players planning to list in Hong Kong, the exchange is unlikely to return to the top," said Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It has lost out to other markets such as New York as we have not done enough to attract new-economy companies to list here. We should change our listing regime quickly."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> completed a consultation to set up a new board to allow listings by companies with a dual-class share structure and start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Charles Li ­Xiaojia said the consensus pointed towards carrying out reform to capture new-economy firms but a second consultation had been planned later this year before the new board could be launched.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial sector account­ed for the biggest share of listing proceeds raised in the city in the first nine months of this year, at 60 per cent, followed by health-care firms with 10 per cent and the consumer sector with 9.4 per cent. Hi-tech firms accounted for just 5.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest listing in Hong Kong so far this year was the US$2.2 billion deal by </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> in March, followed by mainland online insurance broker Zhong An Online P&amp;C ­Insurance, which just raised US$1.5 billion last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's global ranking for technology listings was a lowly 13, way behind New York, Shenzhen and Singapore.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a disappointing year for Hong Kong as a global fundraising hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city lost the IPO crown to New York after two straight years in the spot and slipped behind Shanghai for the first time. Hong Kong's IPO value for 2017 dropped to the lowest level since 2012 to US$16.3 billion, compared with US$49.5 billion in the US and US$31.7 billion in China, according to data from Dealogic as of December 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Edward Au, co-leader of the national public offering group at Deloitte China, is positive about 2018. He expects Hong Kong's IPO value to jump by 25 per cent to 48 per cent to between HK$160 billion to HK$190 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rebound will be fuelled by two catalysts - Hong Kong exchange's IPO rule changes to allow dual-class shares and China lifting the ban on share sales of owners of state-owned enterprises, or so-called “full circulation of H shares”, Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coming back to 2017, 18 tech IPOs raised US$3.3 billion in Hong Kong, accounting for 20.2 per cent of the pool, the second biggest source of floats, according to Dealogic. The fundraising also more than tripled compared with the average US$933 million from 2013 to 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/27/d3dc8f42-e70c-11e7-8ff5-d91dc767c75e_image_hires_210116.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Finance IPOs still took the lion's share at 36 per cent, but it was markedly lower from 69 per cent in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurance came in at No 3, replacing property from last year's rankings, thanks largely to ZhongAn Online Property and Casualty Insurance's US$1.5 billion float in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A similar trend was seen in the US. Tech replaced finance as the biggest source of IPOs, with its share rising to 24.4 per cent from 16.6 per cent in 2016. The value of tech IPOs also increased three fold to US$12.3 billion from last year's US$4.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia ex-Japan, technology listings also ranked No 1 by sector, making up 16.7 per cent of the region's IPOs in 2017 by value, compared with 8.5 per cent in 2016. Finance slipped to No 3 from last year's No 1, with a share of 11.6 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong investors gave a warm welcome to the flurry of tech IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the nine tech and internet IPOs on the main board, the average public oversubscription rate was 367 times.That was in stark contrast with the average 2.2 times for the eight finance IPOs on the main board, among which were two big listings - </span><span class="s3">Zhongyuan Bank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Guangzhou Rural Commercial Bank</span><span class="s1"> - that did not even garner enough subscription and had to price their offer lower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tech stocks jumped by an average 56 per cent from the IPO price on the first day of trading, while financial shares only rose 5 per cent on average on debut.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Technology stocks usually have higher beta and are more volatile in nature compared with stocks of real asset-backed businesses,” said Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Financial Group. “People trade mainly on expectations.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/27/d4371c78-e70c-11e7-8ff5-d91dc767c75e_image_hires_210116.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trend was seen in shares of the year's four biggest tech IPOs - ZhongAn Online, China Literature, </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, and Razer - which quickly soared to peaks within the first few trading sessions after debut before embarking on a downward trajectory. The shares have since dropped more than 20 per cent from their highs. Yixin and Razer even breached their IPO levels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That shift in sentiment has led to a cooling-off in the market in the past month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These shares surged initially amid enthusiasm, but then when the frenzy receded, the stock price pulled back and the trading turned more quiet,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong investors arelearning from their experiences in new economy listings.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the companies and investment banks may also have priced the IPOs too high when the market was feverish, which made the shares more vulnerable to a pull back after listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is on track to beat </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> to return as the top initial public offering (IPO) market this year, for the first time since 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first 11 months of the year, Hong Kong had a 15.7 per cent market share of IPO funds worldwide, with 70 companies listing in the city raising a total of US$31.2 billion. That is already more than the full-year figure of US$29.7 billion raised last year, according to Dealogic data released exclusively to the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's performance this year puts it far ahead of second-place New York, which has a 9.8 per cent market share with US$19.57 billion raised by 52 companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was beaten by New York last year after it lost the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s record US$25 billion listing. With the e-commerce giant's listing, the New York market saw US$74.18 billion of fundraising by 118 companies, compared with Hong Kong's US$29.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After Hong Kong and New York, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> is running third with US$17.46 billion and Shanghai fourth with US$17.11 billion. Shenzhen's ChiNext, which has raised US$4.83 billion so far, is 14th.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The strong stock market rally in the first half of this year allowed several large brokerage houses on the mainland to conduct IPO in Hong Kong. New York beat Hong Kong last year mainly due to the Alibaba deal. The tables have been turned this year," said Joseph Tong Tang, executive director of </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said he expects Hong Kong to remain on top of the IPO league table as many mainland firms will still need to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many mainland companies are in favour of listing in Hong Kong as the market has more international investors. In addition, the mainland IPO market is suspended from time to time. prompting mainland firms to opt for Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike Hong Kong or Western markets, where companies decide when to go public, the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> controls the pace of listing and has suspended IPO eight times in the past two decades to tackle bear markets or in response to market malpractices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland market was most recently suspended between July and early November in the wake of the stock rout that saw market capitalisation in Shanghai and Shenzhen slashed by nearly a third from the mid-June peak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland IPO market had also been frozen for more than a year from late 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Suspensions like these have worked well for Hong Kong, making it the top IPO market for three years in a row from 2009 to 2011. The 2008 financial crisis that severely dented Western markets and forced some companies - like Italian luxury fashion brand Prada - to list here also worked in Hong Kong's favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the good numbers, the quality of some of the new listings has been a cause of regulatory concern, however. </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing last month said the commission would review the listing regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong's statement came after wild swings in some of the new stocks on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) and dubious backdoor listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is mostly financial firms that raise money in Hong Kong, with the city failing to attract technology companies to list here. Alibaba opted for New York after Hong Kong regulators refused to allow it dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC review is likely to tighten up the listing process. This may cut down the number of new listings in Hong Kong. However, it would benefit the industry in the long run as it could allow the Hong Kong IPO market to develop in a more healthy way," Joseph Tong said. "The SFC review could also seek ways of attracting more technology firms and start-ups to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage, said he believes IPOs may slow down next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many IPOs have not done very well as the market sentiment is weak. Stock market outlook in Hong Kong and the mainland has been affected by the slowdown of the mainland economy," Tse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Bank of Qingdao</span><span class="s1">, which debuted in Hong Kong on Thursday, was trading slightly down, after pricing the stock at the bottom of its indicative price range.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong must reform its listing rules to attract New Economy businesses and remain relevant as Asia's financial hub, said </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">' founder Jack Ma. The city as a destination for the initial public offer of Alibaba's online payments unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is “not a foregone conclusion,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, also called AliPay, is poised for an IPO to fund its expansion. At issue is whether Hong Kong's regulatory framework is suitable for companies engaged in financial technology, or fintech, said Ma.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There's been a lot of media reports and speculation as to whether AliPay will list in Hong Kong,” Ma said in a telephone interview with the South China Morning Post. “We will list in Hong Kong only if we think the city is ready.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“All the existing listing regulations were designed decades ago before the Internet Age for property developers, banks, financiers and traditional retailers, and not relevant to startups and new businesses,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 343 companies that raised capital in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013, only 22, or 6 per cent of the total, were technology related, according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chose to list its shares in New York in 2014, in a US$25 billion IPO that was the world's largest that year. The Hangzhou-based company operates the world's largest online shopping and e-commerce platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A factor that swayed Alibaba's choice was the Hong Kong regulator's refusal to allow for a dual-share structure, on the grounds that it violates the long-held principle of “one share, one vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such structures are prevalent among many technology startups including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba, where many company founders hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 US-listed Chinese companies such as Baidu and Weibo, 29 of them have dual-class structures. Baidu's founder Robin Li owns only 15.9 per cent of the company but has a voting right of 53.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The global economic structure has changed, and our existing listing regime must change with it,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a broker and the Hong Kong lawmaker representing the city's financial services. “If nothing is changed, all these technology and New Economy companies will list in the US or other overseas markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The competition has taken on added urgency. The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) won approval from its listing advisory committee in September to allow companies to list dual-share structures. It may be a necessary measure for Singapore's bourse, which has attracted few IPOs in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US market has shown that such structures can attract big technology startups to list. The top 25 dual-share structure companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">LinkedIn</span><span class="s1"> in the US have a combined market capitalisation of US$927.42 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, an AliPay IPO in Hong Kong doesn't need a waiver to the regulator's principle, since the company isn't incorporated under a dual-share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, an intensive debate and several rounds of public consultation have been underway in Hong Kong since the city missed out on the IPO of Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock sale would have added much-needed market turnover, giving brokers higher commission income from transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, US$1.61 billion of Alibaba's shares changed hands in New York, equivalent to a fifth of the market turnover on Hong Kong's main board on the same day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, the commercial unit of the stock exchange, also missed out on an initial listing fee of HK$650,000 and an annual listing fee of HK$1.9 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AliPay, through which shoppers on Alibaba's Taobao and TMall platforms can make payments, is valued at US$60 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What is lacking in Hong Kong is the spirit of innovation, which regrettably stands in the way of the city realising its goal of becoming Asia's financial centre,” Ma said. “I'm confident Hong Kong can still claim its place as the financial centre of the region if it carries forward with its reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in 2014 began consulting the market about various measures to change its listing rules and mechanism, including the possibility of permitting dual-share structures in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation has gone in fits and starts, with the deadline of the latest round that began in June extended until November 18.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s latest proposal to cement founder Jack Ma Yun's control of management after a possible listing in the city might be more acceptable to objectors than a dual shareholding structure. But it is not a perfect solution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior sources at the stock market regulators - the Securities and Futures Commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> - have told White Collar categorically that they would reject any application for a dual share structure to allow Ma and Alibaba's management to keep control of the company after a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a logical position. Allowing it would go against similar requests from </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> in the 1990s and the application last year from English football club Manchester United. Dual share structures, permitted in the US but not Hong Kong, give some shareholders more voting rights than the others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulatory sources said they would not consider a dual-shareholding structure because many investors did not like it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"One share, one vote", is what fund managers and investors say is fair and equal in Hong Kong, as do the regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources at Alibaba say that this line of argument is spurious because the firm is not asking for a dual class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What it wants is to be allowed a partnership structure in which senior management would have the power to nominate a simple majority of the board members and then have shareholders vote on those nominations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba, while Japan's </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> own more than 60 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources at Alibaba and bankers close to it portray this as merely a waiver under an existing provision of listing rule 8.11 which states: "The share capital of a new applicant must not include shares of which the proposed voting power does not bear a reasonable relationship to the equity interest of such shares when fully paid."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It lists two exceptions - one in exceptional circumstances agreed by the exchange, and another when listed companies already have dual shares listed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Alibaba argument goes that if the exemption to the rule wasn't intended to be used, it wouldn't have been created.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some might say that is a little like saying rules are there to be broken - or exempted if they don't suit you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Putting that point to one side, this supposed compromise would still have the net effect of reducing the number of candidates that could be nominated as board directors by the firm's major shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That worries regulators who fear their decision could be blamed in any future dispute between Alibaba management and shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They remain concerned about any proposal that may ultimately amount to giving one group of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators must consider this carefully.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The boom in Chinese technology IPOs in Hong Kong is likely to continue for at least another year following a record number so far this year, says Bao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The [IPO] window is open in Hong Kong, and will stay open,” Bao, whose investment bank has built a reputation as a key adviser on Chinese tech IPOs and M&amp;As, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the main reasons for the boom is the reform in Hong Kong's listing rules, which came into effect in April. The new rules allow companies with dual class shares to list and also makes it easier for pre-profit biotech firms to launch their IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another driver is the development stage of the Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few years, many of these firms have made great progress under the support of financing from private equity funds. They have matured and reached the IPO stage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They are ready now. ”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of last week, 13 Chinese tech and related companies had made their stock market debut in Hong Kong this year, raising a combined US$6.86 billion. The number and value were both the highest on record since 1995, according to data compiled by Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the same period, 15 Chinese tech and related IPOs were launched in the US market, matching the record set in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the star start-ups to list in Hong Kong this year include smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in July, and food delivery service app </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> , which raised US$4.2 billion last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pinduoduo, an online discounter, mopped up US$1.6 billion from its US listing in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Renaissance advised on both the Meituan and Pinduoduo deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even more big IPOs are in the pipeline, including ride-sharing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> , news aggregation app Jinri Toutiao, and video-sharing app Kuaishou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are still many more next year,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market sentiment, however, has changed significantly since earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index traded at 27,762 on Thursday morning, slightly lower than the previous close. The index recently entered a technical bear market, reaching a low of 26,613 earlier this month, down more than 20 per cent from a high of 33,484 on January 26.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The volatility, largely because of the US-China trade war, currency turmoils in emerging markets and fear of further interest rate hikes, have dampened interest for new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of those that have debuted recently have seen their share price drop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 10 biggest IPOs in the past 12 months - China Tower, Xiaomi, </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> , </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1"> , Ping An Good Doctor, China Literature, Haidilao, Jiangxi Bank, </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> , and </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> - are all trading below their offer prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Renaissance also fell heavily on the first day of trading on Thursday, down as much as 20 per cent to HK$25.60, compared to its offer price of HK$31.80.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Bao said he was not concerned about short-term price volatility for Chinese tech IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I don't think that's an issue. The volatility often occurs in the price discovery process, and in the end the market will reach a consensus about the valuation,” he said. “The key is whether the tech company has real innovation.”Volatility often occurs in the price discovery process, and in the end the market will reach a consensus about the valuationBao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides, he said, volatility is not necessarily a bad thing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The capital market always has cycles. It helps eliminate the inferior and lets the fittest ones survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bao said he is bullish on both China's new economy sector, which is driven by the new round of industrial and technological revolution, and relevant financial services, which still underserves the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As China's new economy grows and household wealth increases, the relevant financial services sector will also grow fast. I think the sector will double in size in five years,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Renaissance currently has three principal business lines - investment banking, investment management, and Huajing Securities, the onshore securities platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bao said investment management and wealth management will be the two main focus areas for the bank. Going forward, the firm plans to increase investments in emerging technologies, particularly AI, biotech, internet of things, and blockchain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank is currently raising funds for its second private equity fund focused on health care, which will be “significantly larger” than the first fund's 1.1 billion yuan (US$160 million). But he declined to reveal the exact size.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Health care has big potential, ” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also wants to expand its product portfolio from advisory services to credit products, such as leveraged loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other than that, it will continue to expand globally, including in the US, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US-China trade war does not affect our expansion plan,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, it employs a team of close to 30 in the US, offering investment banking and sales and trading services for institutional clients, a big part of which are Chinese investors who want to trade American depositary receipts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new global report on corporate governance performance has found more than half of Hong Kong's largest listed companies failed to meet some aspects of the government's voluntary standards, although the rate is an improvement on last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forty six per cent of the Hang Seng Composite Index (HKCI) constituent companies are now in full compliance with the “Corporate Governance Code” issued by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) in January 2005, according to Grant Thornton Hong Kong's 2017 Corporate Governance Review, which assesses compliance with voluntary codes in the city each year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That [Hong Kong] ratio has improved from last year, [when 41 per cent of HSCI companies were found to have met the requirements fully] so companies have enhanced their disclosure on information about code compliance, internal controls and risk management,” said Mian Wong, director for advisory at Grant Thornton Hong Kong, after it had reviewed 472 companies on the HSCI for this year's study.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he also expected the market to continue to enhance transparency of its disclosures on how they manage risks “to preserve investor confidence”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect regulators to pay more attention to listed companies' disclosures about corporate governance, and companies themselves can also enhance [their] internal regulations and see how companies prepare for leading changes in a turbulent environment and react to the disruptive changes in technology,” said Wong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The annual study is global, and Hong Kong's performance remains poor compared to other major financial centres such as the UK (mainland London), where the study said 66 per cent of FTSE 350 companies declared full compliance - a record and increase of 4 percentage points from last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Big-cap Chinese companies, such as some insurers, have become more cautious [about the issue] and have strengthened internal controls to strengthen their brands,” added Eugene Ha, deputy managing partner for Grant Thornton Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He urged more of Hong Kong's smaller companies, however, to follow suit and improve their internal regulation, with particular attention paid to risk management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ha also touched on the highly-anticipated introduction soon of dual-class shares, calling it “an inevitable trend”, adding the most-important aspect to get right will be ensuring the quality of listed companies, when the detailed rules are unveiled, expected by the market within the next few months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The review also noted the increasing significance of cybersecurity to Hong Kong companies, with 18 per cent of those firms polled mentioning IT security is now higher up their business agendas than in the past, with related roles considered integral to management teams</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That figures was eight per cent in past year's study.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report added too that 30 per cent of the 50 components of the benchmark Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong's ‘bluechips') now employed a chief technology offices, chief information officer, or chief security officer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, one of Hong Kong's largest travel agencies, </span><span class="s3">WWPKG Holdings</span><span class="s1">, revealed its customer database had been hacked leaving customer's personal information at risk, raising concerns about overall levels of cybersecurity in Hong Kong, one of the world's biggest global financial centre.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two of the world's top business consulting groups, McKinsey's and EY, have urged </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) to be ultra-careful and selective in choosing which firms will be allowed to list on its proposed New Board, or what some are calling “The Third Board”, stock market which will target new-economy, start-up companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Board will be operated separately from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">McKinsey's managing partner of Greater China Joe Ngai said HKEX should only let in start-ups that have solid business models and high prospects of profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a good idea for HKEX to propose the launch of a new market for start-up companies as many will not be able to match the requirement of the main board or the GEM to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But early-stage start-ups should not be allowed to list. If they only have a concept or an idea and no solid business performance or income, they would present too risky a prospect for investors,” he said, speaking at last week's </span><span class="s3">World Economic Forum</span><span class="s1"> in Dalian last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the exchange simply allowed these start-ups to list, it may end up with a market full of poor quality companies, and that would be a repeat of what mistakes were make when the GEM was created.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999, positioning itself then as the Hong Kong version of the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in the US for hi-tech companies to list. But it has been widely considered as a flop in attracting quality tech firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In May 2017, average daily turnover for the GEM was still only HK$742 million (US$95 million), under 1 per cent of the main board's daily average for the same months and even lower than when it was launched with great fanfare in November 1999</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX launched a consultation paper a fortnight ago proposing the Third Board. It is planned to be split into two separate smaller markets: a premium one open to all investors for companies that can match the main board's high requirement, but which have a dual-class share structure which is banned on the main exchange, and another one for start-ups, in which only professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ngai believes the Third Board would attract more technology firms to list if retail investors were to trade on it too.The much better option for early-stage start-ups is venture capital or incubator funding. It would be better to let start-ups grow to a certain size and strength before allowing them to list on the proposed new marketJack Chan Hoi, managing partner of financial services for EY in Greater China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong retail investors are smart. Many of them are veterans who can make their own investment choices,” Ngai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adding his backing, too, for only carefully selected entry to the New Board, Jack Chan Hoi, EY's managing partner of financial services of Greater China area, said HKEX must be fearful of allowing start-ups to list too early.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX needs to be selective in the choice - they have to be solid businesses,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The much better option for early-stage start-ups is venture capital or incubator funding. It would be better to let start-ups grow to a certain size and strength before allowing them to list on the proposed new market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The quality and prospects of any company on the board must be impressive,” Chan said, adding he is aware of many mainland start-ups who might like to use the proposed new board to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is a liquid market used by many international investors. HKEX's proposed new board should attract both mainland start-ups and large technology firms to list in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A series of successful recent initial public offerings suggests Hong Kong's stock exchange may be turning into a listing hub for technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the transformation is something of a mixed blessing as two large international companies with a traditional business focus announce their departure from the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new trend shows the exchange's efforts to get more "new economy" companies to list their shares here is bearing fruit, while past attempts to attract and retain international companies have proved less successful.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange, traditionally a hub for financial and property companies, has seen several technology IPOs in recent weeks selling like hot cakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though Hong Kong is one of the largest IPO destinations in the world in terms of funds raised, it has until now not been popular with technology companies. It ranked only 12th worldwide for tech IPOs in the first eight months of this year, below the likes of New York, Switzerland, Singapore and South Korea, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, funds raised through tech IPOs in the same period surged threefold to US$18.87 billion from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO market has been dominated by financial firms, which made up 59 per cent of funds raised between January and September, while technology companies accounted for a mere 0.8 per cent, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent spate of tech IPOs hopefully represents a turnaround. The latest data from the stock exchange shows IT shares had become the third largest category in the Hong Kong stock market as of the end of September, after property and finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO trend is likely to continue, particularly after the regulator and the government supported </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in launching a pilot scheme next year to allow "unicorn" internet companies - those with a valuation exceeding US$1 billion - with dual class shares structure to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The red hot fintech IPO rally started with online-only insurer </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which launched the biggest listing by a financial technology firm in Hong Kong's history in September, locking in about HK$200 billion (US$25.64 billion) of capital in an offering that was nearly 400 times oversubscribed ahead of its debut, making it the most popular flotation of the year at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Literature listing expected to leave ZhongAn's IPO in its shadow[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2117813/china-literature-listing-expected-leave-zhongans-ipo-its-shadow]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its record however was quickly and easily surpassed by China Literature, the mainland's largest online publishing and e-book site, which has just completed its IPO this week and is expected to be oversubscribed by more than 600 times and lock up about HK$520 billion (US$66.66 billion). That would make it the second highest on record after </span><span class="s3">China Railway Construction Corporation</span><span class="s1">'s IPO locked up capital of HK$540 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US-based gaming equipment maker Razer, which is backed by </span><span class="s3">Intel Corp</span><span class="s1"> and Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, also started its IPO in Hong Kong on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a natural trend for investors to shift their focus to the technology and new economies as mainland companies such as Tencent or Alibaba are not just coming out with good innovations, but also delivering profits," said Clement Chan Kam-wing, managing director of accounting firm BDO.Hong Kong investors are very smart. They put their money on whatever sector or companies promise them a good returnClement Chan Kam-wing, managing director, BDO</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong investors are very smart. They put their money on whatever sector or companies promise them a good return. The trend of fintech and other technology companies listing in Hong Kong is set to continue in the coming year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These technology IPOs are very popular with Hong Kong investors. Many investors want to take a quick profit after seeing the strong share-price rally of the technology companies in both Hong Kong and overseas," said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn's share price shot up at least 60 per cent from its debut at HK$59.7 on September 28 to HK$90.8 on October 9 before dropping back to HK$77.3 at Thursday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides retail investors wanting to make a quick profit from the tech IPO bonanza , large institutional investors are also chasing these stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The primary listings of technology-related companies in Hong Kong benefit from the level of local investor participation as well as international investor interest. Investors are seeking good liquidity and coverage by analysts," said Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of insurance company AIA Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the lock-up of so much capital in the tech IPOs and other technology-related stocks has dried up the liquidity in traditional stocks, prompting two international firms to opt for exit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week's sizzling IPO bonanza was counterbalanced somewhat by news of the delistings of the two companies, which had faced a cold response from local investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American luxury brand Coach announced on Wednesday that it would withdraw from its secondary listing in Hong Kong because of thin trading. That came a day after </span><span class="s3">Glencore</span><span class="s1">, the Swiss commodity trading and mining firm, said it would delist on January 31 next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Coach and </span><span class="s3">Glencore</span><span class="s1"> launched their secondary listings in the city in 2011, after the Hong Kong stock exchange ramped up its marketing campaign to promote the value of an expanded equity presence to multinational companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their departure suggests their listings had not helped HKEX to become more international. Hong Kong stock market is still very much dominated by mainland companies, which account for 38 per cent of the main board's market capitalisation and 47 per cent of its turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the top 10 most traded stocks in Hong Kong in the third quarter, eight were Chinese firms, with only </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> and HKEX itself as the exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX proposes latest ‘Connect' system - this time to lure more foreign listings and then link them with Chinese shareholders[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2112258/hkex-proposes-latest-connect-system-time-lure-more-foreign]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, chairman of Christfund Securities and a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the current tech fever may be just a short-term phenomenon. He believes investors would still be interested in buying the shares of good quality international companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's very important for HKEX to fight for the many infrastructure projects of the Belt and Road Initiative to list here. And it's likely that if HKEX could successfully fight for </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list here, it would be the world's largest IPO and would encourage investors to trade these international stocks listing in Hong Kong," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia is considering listing about 5 per cent of the state oil giant next year, which would raise US$100 billion if the firm was valued at about US$2 trillion as hoped.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Equity investors in mainland China will have to use either the nascent Connect programmes or the soon-to-be-launched Chinese depository receipts (CDRs) for gaining access to offshore stocks, because the country is not ready for companies with multiple classes of stocks to list, said the head of the Chinese pension fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are many manipulative activities in the Chinese market” so the scheme on the Hong Kong stock exchange that allows companies with multiple classes of stocks to raise capital can't work on the mainland, said Lou Jiwei, the former finance minister who now heads China's 2.5 trillion yuan (US$390 billion) retirement fund. “Hong Kong has launched it, but it's not time yet for China to do the same.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights, also known as multi-class stocks, are favoured by technology companies from Alibaba to </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> , as they enable founder-entrepreneurs to maintain control of their companies, even with minority stakes. They are so critical to attracting technology start-ups that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's securities regulator</span><span class="s1"> and stock market operator pushed through the biggest changes in the city's listing rules in three decades to accommodate them. That wouldn't be the case in China, Lou said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, Chinese investors will rely on depository receipts which will be issued by custodian banks in exchange for shares of offshore-listed tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> . Another avenue is the Connect programme, through which the exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen are linked with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese retirement scheme will maintain a “moderately overweight” weighting of Hong Kong's market and investment more in stocks in the scheme, Lou said. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng trades at 12.5 times earnings on average, cheaper than the 14.9 times on the Shanghai Composite Index, and the 28.3 times on the Shenzhen Composite.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As an international financial hub, Hong Kong has a valuable role to play to support mainland China's commitment to open and reform its economy, said the former People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan , at the same forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By launching the Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and the mutual fund recognition programme, Hong Kong is helping to channel overseas investments into mainland companies, provide a platform for them to expand overseas, improve their corporate governance, and enable Chinese firms to better compete on the global stage, Zhou added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, there's a gap in the number of trading days and hours between the two ends of the Connect scheme. Mainland investors get 90 minutes less trading time everyday than their Hong Kong peers, and 20 fewer trading days every year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the trading durations and regulations between the mainland and Hong Kong can be synchronised and improved, then “institutional investors like the [pension scheme] can help expand the Stock Connect,” Lou said. “We also face pressure to maintain and increase the value of our assets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The NSSF, established in August 2000, has managed a total of 2.54 trillion yuan of assets by the end of 2017, according to Lou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By asset value, the NSSF is the sixth largest pension fund in the world, after Japan, Norway, the US, South Korea, and Netherlands, according to data compiled by Willis </span><span class="s3">Towers Watson</span><span class="s1"> at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, the investment return ratio for the NSSF reached 9.68 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund has so far focused its investments in domestic, with Hong Kong among its key markets, Lou said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong attracted the largest number of initial public offerings ever for any single third quarter as the new listing rules implemented in April attracted some big tech flotations, while globally the number for equity market deals plunged 21 per cent to a three-year low, according to data from Dealogic on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forty-seven IPOs launched on the Hong Kong market in the July to September period, raising a combined US$16.4 billion, overshadowing the US$14.9 billion raised on US exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest listings during the period included telecoms tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion offering and food delivery service app </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s US$4.2 billion fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with Xiaomi's US$5.4 billion IPO in June, they comprised three of the top five global offerings so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the third quarter, the Hong Kong stock exchange also saw 126 IPO filings, taking the overall number in the first nine months of 2018 to 340, up 48 per cent for the whole of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The surge was helped by the new listing rules that allow companies with dual-class share structure and pre-profit biotech firms to launch IPOs, Dealogic said in its latest equity capital market (ECM) report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The post-IPO performance, however, has been “mediocre”, reflecting a sharp turnaround in investor sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/10/03/c5729c5a-c63e-11e8-9907-be608544c5a1_image_hires_105012.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPOs larger than US$100 million fell by an average 16 per cent from their offer price in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 30 per cent of the IPOs recorded a retail subscription rate of 15 times or more in the third quarter. That ratio is sharply lower than the second quarter when 77 per cent of the IPOs were oversubscribed 15 times or more. The drop in the ratio indicates a sharp reduction in investor enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165955/china-tech-ipo-boom-continue-least-another-year-says-china]Backed by the IPO activity, Hong Kong's ECM volume also climbed to US$20.6 billion, the highest third-quarter figure in eight years. ECM activities usually include IPOs, private placements, and transactions on the secondary market to help companies raise equity capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Hong Kong's hot ECM market was in contrast to the global landscape. Global ECM volume fell 21 per cent year on year to US$158.4 billion from 1,230 deals, the lowest third-quarter level since 2015.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing says he's proud of what he has achieved in his six years at the helm of Hong Kong's stock-trading watchdog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His main achievements in that time, he says, have been cracking down on so-called "con stocks, dolling out nearly HK$4 billion (US$510 million) in fines, and awarding compensation worth millions of dollars to hard-done-by investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The former chairman of KPMG in mainland China was an 30-year veteran accountant before joining the SFC in October 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His regulatory agenda since then has included casting the spotlight on corporate fraud, insider dealing, poor new listings and other white collar crime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A detailed look back on South China Morning Post's reporting of Tong's tenure reveals a top 18 high-profile cases which resulted in combined monetary penalties of HK$3.66 billion (see attached table, compiled by SCMP) for insider dealing, false disclosure, internal control failures, and mis-selling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peddling poor quality initial public offerings (IPOs) featured highly, too, with six sponsors fingered for failing in their duty to check on the quality of the companies seeking to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qunxing Paper Holdings and Hontex International were the two worst offenders, both having to repay the IPO funds raised to investors, after the SFC found they have given misleading information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC puts cryptocurrency regulation at the top of its agenda[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2168514/hong-kongs-securities-regulator-mulling-over-new-rules]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with the hundreds of smaller fines, Tong's total may well be over HK$4 billion in fines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't use the number of investigations or the amount of fines as my key performance indicator,” Tong said, in his last interview as chairman of the regulator before he has due to step down on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"What I am more proud of is the use of section 213 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance, which requires a person or company which has committed misconduct to compensate investors who have suffered a loss due to malpractice or fraud.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His crackdown on "con stocks” - low-priced penny stocks that are easily manipulated - also heralded a rush of rule changes and investigations, including its new "real-time and front-loaded” regulatory approach to cleaning up the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The commission is currently investigating about 100 companies and individuals and is targeting legal proceedings against around 60 of them, which would be the largest scale of litigation in 30 years by the SFC,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong markets watchdog to sue 60 for corporate fraud in first half of 2019[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2167906/hong-kong-markets-watchdog-sue-60-companies-and]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of its ongoing agenda are plans for a market consultation on tighter investor IDs for all market trading. Only broker identification currently needs to be disclosed at trading machines, with investor identities only needing revealed upon request.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Full disclosure would help surveillance of the market. When traders realise the SFC and the market knows who are trading certain stocks, they will behave better,” he insists.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Tong era, however, has not been without its setbacks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC failed, for instance, in its court order to extract HK$1.9 billion in compensation from Citic former chairman Larry Yung and other four directors, for not disclosing hefty forex losses in 2008. The Market Misconduct Tribunal last year cleared Yung and other directors' charge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest controversy, though, was surely the SFC's failure to land the world's largest flotation in history - </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> in 2014, which chose instead to list in New York, eventually raising US$25 billion - after the SFC refused to allow it to have dual-class stock [the issuing of various types of shares by a single company]. Alibaba owns South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I have no regrets that Alibaba did not list in Hong Kong because the listing rules at that time did not allow it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was not appropriate to grant an exemption just because the company was big,” he still maintains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have spent the past four years debating and consulting to establish a proper regulatory framework for such companies to list. Since listing reforms in April, Hong Kong is now the only market to have such a framework,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong names accountant Tim Lui Tim-leung to chair SFC[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2163273/tax-accountant-be-appointed-chair-securities-watchdog]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He will now let his successor Tim Lui Tim-leung finish the project with the stock exchange to expand the listing reforms further to allow companies, instead of only individuals, to hold premium voting rights, too.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After leaving the SFC, Tong is free to take on any independent non-executive director roles, be they with listed or private firms, and says he has received enquiries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I will focus my public duty on the higher education sector as chairman of the University Grants Committee before I would take up any other commercial appointment,” said the 64-year-old. "And I will try to spend more time with my [two] grandchildren.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung Wai-kwok, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, is in no doubt Tong has helped improve the quality of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Mr Tong has stepped up enforcement efforts to enhance investor protection,” Cheung told SCMP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He may have introduced some controversial reform proposals but at the same time he was also willing to listen to opinions from the market.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of Chinese start-ups trading on National Equities Exchange and Quotations, or Beijing's “new third board”, are eyeing flotations in Hong Kong after the city launched new listing rules this week, according to lawyers and bankers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some of our customers, who are now listed on the new third board, have shown an interest in listing either on Hong Kong's GEM, or the city's main board. They would like to list here, as listing in Hong Kong is recognised as good for promoting their businesses in international markets,” Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at US-based law firm Dechert, said in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which operates Asia's third-largest stock market, launched its biggest listing reform in 25 years on Monday. It now allows technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures, as well as biotechnology companies with no revenue, to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several enquiries but no applications on Day 1 of Hong Kong's new listing rules because of Labour Day break[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144085/several-enquiries-no-applications-day-1-hong-kongs-new-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM is the HKEX's second board. Previously called the Growth Enterprise Market, it does not require companies to have a profit record, but they need a combined cash flow of HK$30 million (US$3.82 million) in the two years leading up to their listing. The HKEX's main board is for bigger companies and requires them to have a combined profit of HK$50 million in the three years leading up to their listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In another move that is expected to attract more technology companies to list in Hong Kong, the HKEX signed an agreement with National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) in Beijing two weeks ago. NEEQ was started in 2012 to help fund innovative start-ups as mainland China's third exchange after Shanghai and Shenzhen.By the end of last year, 11,600 companies had signed up to trade on it; it has raised 400 billion yuan (US$63.06 billion) since its inception.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">e agreement will enhance the sharing of information and cooperation between the two exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The agreement signed between the HKEX and NEEQ has paved the way for companies now trading on the new third board to list with the HKEX,” said Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner of </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mainland rules require that new third board companies must delist from the board before they can apply for new listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, while the HKEX can accept their dual listing in both Beijing and Hong Kong,” he said, adding that this puts the HKEX in a better position than the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also said that while many of the start-ups traded on the new third board might not have big enough profits to meet the requirements of the main board, they could qualify to listed on Hong Kong's GEM. Biotechnology companies could also meet the Hong Kong main board's listing requirements after Monday's reform, which allows large biotechnology companies without revenue but valued at HK$1.5 billion at the time of flotation to list.Mainland rules require that new third board companies must delist from the board before they can apply for new listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, while the HKEX can accept their dual listing in both Beijing and Hong KongJeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner, </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, said NEEQ companies would like to list in Hong Kong for its more flexible listing requirements and quicker approval process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The companies that want to list in the mainland markets have to wait for months, or even years, to get an approval from the </span><span class="s3">China Securities and Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">. Although the CSRC has quickly approved some individual cases recently, the fast track is not for all companies. Many technology companies would thus like an IPO with the HKEX,” said Cheung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new third board companies that want to target international investors and raise international funding will also like to list in Hong Kong.This will become a major reason for technology companies to list with the HKEX. But the investors who want to invest in these companies need tounderstand that these start-ups have high failure ratios. They need to understand the risks of investing in the sector,” said Cheung.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> should have more power over listed companies to protect shareholders' interests, a study said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The suggestion comes as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the operator of Asia's third-largest bourse, this week started allowing technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology firms with no revenue to list in Hong Kong - the biggest stock exchange reform in 25 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities watchdog should be given more flexible powers such as allowing it to fine listed companies rather than having to initiate suspension proceedings as is done currently, according to a study on corporate governance conducted by two scholars at the University of Hong Kong and commissioned by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1"> (HKICPA).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new weighted voting rights rule is another evolution in Hong Kong's market. As with other developments it is necessary to ensure Hong Kong's corporate governance system remains fit to protect shareholders' interests,” Syren Johnstone, one of the authors of the report and a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said at a media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong rivals the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in terms of initial public offering volume, but lags behind its American peer when it comes to protecting shareholders' interests, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The global financial markets are very competitive, and market integrity is key to investor confidence which can be boosted by sharpening Hong Kong's edge in corporate governance,” said Raphael Ding, chief executive and registrar of HKICPA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government should take the lead and establish a corporate governance unit to protect investors, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong Kim Man, convenor of the HKICPA corporate governance working group, said Hong Kong needs to strike a balance between business development and investor protection to stay competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC should require listed companies to disclose breaches of listing rules when they happen, instead of waiting for quarterly or annual results to include such breaches, HKU's Johnstone said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The legislation is already there. The SFC can easily do it tomorrow,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also suggested the regulator expand existing arrangements to non-Hong Kong companies especially those from mainland China as they make a large part of the Hong Kong market. “The [enforcement] gap leaves investors vulnerable to abuse,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 90 per cent of total funds raised in IPOs and nearly 70 per cent of average daily turnover were attributable to mainland enterprises in 2016, according to figures from the HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Evergrande Health closed at HK$6.3 by midday, pushing its market cap to this year's high of HK$39.8 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm said in a stock filing after the close of trading on Monday that it had agreed to fully acquire Season Smart, which controls a 45 per cent stake in a joint venture it set up with FF last year, making Evergrande Health the electric car maker's biggest shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither Evergrande Health nor FF were available for comment immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF's founder, troubled Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting and other original shareholders, will retain a 33 per cent stake, while the remaining 22 per cent will be held by employees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF was founded by Jia in 2014 in Los Angeles to build electric cars that could challenge Tesla.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But operations in Nevada were shut late last year as Jia struggled to keep afloat his cash-strapped business empire LeEco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He missed an end of year deadline issued by securities regulators to return to China to address his debts. But he explained in an open letter that the key to address all the problems relies on the volume production and delivery of FF91, a luxury EV developed by FF.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese media National Business Daily on Monday quoted a spokesman from FF as saying Jia has managed to keep control of FF, as the company has a “dual-class shareholding structure”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although Jia owns only 33 per cent stake of FF, each share has 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares that Evergrande holds,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wanlin Liu, a managing director at the </span><span class="s3">Carlyle Group</span><span class="s1">, said while she saw a tendency two years ago for private-equity-backed Chinese start-ups to list on the onshore A-share market - shares trade on the two Chinese stock exchanges - more recently, she has seen more companies preferring to list on offshore markets, particularly Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While the A-share market had traditionally won out (as a market for private equity exits from their Chinese portfolio companies) due to the higher multiples that A-share companies tended to trade at after their listing, recently offshore markets, especially Hong Kong, have become attractive due to their transparency and more ready access to liquidity,” Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lock-up periods are predetermined amounts of time following an IPO when large shareholders such as company executives and investors representing considerable ownership, are restricted from selling their shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Controlling shareholders are subject to lock-up requirements under both Hong Kong and China listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter's case, the regulator and the exchanges have rules to also control the pace at which, and the amount of, how such divestment is allowed and completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A venture capital shareholder, for example, will be able to sell down any existing shares on the stock market equivalent to less than 1 per cent of the total issued outstanding shares of the newly-listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such divestment should also be done in a window of 1-3 month intervals each, depending on how long the venture capital fund has invested in the start-up before its IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules have no specific percentage cap that dictates shareholder divestment after any lock-up expiry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gilbert Zeng, managing director and head of China for </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> private equity, said he expects more Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong, after the exchange introduced its new dual-class share listing regime in April, which the market has welcomed, particularly for technology start-up IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition “due to the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connects [share trading links] in place with Hong Kong, many of these companies are going to [choose to] list in Hong Kong, instead of the US for example,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock Connect is the mechanism through which international investors can directly trade securities listed on the two mainland bourses via the Hong Kong stock exchange. Currently there are over 3,500 A shares available via Stock Connect.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But ultimately, the decision about whether to choose the Hong Kong or mainland bourses for a listing is also driven by the commercial considerations of the companies planning the move, Liu said, despite offshore markets being more of an historical preference by their private equity backers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of our portfolio companies had still insisted on listing as an A share, as [the management] wanted a lot of individual retail investors likely to buy their stocks, to know their brand,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It could be an advertising or marketing event for the company if their customers know that the company's A share price is going up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, exit values rose by a quarter in 2017 compared with the previous five-year average, to a near-record US$115 billion, with 710 exits completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around 7 per cent of that value was done through IPO, according to a Bain &amp; Company Asia private equity report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For mainland companies, some industry players said their preferred exit route for private equity investors remained through IPOs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an unusual act of disintermediation, Philippe Espinasse, former head of equity capital markets at Macquarie and Nomura, is advertising his swish apartment on </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He modestly describes it as "a stunning 2,400 square feet property with sweeping, panoramic harbour views on upper Stubbs Road in Mid-Levels." The property is clearly in a most suitable location being "only moments away from Frank Gehry's iconic Opus Hong Kong residence and the King Yin Lei Chinese mansion."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flat is being sold furnished and comes with high quality European furniture by Hermès, </span><span class="s3">Christian Liaigre</span><span class="s1">, Hughes Chevalier and Cassina. This attention to quality naturally extends to the kitchen which we are informed is very large, bright and high-end, featuring Leicht, </span><span class="s3">Miele</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Siemens</span><span class="s1"> appliances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There's also a handy wine cellar for up to 200 bottles. To complete this luxury package an Aston Martin V8 Vantage in mint condition is also included in the sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Espinasse sells his property as a result of its exposure on </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> this could start an uncomfortable trend for property agents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Picture perfect</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good to see that the government has chosen to commemorate its latest white elephant by using a picture of it to adorn the cover of the latest year book, Hong Kong 2013. We are of course referring to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a splendid photograph on the book's cover of the first ship, Mariner of the Seas, berthing at the terminal. However, despite its dramatic futuristic appearance, business has been less than dynamic with 27 ships expected to berth for a total of 48 days this year. Admittedly this is an improvement on its first six months when nine ships visited for all of 15 days. At HK$8.2 billion it cost more than three times the initial estimate in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was designed by Norman Foster's architectural firm, and the complex has been described by US lifestyle magazine Departures as "the Rolls-Royce of cruise terminals". Just what Hong Kong needs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What price change?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The debate over whether or not Hong Kong should change its listing rules to accommodate companies such as Alibaba rumbles on in the pages of the magazine Institutional Investor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue is HKEx's one share, one vote rule, which scuppered Alibaba's chance of a Hong Kong listing since Jack Ma Yun and the management control the board with about 10 per cent of the shares. Speaking to the magazine, Paul Schulte, chief executive of Hong Kong based Schulte Research International said: "Losing Alibaba was a strategic blunder for Hong Kong and the HK Stock Exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Alibaba is the future of finance, and Hong Kong is left with a bunch of old world banks. Asia is not exactly a bastion of minority shareholder interest, and there have been exceptions before."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx CEO Charles Li Xiaojia, it has to be said, seems fairly ambivalent, and is calling for a "rational" debate. While accepting Hong Kong's core values are "rule of law and due process," he says this shouldn't deter discussion about change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a survey by the Hong Kong-based Asian Corporate Governance Association, fund managers are overwhelmingly opposed to dual class shares. Shareholder activist David Webb told Institutional Investor: "It would be a 'race to the bottom' of regulatory standards and is not a recipe for long-term success."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It seems hard to imagine that proposals to change the one share one vote rule will ever get through the Securities and Futures Commission unless there is an unlikely change to the judicial system allowing class action suites.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How well Hong Kong's proposed new third board functions as stepping stone to a main board listing could be a determining factor in its success, according to Edward Au, co-leader, national public offering group at Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The more the proposed board functions as a pathway to enable companies to ascend to the prestigious main board, the greater its drawing power as a home for start-ups and other large tech companies, Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To help smooth the process, he urged for company disclosure to be of a higher standard than that of the main and GEM boards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ‘third board' emerges as threat to Hong Kong's IPO market[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1961549/chinas-third-board-emerges-threat-hong-kongs-ipo-market]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China new third board, known officially as the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), has developed rapidly through several layers of reforms but company disclosure and regulation still follow a different set of rules from companies that trade on the main board in Shanghai. This means companies will face difficulty moving up to the main board when they grow larger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong's GEM board was able to reposition as a stepping stone towards the main board because the company disclosure and foundations use the same set of rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The number of listings on the potential new board may be boosted if it is implemented in a similar fashion to the GEM,” Au said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of listings on GEM in the first half of this year has risen to its highest level since the inception of the board in 1999, Au said. A total of 35 companies raised a combined HK$2.5 billion (US$320 million), the largest amount raised in the first half since 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GEM is positioned for listing small and medium companies, while the main board is geared towards large companies. The proposed third board is for new economy and technology companies. It will also accept companies with a dual share structure if transparency, investor risk protection, and regulation is raised.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which runs the stock exchange, earlier this month issued a public consultation on the proposal to launch a third board, after the main board and growth enterprise market, with more flexible rules to attract tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two markets, one for large companies that match all the main board requirements but who cannot list here because they have dual-class stock structures, while the other will be for start-ups.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may expand its listing reform to allow more flexible structure technology companies to list, according to outgoing chairman Chow Chung-kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The planned move came as HKEX is facing heated competition from stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the US and Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council announced on Friday the launch of the China Depository Receipt (CDR) scheme to attract tech giants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's move is seen by local brokers as a way to compete with the HKEX to attract the largest technology companies. The HKEX plans to launch later in April its largest listing reform in three decades, allowing the listing of some companies with multiple-class shares and biotech companies without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the exchange will consult the market after three months on whether the reform should be expanded so as to allow corporations, instead of just individuals, to hold premium shareholding rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with China bourses for IPO crown[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shareholding structure is favoured by tech companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, as they allow the founders and key management to hold premium class shares with more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said on Thursday in a media gathering that the HKEX does not consider Shanghai or Shenzhen as a direct competitor, as the CDR scheme does not prevent mainland tech giants from listing in Hong Kong.We are always eyeing the US as the major competitor in terms of fighting for technology and biotechnology firms to listOutgoing HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are always eyeing the US as the major competitor in terms of fighting for technology and biotechnology firms to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said since January, some tech companies have inquired about the ability to hold premium voting rights as a corporate entity, a proposal which is under consideration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, we would need another consultation before we could move on this step. Allowing companies to hold the premium class shares would be controversial. It would be hard to determine which corporate should qualify,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market consensus is to allow individuals who are the founders or key management of the tech firms, to hold shares with more voting rights.This is because the market also recognises these individuals have important roles to play in the development of these companies.This is why the premium class of shares would expire when these directors die or leave the company,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Financial Services Development Council (FSDC), the government appointed advisory body, said in a statement last month that it believes the HKEX reform should be widened to allow companies to own premium class shares. The US allows such structures to be held by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The FSDC chairwoman Laura Cha Shih May-lung is widely viewed as a likely successor for Chow at the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow, who will step down as chairman on April 25, refused to comment about his successor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said he would like to see the listing reform implemented and the first application under the new regime made before he steps down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the bond connect as well as the two stock connects schemes that link the stock markets of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, to be the most important achievements during his six years as chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These cross border trading schemes established the linkage between international investors and the mainland markets via HKEX,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow also led HKEX's HK$16.92 billion (US$2.69 billion) acquisition of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012 as a way for the local exchange operator to expand into commodities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not have any plans yet,” Chow said in reference to retirement. “I may spend time more keeping fit and reading history books. I am watching the Chinese history video via </span><span class="s3">YouTube</span><span class="s1">. I am watching the 76th episode out of a total 100 about the Ming dynasty.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An escalating US-China trade dispute could be bad news for the initial public share offering ambitions of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges as companies would be less willing to consider a listing if the markets became volatile, according to accounting and consultancy firm Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It added that US tax reform plans and interest rate increases by the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> could spur a movement of capital away from Asia, another risk factor for markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The escalating trade war between the US and China will cause continuous market volatility, which will seriously impact big firms' willingness to publicly sell their shares,” said Edward Au, co-leader of the national public offering group at Deloitte China, at a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The IPO window is especially important for big companies. They may consider delaying their plans if the capital market is volatile. This is a potential big threat to the IPO market [for the rest of the year].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter of this year, Hong Kong saw 64 IPOs raising a total of HK$24.4 billion (US$3.1 billion), up 64 per cent and 84 per cent respectively from the same period a year earlier, Deloitte said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges in the same period, 37 IPOs raised a total of 40.7 billion yuan (US$6.5 billion), down 72 per cent and 42 per cent respectively year on year, as regulators tightened scrutiny to ensure the quality of listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange's US$3.4 billion raised in the first quarter ranked it fourth behind the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, Germany's Frankfurt market and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">. Hong Kong was ranked fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Deloitte said new listing rules to come into effect in both Hong Kong and mainland China are likely to help their appeal to companies considering a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong and China are both likely to implement IPO rule changes in the second half, which should provide a comprehensive set of listing choices for Chinese companies, including foreign-listed Chinese companies and tech unicorns currently considering IPOs,” said Au.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The two markets' new IPO rules will complement each and increase the region's appeal as a whole.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Deloitte maintained its earlier estimate that Hong Kong will see 150 to 160 IPOs in 2018, with a total fundraising amount of between HK$160 billion and HK$190 billion, up 24 per cent to 48 per cent from 2017. The city is likely to retain its spot as one of the world's top three IPO markets this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China exchanges meanwhile could attract 180 to 240 IPOs in 2018, with 170 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan to be raised. The total estimated IPO value reflects a drop of between 13 per cent and 26 per cent from 2017, as Chinese regulators are expected to continue tightening of their scrutiny to ensure the quality of listed companies, Au added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He anticipated more medium-sized firms in the internet technology, biotech, consumer and education sectors would list in Hong Kong in the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Shanghai and Hong Kong were the second and third top global IPO markets behind New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing rules include allowing companies with dual-class share structures to list and accepting the listings of biotech firms which have not yet turned a profit, as well as making it easier for innovative Chinese companies to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, meanwhile, has unveiled a plan to lure foreign-listed technology firms, with a proposed trial programme of Chinese depositary receipts for companies with a current market value overseas of more than 200 billion yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market regulators will not grant any special exemptions to ensure a local share listing for mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has piled pressure on </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx), which has seen share listings fall 28 per cent in the first half of 2013 from a year ago, by threatening to take the potentially US$15 billion deal to New York unless a controversial plan to cement management control in founder Jack Ma Yun's hands is accepted. If we want to introduce a dual shareholders structure, we would need to first do a public consultation, but at the moment we have no plan to do so Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEx</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US listing rules allow a dual share structure that could grant Ma and Alibaba management the control they crave. Hong Kong rules do not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be no exceptions," a top official at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the ultimate approver of share listings in Hong Kong, told the Post on condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source close to Alibaba said the firm neither wanted nor required a dual class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, it is proposing to use existing rules on board-level appointments to allow the firm's senior management to maintain a partnership structure to nominate a majority of board candidates, on whom shareholders would then be allowed to vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The company is not asking the exchange to do anything special for it," said the source, who declined to be identified. "This solution would leave all shareholder rights intact."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The internet giant, which is expected to list its shares before the end of this year, has more than 20 partners including Ma, his co-founders and senior executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, which own more than 60 per cent of the firm's share, are not included in the partnership programme, which was established in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A senior source at HKEx told the Post that the exchange would consider a scheme that did not seek to curtail the voting rights of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"At present, the major shareholders or management always have the right to nominate directors, which will be subject to shareholders' approval. As long as Alibaba could suggest that its nomination process would not affect shareholder protections, HKEx would consider it," the HKEx source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under Hong Kong's regulation, the SFC has the right to reject any listing applications and a source with the regulator told the Post that there would be no exemptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, the chief executive of HKEx, said after the results announcement of the exchange last week that the exchange put shareholder protection as its priority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we want to introduce a dual shareholders structure, we would need to first do a public consultation, but at the moment we have no plan to do so," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We would approve any listing application that has shareholder protection as its priority. Other markets may have different ways to do it and we would consider their practices, but at the end of the day, we would not sacrifice shareholder protection."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it is working with local and mainland authorities to fight to get Saudi Arabia's national oil giant, Aramco, to list in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest initial public offering in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For a giant company like </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the stock exchange alone would not be able to fight for its listing in Hong Kong. We are working with the Hong Kong and central governments and all related authorities to try our best to fight for its listing here,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, which operates the local bourse.Its listing here would be good for China, enabling it to play a more important role in the international resources marketCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are working very hard on it and we welcome </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to choose to list here in whatever format it prefers. Its listing here would be good for China, enabling it to play a more important role in the international resources market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing reporters after the bourse's annual general meeting on Wednesday, Li said if Hong Kong was in a position to launch the “IPO connect” scheme at the same time as the Aramco listing, it would provide an additional incentive for the oil leviathan to list here. HKEX is working with Hong Kong and mainland regulators on a link which would allow international investors to subscribe to newly listed A-shares, while mainlanders could subscribe to IPOs in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The existing stock connects between HKEX and the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen only allow investors to do cross border trading in companies already listed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be the perfect match to launch the IPO connect and the </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> IPO at the same time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco has already appointed </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> as one of its advisers for the flotation which is expected to raise up to US$100 billion, the biggest sum ever raised through a shares listing. That estimate is based on expectations that Aramco will offer 5 per cent of its equity, valuing the company at about US$2 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The state owned oil company is still considering possible venues for its debut, with New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo the main contenders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that since the Middle East and mainland China have a good political relationship, Hong Kong stood a good chance of winning. But brokers point out London and New York have traditionally been the destinations of choice for oil companies to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> two weeks ago issued a statement declaring it would ease listing conditions for companies linked to “One Belt, One Road” initiatives to help develop Hong Kong's stock market. A source at the SFC told the Post that this more flexible approach would apply to Aramco if it decided to float its shares in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is keen to expand its IPO market after it lost out to New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen to rank as the fourth largest IPO market worldwide in the first quarter. A lack of new mega listings meant the city lost its coveted No 1 spot which it had held in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the exchange would soon launch a consultation paper about introducing a third board for new listings of technology firms including those wanting to float with a dual-class share structure - something currently banned from the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He refused to comment about the 25 per cent cut to his bonus last year, the result of lower turnover denting the stock exchange's profits.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's snub of Hong Kong in favour of New York for its record initial public offering continues to divide market authorities. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) says it will go ahead soon with the second stage of its consultation on changing its listing rules to allow IPOs with dual-class share structures, such as Alibaba's. But market watchdog the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), has reaffirmed its strong opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba bypassed Hong Kong after HKEx rejected its bid for exemption from the one-share, one-vote rule so its founder and top executives could control its board membership. This newspaper supported the decision not to bend the rules in this case but welcomes a review to see if they are in line with the times. One question is whether even limited departure from the one-share, one-vote principle would be good for the international image of the Hong Kong market in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investor concerns remain, including conflicts of interest. For example, HKEx is a listed company on its own boards whose directors may face a conflict in reconciling efforts to boost the city's standing as a financial centre with the best interests of investors. And unlike New York, Hong Kong investors cannot resort to class-action lawsuits if they want to take action against an unscrupulous or incompetent controlling shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response to concerns, the second-stage consultation emphasises higher governance standards for dual-share-class listings. The SFC wants to know how many standards could be monitored on an ongoing basis and what public shareholders or regulators could do about it if they were not upheld. These are reasonable questions, since the proposal could blur the alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders. At the end of the day it comes down to the quality and accountability of management. The one-share, one-vote principle is not to be abandoned lightly. But it is bound to come under increasing pressure, especially from hi-tech entrepreneurs and innovators who tend to favour two-tier share structures to retain management control.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Financial Services Development Council in Hong Kong has pledged its support for the local bourse to launch a third board to draw technology firms and other overseas companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council, a government-appointed advisory body, in 2014 recommended Hong Kong follow Britain in setting up multiple markets to introduce different boards with different listing rules that are tailor-made for the needs of diverse investors and firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the council first made these recommendations, there wasn't much reaction from the markets and other regulators. Now it has become a hot topic recently as the stock exchange will soon have a consultation on the launch of the third board,” chairman Laura Cha Shih May-lung said at the council's annual media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing rules in Hong Kong have not changed much in the past 20 years. We would support such a review as keeping an open mind is important in attracting different companies to list in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week that a consultation paper would be issued by the end of this month on the launch of the third board and the review of the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rules on the third board are expected to be more flexible than those on the main board and the GEM in order to attract listings by technology firms, start-ups, overseas companies and those with dual-shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> prefer dual-class share structure as their founders hold only minority stakes but want to retain control. But unlike the US, which has drawn many technology firms to list there, Hong Kong does not allow this kind of structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said the council had in the past three years issued 30 reports ranging from proposals to improve listings, green financing and fund management in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many of these reports were the result of the studies by scores of financial professionals. The regulators have followed up on these recommendations but that was usually done in a slow pace. We would like to see quicker follow-ups in future,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides the third board, she believes the green financing proposals would be equally important for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green financing refers to financial investments and products like bonds that are issued to fund sustainable development projects and initiatives such as pollution reduction and the promotion of the use of renewable energy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many projects of the ‘Belt and Road Initiative' are related to green financing. Hong Kong needs to do more to promote green financing. Otherwise, we would lose out to other markets in the competition for the role as the fundraising hub for the belt and road projects,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched by Beijing in 2013, the global trade initiative aims to build more roads, railways and other infrastructure projects in the more than 60 countries along the route to boost trade and economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the Hong Kong bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said on Thursday he believed more companies would apply for initial public offerings under a new listing regime after the summer holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many inquiries have been made regarding the new listing regime. These companies' sponsors and other professional teams need time to prepare their listing documents. We hope they can file before the summer holiday in July and August. Otherwise, they are more likely to file in September or October, after the holiday,” Li said on the sidelines of LME Asia Week 2018.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After four years of debate and consultation, the HKEX kicked off its largest listing reform in 25 years on April 30, allowing technology giants with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology companies without revenue to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About three weeks later, however, only two applications have been received by the bourse - among them Xiaomi's mega IPO. The Beijing-based smartphone maker filed its application to list in the city on May 3,becoming the first company to do so under the new regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Hangzhou-based Ascletis Pharma, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in the mainland China, became the first pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing. It submitted its application on May 7.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No new applications have been submitted since. Li said he was unaware of any overseas Chinese technology companies looking to apply for secondary listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing regime has been around for about three weeks and we cannot expect all applicants to flood in and make applications. The candidates will need time to prepare for their listings. I am confident there will be more applications after the summer holiday,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stockbrokers too were optimistic about more listings to come under the new regime. “Many listing hopefuls will let their sponsors start the documentation for listing applications only after they have received the details of rule changes.This is why few companies will be able to file applications during the early stages of the new listing regime,” said Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at global law firm Dechert, said many biotechnology and new economy companies had expressed an interest in a Hong Kong listing, but they needed more time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think we will see many more applications in the coming months, as many potential applicants are gearing up for the submission of their applications,” said Chan.“I don't think it is surprising as the preparation of the listing application takes quite a while, and it is also relatively costly, so some potential applicants may want certainty before kicking off the IPO process.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks ended Monday morning's trading session at a five-day high, as investors were buoyed by rising hopes of peace on the Korean peninsula and incoming hot-ticket IPOs from Chinese biotechnology firms, following the Hong Kong stock exchange's relaxation of listing rules last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 1.5 per cent, or 458.09 points, to 30,738.76 by lunchtime, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.06 per cent, or 247.98 points, to 12,314.56. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.6 per cent to 2,508.02. Markets in China and Japan are closed for a public holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a rebound for sure. Lots of IPOs are coming into the Hong Kong stock exchange and more Korean peninsula peace talks are on the horizon, pulling stocks up such as Tencent,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Banks have also rebounded as investor sentiment changed. The Hang Seng Index is still under 31,000, which is quite a resistance, but we want to see how much turnover there is at the end of the day.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market was helped by a strong showing from financial and technology stocks, which bounced back from last week's declines. Insurance giants AIA and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced 2 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively, after Ping An's spin-off health care app Ping An Good Doctor raised a staggering US$1.1 billion from its hotly anticipated IPO on Friday.Lots of IPOs are coming into the Hong Kong stock exchange and more Korean peninsula peace talks are on the horizon, pulling stocks up such as TencentLouise Tse, </span><span class="s3">VC Brokerage</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Chinese firms rushing to jump onto the Hong Kong IPO bandwagon include the world's fifth-largest smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi, which hopes to raise at least US$10 billion, according to Bloomberg, and Shanghai Henlius Biotech that is planning to raise at least US$500 million, according to Reuters.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher on Monday, ending April on positive note, but analysts were cautious about the market outlook in May, as rising US rates could spark faster-than-expected capital outflows and US-China trade uncertainty could hurt tech stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index advanced 1.7 per cent, or 527.78 points to close at 30,808.45. For April, the index rose 2.4 per cent, snapping a two-month losing streak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, known as the H-share index, rose 2.2 per cent, or 264.81 points, to 12,331.39. It logged a monthly gain of 2.8 per cent in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board's daily turnover decreased 4 per cent to HK$93.6 billion from the previous trading session. The Hong Kong market will be closed on Tuesday for Labour Day and reopen on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland markets were shut on Monday and will also resume trading on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Rising US treasury yields and the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions will continue to keep the market under pressure,” said Ben Kwong, executive director for KGI Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher US treasury yields will trigger capital outflows from Hong Kong and push up interest rates, which will hurt equities, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tony Ho, director of research for China Goldjoy Securities, suggested caution on trading next month, as the trade dispute between the US and China spreads to the tech sector, which could strengthen the odds of “sell in May and go away” and sink tech shares, which drove Hong Kong markets last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Ho said MSCI's scheduled inclusion of A shares in June could spark capital inflows to the Chinese stocks before hand and potentially reignite the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, financial and tech shares both shone. </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced 1 per cent to HK$77.55, after its spin-off health care service app Ping An Good Doctor priced its closely-watched IPO at the top end, raising US$1.1 billion in Hong Kong's biggest offering so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> jumped 3 per cent to HK$8.32, and Bank of China climbed 2.4 per cent to HK$4.30, after China extended the grace period before it imposes new strict regulations on the country's US$15 trillion asset management industry to the end of 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> gained 0.7 per cent to HK$391.00, and </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">improved by 3.7 per cent to HK$130.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Lots of IPOs are coming to Hong Kong and more Korean peninsula peace talks are on the horizon, boosting stocks such as Tencent,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi rose 0.9 per cent to end at 2,515.38. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the world's fifth-largest smartphone manufacturer, is also looking to jump onto the Hong Kong IPO bandwagon, seeking to raise at least US$10 billion, according to Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange announced last week details of its highly-anticipated new listing rules, allowing companies with dual-class share structure and biotech firms that have yet to make profits to list here.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong generally lags behind in global trends. Economically, socially and legally, we're living in the past.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But let's move onto online shopping, an area that smartphone-loving Hongkongers should have embraced. Getting up-to-date statistics is difficult, but a Consumer Council study[https://www.consumer.org.hk/ws_en/competition_issues/reports/2016/online-retail.html#_ftn1] from last year comparing figures for 2014 gives a good perspective. That year, 23 per cent of internet-using Hongkongers had shopped online in the previous 12 months, compared to 67 per cent of mainland Chinese, 69 per cent of Japanese, 73 per cent of Germans, 78 per cent of Americans and 81 per cent of Britons.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's compact size and shop-packed streets may be behind the low take-up. But I've a feeling much of it is to do with not trusting online sellers.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The same is happening in Europe, Canada and Australia; it's inevitable when stores don't respond quickly enough to customer demands on price, selection and fashion.

The impact to our economy won't be huge as, by various estimates, the retail sector accounts for only between 1.3 and 3.9 per cent of gross domestic product.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is mulling reforms to grab a share of the US$40 billion of potential stock offerings from Chinese technology firms seeking to relist from the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx will on Friday announce the result of a consultation on a dual-share structure reform. Chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Thursday: "We are going to have some news on this reform soon." He did not elaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also confirmed a South China Morning Post report that the HKEx board had approved two reforms - a braking mechanism to check stock volatility and an auction system for closing share prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the details would be announced next month and both measures would come into force in the second half of next year to give the market time to prepare.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules do not allow dual-share structures - which give the promoters of a company greater say despite being minority stake holders - that many technology firms seek. After trying to list in Hong Kong, e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted last year to list in the US, where dual-share structures are permitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been a lot of debate over the Alibaba listing, resulting in the consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are a number of Chinese technology companies listed in the US that are now considering coming back to list in the domestic markets. This is because the A-share market is getting bigger and has high liquidity," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This delisting trend in the US would provide huge opportunities for mainland [Chinese] and Hong Kong markets. It provides both opportunities and challenges to the HKEx. We would need to make sure Hong Kong is attractive enough for these companies to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of the end of May last year, a third of the 102 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures, with 70 per cent of them being IT firms. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of the firms that listed between January 2010 and December 2013 were IT firms, according to the HKEx.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts estimate the market capitalisation of US-listed Chinesecompanies could amount to US$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August last year, the HKEx launched a consultation on whether it should allow dual-share structures and received a mixed response. While supporters believe a change in rules is necessary to attract listings, others worry it would affect the standard of investor protection in the local market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far this year, seven overseas-listed Chinese firms, including </span><span class="s3">Qihoo 360 Technology</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Sungy Mobile</span><span class="s1"> and WX Pharma, have gone private and are expected to relist in the mainland market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council and regulatory bodies have publicly voiced support for fast-track domestic listing of US-listed enterprises. Qianhai, in Shenzhen, has already expressed its interest in building an "offshore exchange" to allow overseas companies to list or dually list in the new economic zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas Chinese internet stocks are trading at a much lower price-earnings multiple than their counterparts at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While overseas online games companies are trading at 19 times earnings, the ratio for their domesticrivals is 108, according to a </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> report. Similarly, the ratio for overseas e-commerce goods providers is 55, against 320 in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the operator of the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong, is likely to report a 27 per cent jump in profit for 2017 on Wednesday on the back of higher stock market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The exchange is widely expected to have strong profit growth in 2017 as the market turnover is so strong,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for financial services and a broker. “The </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has also started to generate higher revenue and the number of new listings is also getting higher, which should boost the profitability of the HKEX up by about 30 per cent from last year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily turnover in 2017 stood at HK$88.2 billion, up 32 per cent from HK$66.9 billion in 2016. The exchange earns its income from trading fee paid by investors on each stock transaction, which means a higher turnover results in higher income.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee was another major income source for the exchange in 2017 as a record 174 companies launched initial public offerings. However, since there were no blockbuster IPOs the total funds raised dropped 34 per cent to HK$128.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange last Friday announced that it would bring forward the listing reform from June to late April when it will start accepting IPO applications from biotech companies without revenue or giant new economy companies with dual class share structure to list in Hong Kong. The reform will also allow large companies now listed in the US and the UK to apply for secondary listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Citi Research report, led by analyst Darwin Lam, said it expected such companies to start applying for listings in Hong Kong from May, which would boost the outlook of HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We reiterate our view that the listing regime changes are a milestone for the Hong Kong stock market, which should help strengthen HKEX's listing hub status,” Lam said in the report after the exchange's announcement on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has a“buy” rating on the HKEX and a target price at HK$330. The stock closed at HK$285.8 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank CICC was even more bullish giving the HKEX stock a target price of HK$400 as it believes stronger-than-expected market turnover was likely to continue this year and next.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Average daily turnover in January reached HK160 billion, up 181 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the driving forces for the rising turnover was the southbound flow from Chinese investors via the two stock connect between mainland exchanges and Hong Kong, which represented almost 10 per cent of daily turnover on some days last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's relaxation on foreign ownership in financial joint ventures and its push on New Silk Road projects is set to boost mergers and acquisitions next year, amounting to global deals potentially worth US$3.2 trillion, up 23 per cent from this year's expected total, according to international law firm Baker McKenzie.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mergers and acquisitions in China will grow to US$278 billion in 2018, reflecting a gain of 16 per cent from US$240.2 billion in 2017, according to the law firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to a relaxation of rules on foreign investment, investors purchasing stakes in mainland companies is expected to grow to US$47.9 billion in 2018, up 73 per from US$28.1 billion in 2017, the law firm said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China announced on Friday it would eliminate ownership caps on joint ventures in the financial services sector in five years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's outbound investment dropped 30 per cent in the first nine months this year to US$118 billion after Beijing tightened rules in an effort to curb extravagant investment by Chinese companies overseas. Baker McKenzie believes a policy U-turn will be unveiled next year as the strengthening of the yuan reduces the need for administrative curbs on capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, additional merger and acquisition activity can be expected as more Chinese companies compete to invest in infrastructure projects related to the Belt and Road initiative.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are optimistic about the long-term growth of China M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions]. It is true that China's capital control and foreign investment restrictions have had some negative impact on the country's outbound investment in select sectors," said Stanley Jia, chief representative of Baker McKenzie's Beijing office.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These measures, however, will help to foster a more sustainable ecosystem that would not only be more favourable for Corporate China's outbound investment strategies but also beneficial to the country's economic development in the long run," Jia said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An uptick in listing activity is also expected, with the value of global cross border IPOs to reach US$66 billion in 2018, Baker McKenzie said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors have mixed views on the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s consultation exercise for a change in listing rules to accommodate companies with dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> found a wide range of reactions when it conducted a survey of its members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some fund houses oppose changing the rule to allow companies with a dual-share structure to list here as that would allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. They fear this would affect investor protection," association chairman Bruno Lee Kam-wing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, there are others who believe we should consider a rule change to allow technology companies like Alibaba [Group Holding] to list. They believe the current regulations cost us the opportunity to have such a mega company list here and hurt the competitiveness of the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEx consultation, which runs until the end of this month, follows its refusal in October last year to exempt Alibaba from the ban on dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of its board members even though they only hold a minority stake. Alibaba listed in the United States in September in the world's largest flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has banned dual-share structures since 1989, with Swire Pacific the only exception because its two classes of shares were issued before the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">'s head of corporate governance David Smith said he would prefer HKEx to maintain the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is not lagging the world at all as most Asian and Western markets do not allow such structures," Smith said. "The US is the largest market that allows companies with a dual-share structure to list, but it also allows investors to use class actions to sue the companies or directors while Hong Kong does not allow class action."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that if Hong Kong changed its rules to allow dual-share structures, listing hopefuls and their bankers would think of different "creative shareholding" structures to protect the interests of major shareholders or management at the expense of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If many new listings and existing companies shift to a dual-share structure, it would limit the pool of single-share-structure companies for investors," he said. "Investors would prefer investing in a company with a single-class share structure to a company with a dual-class structure. One share, one vote is the best."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith said his fund invested in dual-share-class companies with good management, such as Swire, and there was a variety of models for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two classes of Swire shares carried the same voting rights but had different dividend payment levels, while some dual-share-structure companies had sunset provisions that turned shares with more voting rights into ordinary shares when they were transferred, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We invest in a company for the long term or forever if possible," he said. "As such, we want to make sure we have the voting right to remove poorly performing management or directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If a company lists in a way that ensures the management cannot be removed, we will have to question why it is doing that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shareholders will support any management if it can bring profit and benefit to shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some believe dual-share structures should be allowed as long as the risks are disclosed, Smith said passive fund managers would have no choice but invest according to the weighting of the index. That would mean that if some dual-share firms were added to an index, they would be forced to invest in those companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun Hung Kai Financial executive director Joseph Tong Tang said Hong Kong could consider changing the listing rules as long as additional measures were put in place to safeguard shareholder interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many technology firms have good prospects but their founding members only hold minority stakes," Tong said. "Hong Kong could be more flexible in our rules to attract these companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Securities Association chairman Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak said brokers had reservations about a rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The dual-share structure would create unequal treatment of shareholders," Chan said. "It would be good to have more new listings but we do not want this at the expense of having two classes of shareholders, with some having more say than others."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lei Jun, the entrepreneur who took a mere seven years to create the world's fourth-largest phone maker, put on a brave face as he presented the largest global stock offer of 2018 to retail investors, even as he pushed back against the Chinese government's strong-arm tactics to split his fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker that went from start-up to 100 billion yuan (US$16 billion) in global sales in seven years, represents a “new species” of company in the technology industry because it's a hardware maker that makes money from internet services, Lei said during a 90-minute presentation at the </span><span class="s3">Four Seasons Hotel</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi is a new species, in a class of its own,” Lei said in Mandarin Chinese. “Rather than explaining whether it's a hardware maker or an internet firm, I would say Xiaomi is an all-rounded company that can do well in all three aspects of hardware, e-commerce and retail, and internet services.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The identity of the company, whose name means millet in Chinese, is the crux in Lei's plan for tapping the global markets for capital, and for turning his Beijing-based company into a global player.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi will offer 2.179 billion shares at between HK$17 and HK$22 billion each on June 25, raising up to HK$47.95 billion (US$6.1 billion) in Hong Kong, valuing the entire company at between HK$54 billion and HK$70 billion. The world's biggest IPO this year will begin trading on July 9, according to a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's what Xiaomi said about CEO's US$1.5 b stock award, producing space rockets[http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2152160/heres-what-xiaomi-said-about-ceos-us15-b-stock-award-producing-space-rockets]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lei, who turns 49 in December, has had a challenging time convincing investors to buy into his business model, which he dubs the “triathlon” of technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It works this way: Xiaomi would sell hardware at a profit margin capped at 5 per cent, using an efficient and cost-effective new retail channel to attract as many users as possible. The company would then provide engaging internet services for users, to create new sources of revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A honest man won't be too unlucky because fortune favours fools,” Lei said, citing a Xiaomi employee in his corporate video.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/23/e1a48c9c-76e0-11e8-aa4d-d2a0e82fc143_image_hires_203645.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Xiaomi derived only 8.6 per cent of sales from internet services, but with more than 60 per cent gross profit margin. Sales from smartphones and devices accounted for over 70 per cent and 20 per cent respectively, the gross profit margins of which are both below 9 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Internet services is and will continue to be our major source of profit,” Lei said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source of profit is Xiaomi's ecosystem of more than 200 companies such as online video platform </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> and wearable device maker Huami, both of which have already been listed in the US. Lei, a serial entrepreneur, has personally groomed and taken several technology companies public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Exclusive : Rise of Xiaomi - the Chinese start-up poised to become world's biggest IPO of 2018[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142130/rise-xiaomi-inside-humble-chinese-start-poised-become-years]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There's room for Xiaomi to grow tenfold in the foreseeable future, ” Lei said, singling out three drivers - continued growth in smartphones, smart hardware such as televisions and laptops, both in the world's most populous nation and beyond China. Xiaomi claimed the largest share of India's smartphone sales in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have entered 74 countries, while there are so many more waiting for us,” he said. “We will continue to expand around the world.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi will be the first dual-class technology companies, the so-called weighted interest entities, to list in Hong Kong, after the city's regulator and market operator last year overhauled their fundraising regulations to compete with New York and Chinese bourses as the global hub for IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rules allow Lei to exert majority control of his company, even if he owns a minority of the shares. Lei, who holds a 31.4 per cent stake in Xiaomi, received on April 2 from his board 639.6 million Class B shares valued between HK$10.87 billion and HK$14.07 billion, in what The Wall Street Journal called one of the largest executive bonus in world history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong wasn't alone in wooing Xiaomi. China's securities regulator, anxious to offer more investible options to Chinese investors, had been persuading the smartphone maker to pioneer a form of Chinese depository receipts (CDRs) in Shanghai ahead of its Hong Kong IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a surprise pushback, Xiaomi announced on Tuesday its decision to postpone the CDRs, opting instead to raise capital in Hong Kong first.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“CDR is a major innovation [in China's capital market],” said Xiaomi's chief executive officer Chew Shou Zi, adding that the postponement was mutually agreed with the Chinese regulator. “We support it and feel a great honour to be one of the first group of companies to try this, as it reflects the recognition by the regulator of our status. But after several months of hard work to ensure the success of the CDR trial, we have decided to go public in Hong Kong first, and pick an appropriate time to issue CDRs at a later stage. ”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi had intended to use 30 per cent of the proceeds for research and development, 30 per cent to expand and strengthen its capability in the so-called internet of things, 30 per cent for global expansion, and the rest for working capital and other corporate purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the company remains committed to its business model, which puts a 5 per cent limit on the profit margin of every piece of hardware - from smartphones to suitcases and ballpoint pens - that it sells.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want customers to feel that our price is honest,” Lei said. “What we are after is the customer's heart, more than the profit.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Good companies earn money,” he said. “Great companies earn trust. Xiaomi wants to become a great company.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For A-share IPOs, the measures introduced by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in June 2015 to cap the first-day gains at 44 per cent to tame speculative price swings, have turned out to be a “sure win” for issuers and investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All 432 initial public offerings in 2017, and 53 in the first five months of this year have ended with price gains of 43-44 per cent on the first day of trading, according to Bloomberg data. Moreover, the downward price limit of 64 per cent from the offer price set by the bourses has never been triggered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, regulators have emphasised that such attempts to control first-day trading is to maintain market order. This is in stark contrast to other markets where market forces determine the prices as dictated by demand and supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/264ba390-657e-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_210526.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another form of price control, which has been in place since 2001, allows daily stock swings of 10 per cent in either direction. This means that if the price of a stock rises above or falls below 10 per cent from the previous day's close, then any buying or selling can only be done at prices within that upper or lower limit.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader and a managing partner at EY, says the two price controls combined mean that investors in A-share IPOs were almost “guaranteed” they have been given a “sure-win” ticket. Once they have their new share allotment they could then profit by selling their holdings within the first few days of the debut.In previous years, share prices of newly listed stocks have shown to be on a continuously upward trend for a period of 11-12 daysRingo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader and a managing partner, EY</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In previous years, share prices of newly listed stocks have shown to be on a continuously upward trend for a period of 11-12 days. This has dropped to a few days during this quarter as some of these stocks traded down briefly after,” said Choi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the 432 stocks that were listed in 2017, all but two stocks traded below their offer price six months after their debut, according to data from Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What this means is that the price-to-earnings multiples of these stocks will continue to go up post-debut, which can be a much-desired outcome for issuers. This is because in China, while there are no explicit regulations mandating the multiples that new issuers should price their IPO at, the industry has long respected a “23-time max” implicit rule that stems from a </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> guidance issued in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The guidance requires issuers to make more frequent mandatory disclosures before the IPO launch to highlight the fact that their new issue has been priced higher than the prevailing multiples that industry equivalents are trading at in the secondary market. This effectively deters aggressive pricing for A-share IPOs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wanlin Liu, managing director at </span><span class="s3">Carlyle Group</span><span class="s1">, said such continuous upward price trend post-debut has successfully attracted some Chinese issuers to choose the A-share market over other offshore markets, such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/01/26294caa-657e-11e8-82ea-2acc56ad2bf7_image_hires_210526.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It could be an advertising or marketing event for the company if their customers know that the company's A-share price is going up,” Liu said at a private equity industry conference in Beijing back in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, however, Choi said positive post-debut trading performance is only one of the attractions for an issuer. There are also other factors that a listing candidate would consider when deciding where to list their stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some of the technology or new economy companies, such as biotech, they tend to get priced at very aggressively high multiples when they launch their new share offering. This naturally will then attract some of these companies to get listed in Hong Kong, instead of China,” said Choi.</span></p>
