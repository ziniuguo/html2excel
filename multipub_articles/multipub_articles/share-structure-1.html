<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors have mixed views on the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s consultation exercise for a change in listing rules to accommodate companies with dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> found a wide range of reactions when it conducted a survey of its members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some fund houses oppose changing the rule to allow companies with a dual-share structure to list here as that would allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. They fear this would affect investor protection," association chairman Bruno Lee Kam-wing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, there are others who believe we should consider a rule change to allow technology companies like Alibaba [Group Holding] to list. They believe the current regulations cost us the opportunity to have such a mega company list here and hurt the competitiveness of the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEx consultation, which runs until the end of this month, follows its refusal in October last year to exempt Alibaba from the ban on dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of its board members even though they only hold a minority stake. Alibaba listed in the United States in September in the world's largest flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has banned dual-share structures since 1989, with Swire Pacific the only exception because its two classes of shares were issued before the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">'s head of corporate governance David Smith said he would prefer HKEx to maintain the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is not lagging the world at all as most Asian and Western markets do not allow such structures," Smith said. "The US is the largest market that allows companies with a dual-share structure to list, but it also allows investors to use class actions to sue the companies or directors while Hong Kong does not allow class action."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that if Hong Kong changed its rules to allow dual-share structures, listing hopefuls and their bankers would think of different "creative shareholding" structures to protect the interests of major shareholders or management at the expense of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If many new listings and existing companies shift to a dual-share structure, it would limit the pool of single-share-structure companies for investors," he said. "Investors would prefer investing in a company with a single-class share structure to a company with a dual-class structure. One share, one vote is the best."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith said his fund invested in dual-share-class companies with good management, such as Swire, and there was a variety of models for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two classes of Swire shares carried the same voting rights but had different dividend payment levels, while some dual-share-structure companies had sunset provisions that turned shares with more voting rights into ordinary shares when they were transferred, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We invest in a company for the long term or forever if possible," he said. "As such, we want to make sure we have the voting right to remove poorly performing management or directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If a company lists in a way that ensures the management cannot be removed, we will have to question why it is doing that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shareholders will support any management if it can bring profit and benefit to shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some believe dual-share structures should be allowed as long as the risks are disclosed, Smith said passive fund managers would have no choice but invest according to the weighting of the index. That would mean that if some dual-share firms were added to an index, they would be forced to invest in those companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun Hung Kai Financial executive director Joseph Tong Tang said Hong Kong could consider changing the listing rules as long as additional measures were put in place to safeguard shareholder interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many technology firms have good prospects but their founding members only hold minority stakes," Tong said. "Hong Kong could be more flexible in our rules to attract these companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Securities Association chairman Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak said brokers had reservations about a rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The dual-share structure would create unequal treatment of shareholders," Chan said. "It would be good to have more new listings but we do not want this at the expense of having two classes of shareholders, with some having more say than others."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Television Broadcasts (0511) chairman Charles Chan Kwok-keung said yesterday the shareholding structure of Young Lion - TVB's largest shareholder - has been approved by the Office of the Communication Authority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan emphasized the shareholding structure had been in place for seven years, long before Li Ruigang became an investor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Young Lion operates under the dual- share structure, through which minority shareholders may have the right of control over key company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I invited Li to take the place of the US fund [Providence] as shareholder. If that's all right for the US fund [as a shareholder], why is there a problem when the shareholder is someone else?" he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese media mogul Li, who is also the largest single shareholder of TVB, said he followed the previous shareholder's accord to participate as a stakeholder, in total compliance with local regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Jack Ma Yun's Alibaba was earlier found to be a shareholder of China Media Capital - chaired by Li - and which is a major shareholder of Young Lion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since Alibaba acquired a Hong Kong newspaper in 2015, rumblings are circulating on the possibility of a cross- media control. But Li said all qualifications were screened by the OFCA.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma Yun said its online payment unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> will come to list in Hong Kong only after the SAR reforms its listing rules that suit technology firms, a local report said yesterday. "All the existing listing regulations were designed decades ago before the Internet Age for property developers, banks, financiers and traditional retailers, and not relevant to startups and new businesses," said Ma. "We will list in Hong Kong only if we think the city is ready."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chose to list its shares in New York over Hong Kong in 2014, as the local securities regulator refuse to allow a dual-share structure, which contravenes the local listing rule of "one share, one vote".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba vice chairman Joseph Tsai said he does not have specific suggestions on which listing regime to adopt, but thinks Hong Kong should accept new things on a forum hosted by The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce yesterday."I think there is something to be said to move from a highly prescriptive regime to a disclosure regime, so than let the investor to decide what's appropriate what's not appropriate; let the investor to what's corporate governance work and doesn't work," said Tsai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But an Ant Financial IPO in Hong Kong does not need to violate local regulator's "one share, one vote" principle, as the company is not incorporated under a dual-share structure. The firm is valued at US$60 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has started consulting the market about allowing dual-share structures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has decided not to proceed with a second consultation on the introduction of dual-share-structure listings in Hong Kong after the city's securities watchdog publicly opposed the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange operator's decision ends more than two years of controversy over the major listing reform, which first erupted when it lost out on the mega listing of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing committee has decided, in light of the [Securities and Futures Commission] statement, that it will not, at this time, proceed with finalising its draft proposal for discussions with stakeholders, nor seek to put forward a proposal for a formal consultation as originally proposed in the exchange announcement of [June 19],” HKEx's chief regulatory officer and head of listing, David Graham, said on Monday. “It will, however, keep this matter under review."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba listed in the United States in September last year after Hong Kong declined to give it an exemption in October of 2013 that would have allowed founder Jack Ma Yun and other executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only owned minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms prefer dual-share structures, also called weighted voting rights (WVR) structures, which are allowed in the US but have been banned in Hong Kong since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC opposed the exchange granting Alibaba an exemption as it believes such structures violate the one share, one vote principle and are not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange issued a concept paper in August last year to ask the market whether it should study the subject. The exchange said in June its consultation had shown there was sufficient support to proceed to a formal consultation on rule changes in the third quarter of this year that would allow some large firms to proceed with such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC, however, issued a public statement a few days later saying its board unanimously opposed the stock exchange's proposal to introduce dual-shares structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx's listing committee said on Monday it would keep the matter under review, and keep an eye on future regulatory changes overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said on Monday night that he respected HKEx's decision not to proceed with the second phase consultation. He said many technology firms has delisted from the US earlier this year and planned to return to the mainland to list in the A-share market, which suggested valuations might be more of a deciding factor in the choice of listing venue than WVR structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SFC priority is to make sure that our rules protect the interest of all investors and to maintain a fair market,” he said. “As stated in our public statement on June 25, we were not yet convinced that the proposals on the dual-share structure reforms by the stock exchange managed to solve the problem of how to ensure that WVR will not be a common occurrence and the interests of investors will be fairly and fully protected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I believe that we should not change our rules purely because of changing market trends.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chief executive of Sun Hung Kai Financial, said he was disappointed by the HKEx decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Of course we would like to see the HKEx carry out the reform on the study of dual-share-structure listings,” he said. “There are some companies that want to list in Hong Kong via a more flexible structure but now the SFC has refused to let them in. We are going to see these companies opt for listing in the US instead.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong said the SFC or the stock exchange should consider introducing another new board with special trading rules to allow companies to list with a different structure from the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many overseas exchanges also have different markets for different companies with different structures or risk levels,” he said. “HKEx now only has a main board and Growth Enterprise Market, which is not flexible enough to compete with other markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sin Chung-kai, the Democratic Party's economic affairs spokesman, said he supported the HKEx and SFC decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One share, one vote is a very important principle to protect the investors in Hong Kong,” he said. “The dual-share listing structure favours some investors at the expense of the others. This system should not be introduced in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole debate was due to the demands of Alibaba. But I do not think we should make any tailor-rule change for any single large company to list here.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have a brand new market next year for “new economy” companies, allowing companies ranging from start-ups and technology firms with dual share structure to list, according to a consultation paper by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> released on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal, announced in the paper to collect views over the next two months, recommends that the new board will not accept any traditional or old economy firms, but only those classified as technology or new economy firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This will be the first market in the world that restricts the types of companies allowed for listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has a main board which currently requires companies to make a combined profit of HK$50 million (US$6.42 million) in the three years prior to the listing. The second board Growth Enterprise Market does not require a profit track record but companies have to have HK$20 million in annual cash flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither the main board nor the GEM has attracted many technology firms to list. Of the HK$19.4 billion raised by initial public offerings in the city last year, 69 per cent was accounted for by financial firms, with just three per cent from technology companies, far lagging behind the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Shenzhen's ChiNext.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Out of Hong Kong's total market capitalisation, financial or property companies account for 44 per cent, while new economy firms only make up a mere three per cent. This pales in comparison with the 59 per cent on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and 44 per cent on the </span><span class="s3">NYSE</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our IPO market is now dominated by traditional companies, while we have few new economy companies listing. The proposed new board is aimed at attracting new economy companies from the mainland or other international markets to list here,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX in a briefing on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope these new economy companies now already listed in the US or other markets would consider a secondary listing on the new board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Disallowing firms with dual share structure to list in Hong Kong is part of the reason companies have shunned the city for the US. With a proposed third board, Hong Kong may be able to compete for the US$49 billion raised in the US in the past 10 years, which represented 17 per cent of all IPO funds raised in Hong Kong during the same period.The proposed new board is aimed at attracting new economy companies from the mainland or other international markets to list hereCharles Li, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Singapore and London are considering allowing dual class share firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's proposed new board will have two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target technology or new economy companies that meet the main board listing requirements, but have a dual share structure. US-listed companies with dual share structure would also be allowed to apply for a secondary listing on the premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> adopt such shareholder structures as their founders hold minority stakes but want to retain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But firms will face trading suspension if they failed to properly disclose financial information or if the exchange consider them unsuitable to be listed. They will be delisted on the premium market if they were suspended from trading for six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Retail investors could also trade in the premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other market in the new board is designed for start-up companies. Neither profit nor turnover records would be required and the regulation would also be a light touch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There would be a delisting requirement where after a certain period of time, if these companies fail to meet certain operation requirements or if their share prices drop to certain threshold, they would be delisted. Firms that have been suspended from trading for 90 days will be delisted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is an easy in, easy out concept for the start-ups to raise funds easily, but they would also be easily delisted unless they work hard to prove that they have a business case,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since the risks of these start-ups would be high, the start-up market would be restricted to professional investors to trade only,' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said the new board would be popular with start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, there would be challenges of defining what companies are qualified as new economy, for them to apply to list on this new board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation paper also made recommendations to the GEM and the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The role of the GEM will be redefined as a market tailored for small- and medium-sized companies that do not meet the main board listing requirements and are not technology or new economy companies. All listing candidates should launch initial public offerings instead of private shares placements that are currently allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, GEM would be removed as a stepping stone to the main board, as the minimum market capitalisation for firms will be lifted from HK$100 million to HK$150 million, with annual cash flow requirement to be increased from HK$20 million to HK$30 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the main board, changes proposed include raising the minimum market capitalisation of firms from HK$200 million to HK$500 million and the minimum public float from HK$50 million to HK$125 million, as well as extending the lock-up period from one to two years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States allows companies to have a dual share structure but has additional measures to protect shareholders' interests, Mary Schapiro, the former chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Schapiro, who will meet Securities and Futures Commission chief executive Ashley Alder and other executives in Hong Kong today, declined to comment on what the local regulator should do in relation to calls for the introduction of dual share structures but gave an overview on her experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tension over such structures is mounting after the SFC last month refused to provide a waiver to mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's plan to use a partnership structure that will allow its 28 partners - mainly founders and senior executives - to nominate a majority of directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC said this violated the one share, one vote principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba may consider having its initial public offering - which could be as high as US$15 billion - conducted in the US, where a dual share structure is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is not to say whether the US way or the Hong Kong way is better. While the US allows some tech companies to have a super-voting share structure, it has a lot of compensation mechanisms to protect the interest of small shareholders," Schapiro said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These measures include the fact that directors have a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders' interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US law allows investors to take class-action lawsuits against a company or directors to protect their rights, while Hong Kong law does not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Documentation was also more demanding in such structures, Schapiro said. Additionally, super-voting rights may also have an expiry date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US market is taking a broader view of corporate governance to ensure fair treatment to shareholders and the transparency of the company," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Schapiro, who left the SEC late last year after serving for four years as its first woman chairman, is now managing director of consultancy firm Promontory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, she would like to see more regulation over dark pools, which are electronic trading systems that allow investors to trade large block of shares with no need to disclose information related to the trade.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for companies to raise funds, slipping to the No 3 spot behind New York and Shanghai, amid a dearth of blockbuster listings in the first half, according to preliminary data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's stock market raised US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs from the start of the year to Friday, a drop of 19.5 per cent from US$7.3 billion in the same period in 2016 when the bourse ranked as the leader for new listings worldwide, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> leapt into the top spot, raising US$18.2 billion, partly due to </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">'s IPO in March, which raised US$3.9 billion. The </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked No 2 globally, having raised US$9.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/25/dcd96210-5985-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_202320.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the funds raised in Hong Kong during the first half, financials accounted for 59 per cent, while technology firms raised only 0.8 per cent, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has lost out to the US as we do not have many new technology or new economy companies while New York has attract these companies. I thus support the stock exchange's proposal to launch a new board to attract these new economy companies,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), operator of the local equity and derivative exchanges, released a proposal on June 16 to launch a new board next year, which will operate independently from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, but with more flexible rules to attract tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board will have two markets - one for large companies that match all the main board requirements but have dual-share stock structures -- while the other will be for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QR68LM3]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Disallowing firms with a dual-share structure to list in Hong Kong is part of the reason companies have shunned the city for New York, which permits the practise. Snap, the parent company of messaging app Snapchat, listed in New York under a dual shares structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung said the establishment of a new board which permits dual share structure firms will help Hong Kong to compete with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We do not just want the technology to have IPOs here, but we also want to see those technology firms now listed in the US to consider listing in Hong Kong,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some fund managers oppose the dual share structure saying it is unfair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total equity funds raised in the first half year in Hong Kong, comprised mostly of new listings, shares placements, and right issues, amounted to US$15.7 billion, which is up 9.5 per cent from the first half in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out to Singapore in a survey of regional corporate governance standards because it still does not have an independent audit regulator, according to a joint report by CLSA and the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Corporate Governance Watch 2016 is a biannual study that tracks the corporate governance of more than 1,000 companies across 12 Asia-Pacific markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia, which was included in the survey for the first time, was ranked top with a total score of 78.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore grabbed the second spot with a score of 67, nudging ahead of Hong Kong on 65. Mainland China ranked tenth in the report on 45, ahead of the Philippines on 38 and Indonesia on 36.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong topped the last survey, in 2014, and was also placed first in 2007. Singapore has come out on top in five of the last seven surveys, before Australia was included.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results are based on a survey of fund managers and institutional investors to give scores that evaluate accounting and auditing, corporate governance culture, enforcement and regulatory environment, and corporate governance rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the launch of the report on Thursday, Jamie Allen, secretary general of ACGA, said Hong Kong lost out mainly due to the lack of an independent body to handle the regulation of auditors. The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">, an industry body, currently acts as the regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government wants to shift regulatory responsibility to the independent Financial Reporting Council, but this is unlikely to happen until 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore's accounting and auditing standards are of a high quality and policed by an effective regulator in the </span><span class="s3">Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority</span><span class="s1">,” according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said: “Hong Kong, India and Philippines are the three last markets not yet to have independent audit regulators.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore's recent decision to consider allowing companies with dual-class shares to raise funds on the stock exchange may lead to a decline in its corporate governance standing, he said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong got a high corporate governance rating as its securities regulator says a firm ‘no' to dual class shares, which violate the ‘one share, one vote' principle. Many institutional investors will discount a market if there is dual-share structure,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on the world's largest IPO two years ago when mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list on the New York stock exchange which allows dual-share structures. Hong Kong banned dual-class shares in the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, was denied an exemption in Hong Kong that would have allowed senior executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only owned minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a different legal system and regulation to the US. We cannot allow dual-share structure here just because the US is doing it,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he supports the listing reforms proposed jointly by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, which suggest setting up two new committees with equal representation from both sides. One committee would set listing policies while the other would approve complicated new listing applications.We cannot allow dual-share structure here [in Hong Kong] just because the US is doing itJamie Allen, secretary general, ACGA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen disagrees with opponents of the reform who say it would hand too much power to the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said: “There are many new listings that have corporate governance problems, and the listing reform would help address the problem and enhance market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be better to let the SFC be the sole regulator for listing matters, but it would take a long-term debate for that to happen. The proposed reform would at least be the first step to allow the SFC to work closely with the HKEX to handle listing regulation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another corporate governance weakness in Hong Kong, he said, is the fact there are too few women on company boards. Only 11 per cent of directors are female in Hong Kong, well below the 17 per cent to 43 per cent seen in overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a lot of smart women. It is a question of why so few women are on the board,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global head of thematic research, Shaun Cochran, said the firm's survey of 1,047 companies showed that those with good corporate governance tend to outperform the others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our analysis shows that better governance is associated with better fundamentals,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, accounting firm PwC on Thursday released their own corporate governance report onOur analysis shows that better governance is associated with better fundamentalsShaun Cochran, CLSA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed companies. It showed that Hang Seng Index (HSI) constituents stocks - the largest 50 blue chips in Hong Kong - on average had adopted better disclosure practices and new corporate governance rules than H-share companies, which are constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Chinese Enterprise Index (HSCEI).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The PwC Hong Kong's Risk Assurance division collected and analysed the data of 230 listed companies in the HSI and HSCEI, across sectors including financial services, real estate, retail and technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The study found 86 per cent of HSI-listed companies were early adopters of new disclosure requirements relating to internal control and risk management systems, compared to 60 per cent of HSCEI-listed entities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the reasons that HSI constituents perform better is because substantial emphasis and resources are put into risk management and internal control areas to respond to market expectations and regulatory changes,” said Kanus Yue, PwC Hong Kong Risk Assurance Partner. “The majority of HSI constituents have made an effort to increase their voluntary disclosure beyond the level of mere compliance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This greater transparency and the additional information disclosed helps investors to analyse the overall risk profiles of the companies and facilitates more informed investment decisions.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has edged closer to allowing companies with a dual-class share structure to list on the stock exchange after the regulator backed plans for a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) said on Thursday it supported the local bourse's proposed consultation exercise this quarter to gauge opinion on creating a third board aimed at technology start-ups and ‘new economy' firms.There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board would for the first time permit dual-share listings, which afford one class of shareholder more rights than others. Their long-standing ban in Hong Kong is widely seen as a barrier to potentially lucrative initial public offerings, particularly by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's decision to back the move represents a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it considered the proposal at the time did not carry sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January suggested launching a new third board with more relaxed listing rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board aims to attract three types of entity - infrastructure companies, start-ups and dual-shareholding firms. Li said on Wednesday the consultation paper would be ready soon for SFC approval before it is launched this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC supports the consultation to allow the public to share their views on the dual-shareholding structure," said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC at a media lunch on Thursday. "The SFC will be open minded to listen to the market comments. However, the regulator will only agree with any listing rule changes if it would develop the market and provide sufficient investor protection measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC took a different attitude to the consultation this time around because the dual shareholding companies would only be listed on the third board. Two years ago, the proposed changes would have applied to companies listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also need to consider the worldwide trend," he said. Singapore's stock exchange last October said it planned to consult the market on allowing dual shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using a dual-class structure, which is permitted in the United States. It is favoured by many start-ups because their founders often hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to allow such listings on the grounds that they would violate the long-held principle of "one share, one vote".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request to allow what it considered a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has since said that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs of new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players have mixed views on the issue, with listed firms and investment bankers preferring a dual-share structure while fund managers generally oppose it as they believe it is not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needs," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, who support the dual-share proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the third board consultation should be accompanied by a review of the role of the GEM, Hong Kong's second board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999 with the intention to attract technology firms to list, but it has failed to do so, now acting only as a stepping stone for smaller firms while they wait to grow big enough to move to the main board. Many new listings on the GEM have seen their share prices fluctuate wildly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After setting up the third board, we need to find a new role for GEM. Many companies only take GEM as a short cut to list on the main board. We need to make changes to address the problems of this market," Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wuxi Biologics (2269) spiked nearly 40 percent in its debut yesterday as investors who failed to buy into its public offering scrambled for a piece of the action from the open market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share price of the Chinese contract drug research and development firm closed at HK$28.25 compared to its IPO price of HK$20.60</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Chen Zhisheng said Wuxi Biologics expects to see sustained revenue growth in the next few years. Chief financial officer Lu Shaohua said the company's debt ratio reached 272 percent last year after it took out loans to buy assets when it opted to spin off from its parent, Wuxi Apptec.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu said Wuxi Biologics has ample capital after raising HK$3.98 billion from the IPO. It is the largest public offering in Hong Kong since the start of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said Wuxi Biologics doesn't see the need to raise additional capital after its IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biologics Holdings, which holds 75.43 percent of Wuxi Biologics, has a split share structure, with the same shares holding different rights and benefits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu said the structure was designed by a professional legal team and she does not worry about Wuxi Biologics being probed by regulators. Biologics Holdings has no plan to sell its shares in Wuxi Biologics, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wuxi AppTec is reportedly planning to seek about 20 billion yuan (HK$22.94 billion) in a Shanghai IPO, people familiar with the matter said in March. The A-share listing is expected to be completed this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lu declined to comment on Wuxi Apptec's reported IPO plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">G&amp;M Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (6038) also had a strong debut yesterday, closing at 50 HK cents from its IPO price of 41 HK cents, up 21.95 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chairman Lee Chi-hung said he was satisfied with the first day of trade of G&amp;M's shares, adding the firm plans to hire more workers to bolster operations. He said development of its office in Shenzhen will continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, </span><span class="s3">Guangzhou Rural Commercial Bank</span><span class="s1"> was set to price its Hong Kong IPO near the middle of an indicative range.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has offered 1.58 billion shares and plans to price its IPO at between HK$5.05 and HK$5.15, near the middle of the HK$4.99 and HK$5.15 per share range.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the narrower price band, the lender is estimated to raise about HK$8.14 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index closed above 28,000 points for the first time since May 2015 yesterday, helped by easing geopolitical tensions as well as signs mainland money is continuing to flow steadily into the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HSI rose 1.2 percent to 28,094, while the China Enterprises Index gained 0.7 percent to 11,374.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market has jumped roughly 28 percent so far this year, buoyed by China's economic recovery and cross- border investment. But even after the Hang Seng's surge, Hong Kong-listed shares still trade at a discount of roughly 30 percent to their mainland peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market turnover reached HK$105.9 billion. Stocks rose across the board, led by raw materials, energy and IT shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Tencent (0700) rose 2.1 percent to close at HK$326.60. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> (0005) rose 1.9 percent to HK$76.25.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The past week has witnessed a sharp rise in net inflows from the mainland, and "we believe insurance companies will continue to be a major player and contribute to southbound transactions," wrote Gao Ting, head of China Strategy at </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Those with high dividend yields or large A/H premiums and those that are scarce in the HK market are likely to be favored," Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks were steady yesterday despite a pull-back in the banking sector, as investors bet sectors such as airlines and real estate would benefit from a resurgent yuan against the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's blue-chip CSI300 index was unchanged at 3,834 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 3,363.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese brokerage </span><span class="s3">Guosen Securities</span><span class="s1"> is bullish on China stocks, after the Shanghai market held firmly above the 3,300-point mark this week, a level previously seen as a strong resistance. "Economic recovery is expected to kick China's A shares into a bull market," Guosen analyst Yan Xiang said in its latest strategy report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Currently, we could be at the turning point of the economic cycle," Yan said, citing strong economic data, robust commodity prices and modest inflation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said there were some good discussions about the dual class share structure and its role in the future development of the market after attending the first Financial Leaders Forum meeting yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s4">He said </span><span class="s1">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s4"> (0388) and the </span><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s4"> will follow up on the discussions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global stocks extended losses amid the escalating trade war after tariffs and retaliatory tariffs were unleashed by the world's two biggest economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng index yesterday lost 841 points as investors feared that the trade row would not be resolved any time soon, and the market is facing a sell-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors should be closely watching Xiaomi - which is seeking an initial public offering in Hong Kong - as the Chinese smartphone maker's recent moves are indicative of the jitters in local equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi yesterday said it has decided to delay its mainland offering of Chinese Depository Receipts until after its Hong Kong initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is probably because Xiaomi did not see a positive response in the market and so had no choice but to put the brakes on its CDR issue, though it had earlier enlarged the size of its CDR offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China A-shares have softened recently as the mainland market is short on capital. Several unicorns are to be blamed for this, as they were allowed to list without waiting in line.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These unicorns raised large chunks of funds even though they had not shown significant prospects for earnings growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some market insiders are critical of Chinese authorities who broke the rules to support listing unicorns and CDRs in such a weak market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's sudden delay of its CDR issue also shows that mainland regulators need to adjust their policies on CDRs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's IPO opens on Monday and as it will be the first listing under Hong Kong's new dual-class share structure, investors are advised to do short-term trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its cornerstone investors have been finalized and according to media reports, none of them are from outside China. This is understandable as foreign investors will be cautious in the face of the reignited trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The days ahead will be crucial for Xiaomi. It remains unclear how much the trade war will hurt market sentiment but the worst case scenario would be a delay in the retail tranche.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although some investors may not bite, lessons need to be learned from Xiaomi - whether it fails or succeeds - as it is an important indicator of the current state of the market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1"> made a weak debut in Hong Kong yesterday, with the Chinese smartphone maker's shares ending 1.2 percent lower than its IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors were selling at a discount on the unofficial gray market last week, Bloomberg News reported, and there was some selling interest at a 5 percent discount.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Xiaomi is the first firm in Hong Kong to trade with a controversial dual-class structure since listing rules were overhauled to allow weighted voting rights for different sets of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi shares closed at HK$16.80, after touching a low of HK$16 in early trade, compared to the initial public offering price of HK$17 per share. The Hang Seng Index ended 1.3 percent higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Indexes Company said Xiaomi meets the fast-entry rule of the Hang Seng Composite Index. Constituent changes will be made to relevant indexes after the market close on July 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1"> will be included in the Hang Seng Composite Index, Hang Seng Global Composite Index and Hang Seng Internet &amp; Information Technology Index, with effect from July 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's IPO valued the firm, which also makes internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, at US$54 billion (HK$424 billion), almost half the US$100 billion it had initially hoped for and below its more recent target of at least US$70 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At yesterday's closing price the company had a market value of US$53.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HK$17 price valued the company at 39.6 times its forecast for 2018 earnings, while iPhone maker Apple is trading at 16 times and Chinese social media and gaming giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> at 36.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2010 by entrepreneur Lei Jun, Xiaomi is described by Lei as a new species of company with what he describes as a triathlon business model combining hardware, internet and e-commerce services. "We are an internet firm," Xiaomi chief executive Lei told the listing ceremony at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. "From day one, we've set up a dual-class share structure. Without the innovation of Hong Kong's capital markets, we wouldn't get a chance to go public in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked at the ceremony if the low pricing of Xiaomi and some other tech firms will weigh on upcoming IPOs, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said it was not up to the exchange to have a view. "The market is always open. It's open to everybody. If you don't like the price, you can stay away."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi sold 2.18 billion shares in its IPO, 1.4 billion of which were new shares. The deal was led by CLSA, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is now the biggest smartphone vendor in India and is pushing into European markets including Spain and Russia, though it has lost share in China recently to lower-cost rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say Hong Kong's technology listings have struggled in recent months, deflating investor interest, while escalating trade tensions have made it a bad time to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Nothing can help because the sentiment is no good at the moment - most of the IPOs listed this year were not that profitable," said Dickie Wong of Kingston Securities. He does not see any upsides until the CDR listing, which would boost interest.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, an online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform, is bringing its sizable initial public offering to Hong Kong, where it aims to raise over US$4 billion (HK$31.2 billion), people with knowledge of the deal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm filed plans late on Friday for the city's second multi-billion-dollar tech float this year after smartphone maker </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">'s blockbuster IPO of up to US$6.1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping is, after Xiaomi, the latest company with a dual-class share structure to file for a Hong Kong listing, under the city's new rules designed to attract new economy and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based firm, backed by gaming and social media company </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700), was valued at around US$30 billion in a fundraising round last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is aiming for a US$60-billion valuation with the IPO, though industry insiders said it may have difficulty reaching that target as it is still money-losing and relies on a cash-burning business model to boost growth. The firm is likely to list in October, said the people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping's other backers include venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and DST Global, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and state-owned investment company </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1">, as well as the </span><span class="s3">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, chief executive Wang Xing owns 11.4 percent of the company, while Tencent owns 20.1 percent and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> 11.4 percent. Wang will remain controlling shareholder after the listing, the prospectus showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its draft prospectus, which gave investors the first detailed look at its financial health ahead of the IPO, the company disclosed a 19 billion yuan (HK$22.79 billion) loss for 2017, steeper than in the previous two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its adjusted net loss - which excludes the impact of fair value changes of convertible redeemable preferred shares and other items - was 2.85 billion yuan, smaller than losses of 5.35 billion yuan in 2016 and 5.91 billion yuan in 2015, the prospectus showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Bank of Jiujiang starts its book building today, issuing 360 million H shares. Entry fee is HK$2,214 one broad lot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The management expects the IPO to support the bank's capital adequacy by pushing it up several percentage points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There will be 98 new companies listed in Hong Kong's stock exchange in the first half this year, up 44 percent year on year, according to an estimate by </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">. For the second half of 2018, E&amp;Y believed that IPOs in the city will be dominated by retail, technology and financial sectors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said its legal advisers will investigate TVB's application to change the shareholding structure and see if organizations or people did not hand in full information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the counsel will also check whether TVB fulfilled the statutory declaration and legal commitment previously submitted to the authority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has already sent a letter to TVB informing it of its move and inviting a response as well as additional information. TVB replied that it will provide any suitable information.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The storm began when the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> revealed TVB's vice chairman Li Ruigang is the major shareholder after TVB applied for changing the shareholding structure by repurchasing some stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It triggered questions about violating the Broadcasting Ordinance, which requires the broadcasting licensee to be a Hong Kong local.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The repurchasing plan was also considered as another way to strengthen the position of Li Ruigang as well as his investment company, Young Lion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TVB said on Wednesday it has applied for a judicial review of the judgment earlier announced by the SFC. The commission has listed some requests, including disclosing the stake holding of Young Lion and all details of the stake structure, for approving its repurchasing plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TVB chief executive Mark Lee Po- on said the company cannot fulfill all the requests, which involve huge legal proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee also said it did not conceal any information about the shareholding of Li. He also noted it cannot expect the legal proceedings to hold up the repurchasing for a long time.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s bid to get itself listed in Hong Kong is facing a fresh obstacle because the shareholding structure it seeks to maintain contravene's regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although chairman and cofounder Jack Ma Yun and its management team hold a minority stake in the company, it is understood that they secure control of the company by major investors </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> through a strata common-preference share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange is keen to lure China's largest e-commerce portal, which is valued at about of US$100 billion (HK$780 billion), to list in the territory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, such a exercise is proving difficult to implement as current regulations ban the issuance of shares bearing different voting rights, people familiar with the matter said. Ma, who has had a rough relationship with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and is seeking to repurchase its 24 percent stake in Alibaba, is reluctant to lose control to the American internet portal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba may turn to New York if it fails to get a desired deal in Hong Kong, the people said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong rejected the listing of Manchester United Football Club in 2011 on the voting rights issue. The company then listed in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Alipay, the third-party payment system of Alibaba, which is not included in the listing plan, has reached cooperation agreements with 37 fund companies to provide payment services on their websites, the company said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland reports said the service will be launched next month at the earliest.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan tycoon Tsai Eng-meng has petitioned the High Court through a media company to appoint an independent supervisor to the board of </span><span class="s3">Asia Television</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Justice Aarif Barma gave Tsai his permission to proceed, saying there is a reasonable chance the application will prove successful.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the application, ATV management is chaotic and rows break out every few days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">San Want, a Tsai company, issued a statement saying that under the major ATV investor, Wong Ching, management is being unfair and prejudicial to shareholder Antenna Investment Limited, another Tsai concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It claims that acts carried out by ATV executive director James Shing Pan-yu, or the majority of the board of directors, exclude Antenna Investment and its appointed directors from any meaningful participation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The station is also accused of denying Antenna Investment access to full and proper information concerning ATV affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">San Want is seeking an end to the unfair and prejudicial conduct of Shing and the board of directors by appointing a supervisor who will ensure corporate governance in the interest of all shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">San Want believes the appointment of a supervisor will prevent further mismanagement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the ATV share structure, San Want owns 49 percent of shares in Antenna Investment, which owns 47.58percent of ATV shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Barrister Albert Luk Wai-hung said yesterday an independent supervisor is a member chosen by the stakeholder to be appointed to the board by court order.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The power of the supervisor is equivalent to the amount of stocks the stakeholder owns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Success in the application depends on whether the company management is out of control and the stakeholder's interests are being jeopardized,'' Luk said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rows between ATV and City Telecom chairman Ricky Wong Wai-kay have flared over the past few weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shing has accused Wong of photocopying ATV internal documents during the latter's 12 days as chief executive in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In turn, Wong has launched a defamation lawsuit against Shing, saying he has never even removed a blank piece of paper from the television company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A working group has been formed to examine a two-tier profits tax system, says Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau Yee-cheung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A report will go from Lau's bureau to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po once the research is completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau expects the effort to lead to a reform proposal going to the Legislative Council for discussion in the second half of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam suggested during her election campaign that a two-tier tax regime could relieve burdens on small and medium- sized enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal now being discussed is for the tax rate for the first HK$2 million of profits to be lowered from the current 16.5 percent to 10 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau estimated that there would be about HK$5 billion less annual tax revenue if such a reform was implemented.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the HK$5 billion, he argued, would be an investment in society as there would be a positive impact on overall economic development. There would also be a boost for the financial and technology sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Taxation Institute of Hong Kong</span><span class="s1"> council member Marcellus Wong Yui- keung said the loss of HK$5 billion would be a relatively small proportion of the overall annual tax revenue of HK$140 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the SAR could afford it and that it could alleviate greatly burdens on SMEs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau also said a </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> consultation on the proposal for a new board with more flexible listing requirements to attract "new economy" companies ends tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will be followed by HKEx reviewing opinions and then issuing a report. He said that on one hand there are many opinions in the market in support of a dual-class share structure, while on the other hand there are many concerns about corporate governance and protection for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So the need is to maintain a balance between development and protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yesterday also saw Lau introducing Undersecretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan Ho-lim and political assistant Pauline Yeung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau said Chan has broad experience in the finance sector and has also been a district council member.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He will help liaise with political parties and be responsible for work related to financial technology, green finance and the Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yeung is well versed in research work and is a talented linguist, Chan said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in his blog that Hong Kong should allow dual-class shares companies to go public as the SAR is expected to adjust the framework of the financial market to cater to the needs of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with the wave of technology in 2000, the development of technology nowadays has been further changing the economic structure as well as consuming behavior, he said, adding that the new economy plays an important role in the global financial market, as the top 10 companies in the world in terms of market value consist of many new economy companies, including Apple, Alphabet and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Chan said the SAR is still based on traditional economy, with financial and property industries accounting for about 44 percent of the stock market. Many fast-growing industries such as biotechnology and pharmacy have a low proportion, around 1 percent, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said it is unavoidable that start-ups raise money from the public. Founders of these companies want to maintain control after raising capital from the public so they prefer to debut with dual-class shares. For instance, Chan said Alphabet and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> all trade their shares with a dual-share structure in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) will provide a summary of the public consultation on the proposed new board which started earlier this year. Together with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, the bourse will introduce a new round of consultation on further revising the listing rules.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The briefing will be attended by David Graham, chief regulatory officer and head of listing of the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEx called on responses for its concept paper on weighted voting rights, also referred to as dual-class share structure, in August last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The shareholding structure is contrary to Hong Kong's current adoption of the ``one-share, one- vote'' standard, meaning a shareholder's right to vote is proportional to his shareholding size.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, the weighted voting rights suggest that shares can be classified one class-carrying, one vote per share and another class- carrying, multiple votes per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The idea was sought by Alibaba as a precondition for listing in Hong Kong in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It later listed on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> under such a shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse has stressed it holds no view for or against the weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia yesterday said the consultation result of volatile control mechanism and closing auction session will be released early next month.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has had discussions with Saudi Arabia's giant state oil company Aramco and is working "very hard" to win what could be a US$100-billion (HK$778 billion) listing, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking during a briefing on annual earnings by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388), Li said the Asian time zone and access to Chinese capital are key advantages for an Aramco listing in the SAR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It makes perfect sense for an IPO of this scale to potentially access the very large capital base of onshore China," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net profit for HKEx in the year to December 31 fell 27 percent to HK$5.77 billion on subdued activity in the local cash market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final dividend was down 29 percent to HK$2.04 per share, making the full-year dividend HK$4.25. The payout in 2015 was HK$5.95 per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Average daily transactions slumped 37 percent from HK$105.6 billion in 2015 to HK$66.9 billion, leading to a drop in income from transactions and securities clearance fees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of HKEx, Chow Chung-kong, said the operating environment for financial markets is likely to remain challenging this year, with many political and economic uncertainties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a potential "bond connect," Li said that as international investors are more interested in the mainland's bond market, a northbound connect could come ahead of a southbound operation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the stock exchange plans to conduct a public consultation on launching a third board in the first half of the year and will look at issues such as a dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that HKEx supported the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s recent actions against suspected manipulative activities in the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We really have to crack down hard on this because it is creating huge reputational damage to Hong Kong as a financial center," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the nomination panel of HKEx picked Cheah Cheng-hye, chairman of Value Partners Group, and Hugo Leung Pak-hon for election as directors at this year's general meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheah's knowledge of the fund management industry and Leung's extensive experience in the global markets business were cited as factors that would broaden the board's diversity.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Inc</span><span class="s1"> has filed an application to list on the local bourse and will become the first new-economy firm that will go public in Hong Kong under the city's new listing rules for a dual share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700) is the only truly mega new-economy company listed in the SAR today after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> halted its listing plan in 2014. Because of this, local investors are expected to show keen interest in Xiaomi, tipped to launch its IPO as early as June of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even before Xiaomi submitted its application, its planned IPO was already a major market focus. Some investors, though, are wondering if its potential market valuation of US$100 billion (HK$780 billion) is justified.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's planned IPO is expected to be the biggest in the SAR since 2010 and may be the fourth largest in terms of funds raised. With the scale of its listing, it is the type of new-economy firms that the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) strives to attract. HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said approval of Xiaomi's listing application will not be fast-tracked and it is up to the company to decide on the date of its IPO launch. After its listing, Xiaomi is tipped to be in the top five of the 50 blue-chip companies in the benchmark Hang Seng index in terms of market valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's revenue surged from 66.8 billion yuan (HK$82.44 billion) in 2015 to 114.6 billion yuan last year. It lost 7.63 billion yuan in 2015, but made a net profit of 492 million yuan in 2016. It lost 43.9 billion yuan in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A key Xiaomi issue is whether it is to be deemed more as a smartphone maker or an internet services provider. If it is the former, it should have a relatively lower valuation, just like other smartphone makers. But its valuation can be much higher if it is regarded more as an ISP. Founder Lei Jun said Xiaomi is more than a smartphone maker, although hardware accounts for about 70 percent of total revenue, while internet services only contribute about 8.6 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Xiaomi has yet to fix a date for its debut, the short-term prospects are challenging. Several new-economy firms which listed previously, such as </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (6060), China Literature (0772), </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (2858) and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co</span><span class="s1"> (1833), have seen pressures in their share prices. Investors need to wait and see if Xiaomi will start an IPO craze.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PwC expects Hong Kong to be the world's largest IPO market in 2018 with expected fundraising of up to HK$250 billion, supported by rescheduled mega-sized IPOs from 2017 and the proposed dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm said the proposed dual-class share structures will help the Hong Kong market to attract new-economy enterprises to come to Hong Kong for fundraising and enhance the diversification of its capital market. If all goes to plan, the first IPO under the new dual-class structure is expected to be in the second half of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benson Wong, entrepreneur group leader at PwC Hong Kong, is confident Hong Kong will continue to be the best financing platform in the region for bringing together international investors and mainland enterprises as the success of Stock Connect initiatives has diversified the SAR's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the full H-Share convertibility pilot scheme could bolster fundraising activities, together with the upcoming new-economy enterprise IPOs activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Excalibur Global, a futures brokerage services provider which will debut on January 12, said the 47 percent year-on-year drop in its interim 2017 revenue was affected by low investment sentiment but it recorded rebounded earnings from July to October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The group opened its retail book last Friday and expects to raise net proceeds of up to HK$85 million by offering 200 million shares priced from HK$0.375 to HK$0.425. Investors will pay HK$3434.26 for a board lot of 8,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Restaurant operator Taste Gourmet, which will begin trading on January 15, said eight new restaurants will be opened in the next three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company expects to raise up to HK$109 million by issuing 100 million shares at a price range of HK$0.86 to HK$1.09. A board lot costs HK$4403.9 for 4,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ophthalmic company CMer Eye, which opened its retail book last Friday, has brought in former chairman of Esprit Michael Ying Lee-yuen and Tencent Pony Ma Hua Teng as investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company expects to raise up to HK$571 million by offering 197 million shares at a price range of HK$2.35 to HK$2.9. A board lot costs HK$5858.45 for 2,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds raised will be used to open six new hospitals in 2018 and 2019 with a focus on the mainland as the company said Hong Kong was a very mature market and it sees a larger market in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Super voting rights for some shareholders in a listed company are not an international trend and interests have to be safeguarded, says Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Ceajer Chan Ka-keung, responding to Alibaba's mega IPO listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any changes must make sure the interests of the management, big shareholders and small investors are kept the same, Chan said yesterday. Britain rejected a similar move after consultation recently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He argued that Hong Kong cannot just copy the dual-share structure or class-action policies of the United States as the two jurisdictions have different laws and backgrounds. Local listings are screened by both the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s listing committee and the Securities and Futures Commission, while listings in the United States are approved only by the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, China's e-commerce giant, proposed listing in Hong Kong under a partnership structure, in which Alibaba's 28 partners can be given more voting rights to nominate a majority of directors. But it is against current listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also believed the US tapering move is good for the market as quantitative easing has distorted the financial market. He added that US$100 billion (HK$780 billion) of capital has flown into Hong Kong, mainly to the stock market, since easing started in 2008, but he does not expect a fast capital outflow from Hong Kong as the tapering is gradual.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial system can remain solid even if there is a massive outflow of capital, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu</span><span class="s1">, one of the big four accounting firms, says Alibaba could be listed in Hong Kong by the end of next year if the partnership shareholding structure is given the green light. It expects up to 100 initial public offerings in Hong Kong next year, raising up to HK$210 billion, up 26.5 percent from 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> estimates the local economy to grow mildly in the short term and expects an annual growth of 3.5 percent next year. Inflation might be lower early next year as rents have recorded a slower rise.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is Hong Kong's rival, and not Shanghai or Shenzhen, when it comes to attracting “unicorns”, according to Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Asian stock exchanges are vying with each other to change listing rules in a bid to attract new economy companies and dual-class shareholding structure firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen have never been competitors of Hong Kong as we always cooperate with each other. Tong said on the sidelines of a regulatory forum on Wednesday. “Rather, Singapore is a competitor of Hong Kong,” adding that if dual-class shareholding companies were to list in Hong Kong and in the mainland, it would be a win-win situation for both.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) last month said it would bring forward its listing reform by several months, with its one-month long consultation due to end on March 23. Thereafter it plans to change the rules which will take effect in late April and start accepting listing applications of dual-class shares companies and biotech giant without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend that they had prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting unicorns - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and had already visited a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, chairman of </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)</span><span class="s1">, the mainland's top markets watchdog, confirmed last week that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) too is also planning to allow dual-class share structure companies to list as early as July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX, said last week that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong were planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a dual-class listing structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC's Tong said Hong Kong's stock market will not be affected by China's plans to attract new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong cooperates with mainland stock markets but we are very independent,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, owner of theSouth China Morning Post, chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structure allows shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian stock exchanges previously opposed such companies to list because it goes against the “one share one vote” principle. But now several exchanges are speeding up their reforms to explicitly allow dual-class shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of SFC, said at the same forum that the commission found shortcomings in the works of 31 financial firms that acted as listing sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some listing sponsors did not fulfil their duty with regards to due diligence on the companies they sponsored, falling short of the SFC requirements,” she said, adding the commission will issue a report on the matter soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also said the commission plans to study some brokers' demand to use WhatApp to take customer orders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may be set to its listing rules and introduce the a dual-class share structure in the city, after </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it plans to consult the market on the launch of a third board in an effort to attract more technology and new-economy firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of the agenda is the controversial issue of whether dual shareholding structure should be allowed, said HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Thursday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX consulted the market on a dual shareholding structure two years ago, which would have allowed one class of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eventually the idea foundered, after the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> opposed the proposal due to what is claimed was a lack of sufficient investor protection - a subject which is likely again to dominate discussions this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow poor performers to exit from the new board," Li told a media briefing on Thursday.Consultation on the third board will include on dual shareholding structure, which companies should be [allowed] to list, and which investors should be allowed to trade. There should also be a delisting mechanism to allow the poor performers to exit from the new boardCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the exchange would be involving the SFC in the consultation process, in an effort to ease their fears last time, and investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We will have discussions with the SFC and hope to work out a future direction," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using duel shareholding structures, which are banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request for a shareholder structure, which the commission considered as dual structured.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has told the Post that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs or requirements of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse is also planning to launch gold and iron ore contracts this year and a primary connect system aimed at attracting international companies to list in Hong Kong, which could then be offered to mainland investors via the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect links, Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Major international players such as Apple or </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1"> might consider listing in Hong Kong and offering their shares to mainlanders subscribed to a new primary connect system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This will strengthen Hong Kong's listing market and offer more choice for mainland investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in his briefing, Li said the exchange continues to work on reforming the poorly performing Growth Enterprise Market, and is working on a bond connect and one for exchange-traded funds, which again could both be linked to mainland markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should only allow exceptionally big technology firms with multiple class share structure to list in the city to prevent poor quality ones from abusing the system, say bankers and lawmakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing rule reform is exciting as it would allow more technology companies to consider the prospect of a Hong Kong listing and allow investors to be able to participate in these new economy companies,” Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive of China Renaissance, a Chinese investment bank that has helped many start-ups and biotech firms to list, told the South China Morning Post in an interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it is very important for HKEX [Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing] to keep the bar high to maintain high standards while accepting a broader range of listing candidates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is in the midst of its largest listing reform in decades aimed at lifting the exchange's attractiveness to compete for more technology firms to list here instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June large biotech firms without revenue and giant technology firms with dual class shareholding structure would be allowed to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class share companies allow one class of shareholders to have more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders. These are favoured by many tech firm founders as many of them hold minority stakes but want to have control. Meanwhile, biotech firms usually have no revenue in the research period. The current Hong Kong listing rules do not allow them to list here but they can list in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at the US, there are in fact not many technology companies listed in the dual class share structure, but only the very large and successful ones such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abused.”The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abusedFan Bao, chairman and CEO of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX next month will issue a detailed consultation on the listing reform, but Bao wants to see more investor protection measures in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The view is echoed by fund mangers and lawmakers, with many calling for a “sunset clause” - a provision that requires these dual class share companies, after certain years of listing, to seek shareholders' approval to continue with the structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Struggling Chinese tech start-ups given US$800m lifeline from new China Renaissance fund[http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/1844762/struggling-chinese-tech-start-ups-given-us800m-lifeline-new-china]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing, however, told lawmakers during the financial affairs panel meeting last week that the exchange would not go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we were to introduce such a sunset clause, some tech companies might consider Hong Kong to be too restrictive and they may not come here to list,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenneth Leung, lawmaker for accountancy, said the exchange could consider setting a longer period such as 20 years for the sunset clause.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of letting the founders have special voting rights is to allow them to have control for a longer time to implement their vision. If they are doing well for 20 years, the investors would support and approve them to continue to have special voting rights. If they do not do a good job, investors should also have the right to say no,” Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When it comes to capital from across the border, should we immediately look upon it with suspicion as a reflection of mainland authorities trying to influence the city in some way? Or should we welcome it with open minds as a win-win investment, provided no Hong Kong regulations are breached?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This seems to be the big issue regarding mainland media mogul Li Ruigang, also known as China's Rupert Murdoch, and a familiar name in Hollywood.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I have many investments in the US entertainment business, I sit on the board of Creative Artists Agency[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2088545/china-media-mogul-li-ruigang-joins-board-hollywood-talent] [the world's leading entertainment and sports talent agency, based in California], no one in the US suspects that I'm going to turn Hollywood red. How come here in Hong Kong, some people labelled me in this way?" the founder and chairman of media giant China Media Capital (CMC) lamented recently.[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2099778/chinese-media-mogul-li-ruigang-says-hong-kong-should-create-open]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Admitting that "Hong Kong is a much more complicated place than I previously expected", Li noted that a non-issue in other jurisdictions could be a big deal in the city, as evident in his investment in dominant free-to-air broadcaster TVB. He was perplexed by the paranoia over "ranhong", or "turning red", a local reference to mainlanders taking over and controlling Hong Kong businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Soft power: China's Hollywood dreams not just about making money, says media tycoon Li Ruigang[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2063471/chinas-hollywood-dreams-not-just-about-making-money-says-tycoon]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li has come under the media spotlight as local regulators are looking into the dual-share structure of TVB after CMC's investment, amid suspicion that the city's most influential TV station is in fact controlled by someone who is not a Hongkonger[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2093832/chinese-media-magnate-li-ruigang-revealed-largest-shareholder].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local broadcast law requires the licensee of a TV station to be a permanent Hong Kong resident. Some have even gone as far as to suggest there could be an invisible hand behind Li's CMC - referring to authorities across the border.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, a household name on the mainland and a well-known investor in Hollywood, has come to realise that the controversy stems from suspicion in the city over possible mainland influence, plus a complicated share structure at TVB that is hard to follow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That explains why he decided to break his silence last Friday. Making a detour to Hong Kong on his way back to Shanghai after a full week of meetings in Europe, Li explained that he had nothing to hide regarding his investment in TVB and just wanted to include Hong Kong in his ambition to globalise his business.[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2099751/how-li-ruigang-chinas-rupert-murdoch-building-global-media-empire]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meeting the media to give his side of the story, Li also dismissed any suggestion of vested interests trying to control TVB. At one point, he became quite emotional, telling reporters that his home town was actually Zhongshan in Guangdong province, where his father and grandfather spoke Cantonese, but the family later moved to Shanghai, where he grew up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This link with Guangdong, he said, meant he had a special affection for Hong Kong. But more important, he genuinely felt Hong Kong could play a strategic role in the global entertainment empire he was building.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I have the capital, I have the resources and I have a passionate heart towards Hong Kong, and that's why I'm here." he said. "I hope Hong Kong can be more receptive towards me. I want Hong Kong to be part of my globalisation plan."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Understandably, Li may not be able to convince everyone yet. And, frankly speaking, it's also a learning process for Li to understand the "unexpected" complexity of this city in every sense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is no doubt that the rule of law should be treasured and regulations strictly followed. However, equally important is for Hong Kong to keep an open mind to facilitate a more welcoming environment for all qualified investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In this regard, the public debate over Li's situation does help clear the air for concerned parties.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-share structures for listed companies that are bolstered by safeguards could work in Hong Kong, a senior US-based lawyer said, but the city's regulator is not convinced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Terry O'Malley, global co-chief executive of legal firm DLP Piper, said a two-tier shareholding structure is popular in the US among some media, space and technology companies. The system came with investor protections in the US, where class action lawsuits are allowed and a company or its directors can be sued, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-share structures have come under the spotlight in the city after </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> lost the potential listing of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">. It is understood that the mainland e-commerce giant had wanted to list under a structure that allowed its founder and senior executives to nominate most of the board members, despite their holding minority stakes. The Securities Futures Commission signalled its opposition to such a move amid concerns for the rights of minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While O'Malley noted that Hong Kong's legal system does not allow class actions, he said the city could still consider other types of protection for minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It could require both classes of shareholders to vote for approval of some major transactions or for major issues such as changing of the board structure," he said. "Alternatively, it could also allow the regulator to have the power to prevent one class of shareholders to abuse of the control that may hurt the benefit of other shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is thought to be considering a listing in the US, where its favoured model could be accommodated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the wake of Alibaba's aborted IPO - said to be worth as much as US$15 billion - the Hong Kong stock exchange announced a plan for a consultation on whether the city should change its listing rules to attract more flotations. The government-appointed Financial Services Development Council will also review the IPO system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing told the South China Morning Post: "The SFC's [stance] is that any change of rules and regulations must put shareholders' protection as top priority."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Institute of Directors chairman Kelvin Wong, a non-executive director of the SFC, also opposes any concession for a dual-share structure. "One share, one vote is the name of the game," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said if a company has two classes of shareholders and one class has more voting rights than the others, it would be far too easy for one class of shareholders to proposed corporate plans that were favourable to them but to the detriment of other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shareholder activist David Webb, a former HKEx director, reiterated his support for the SFC's stance. Institutional investors were often cautious towards such structures, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global institutional investors are urging Hong Kong not to change its listing rules even after losing the mega listing of e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to a survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those surveyed, 54 global institutional investors managing a combined US$14 trillion of assets, warned they would on average give a 19 per cent price discount to Alibaba's valuation if it lists with its special shareholders structure intact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They also said they would on average put a 13 per cent discount on the Hong Kong market valuation if the city allows a non-standard shareholder structure to accommodate Alibaba-like listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong government and regulators should do nothing with the existing listing rules. The one-share-one-vote principle in Hong Kong has worked well for many years, providing all shareholders with fair treatment," said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the association, which has 100 global institutional investor members including some of the world's largest fund houses, pension funds and insurers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The survey, conducted on association members early this year, came after Alibaba was reported in October to be in talks with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange refused to grant the exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle. Alibaba last month said it planned to list in the US, which allows the dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba lists with the structure, 71 per cent of respondents said they would not buy the stock or buy it at a discount ranging from 5 to 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia has written several times on his blog since September on the need to relook at listing rules for "innovative" companies, but institutional investors are opposed to any change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Twenty-eight per cent of the respondents gave a "bad" rating to HKEx in its manner of handling Alibaba, compared with 2 per cent "bad" each for the SFC and the government. In comparison, 41 per cent ranked the SFC "good" in its handling of the Alibaba issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Michael Cheng, the association's research director of mainland China and Hong Kong, said some years ago London had allowed the dual class structure but that did not lead to more listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Chan, finance partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Berwin Leighton Paisner</span><span class="s1">, said: "In the US, there is a more disclosure-oriented approach as well as a culture of litigation. Investors don't need the exchanges to protect them as much as they do in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> would cut the number of partners the firm has and bind them to a three-year share sale ban if Hong Kong regulators accept a controversial management structure that is blocking its potential HK$100 billion initial public offering, a source close to the listing authorities told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal had been floated to the stock exchange's listing committee ahead of a regular meeting tomorrow, but no formal listing application had yet been submitted, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is aimed at showing that Alibaba is willing to make concessions," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source close to the Securities and Futures Commission said such a concession was unlikely to be enough to persuade the authorities to accept the Alibaba structure. "Alibaba will still not give up its demand to nominate the majority of board directors, which still gives more power to certain shareholders than others. That is unacceptable to the SFC," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Share lock-ups for executives are not uncommon in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had no comment, but a source close to the company said talks were continuing and constructive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The e-commerce giant's planned listing is in limbo over its management's determination to maintain a partnership structure that regulators worry gives top executives more rights than ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources close to Alibaba insist the firm does not want a dual share structure or a change to rules. Instead, it is seeking an exemption under an existing rule that is part of the Hong Kong listing code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun revealed fresh details about the partnership scheme earlier this month that analysts saw as being designed to soothe concerns. The scheme started in 2010 and had elected 28 partners over a three-round selection process following strict eligibility criteria.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and his top executives own about 10 per cent of the company, compared with about 24 per cent owned by United States internet firm </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and about 37 per cent by Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment bankers who have met Ma have told him that a New York listing would be his best bet for securing the control he craves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival, Nasdaq, are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial experts say, however, that Alibaba has missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and it may have only until the end of this month before the same happens in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any later and the application would be subject to new rules that come into effect on October 1, obliging firms to allow at least two months between the date of a sponsor's formal appointment and a listing application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said after the first anniversary ceremony of its joint venture with the two mainland stock exchanges yesterday that the city's listing rules were working well and there was no reason to change them to accommodate dual share structures, in the latest sign that the regulatory stand-off remains unresolved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked about the status of the potential listing of Alibaba, Li reiterated that Hong Kong's listing regime was designed to protect all shareholders equally, underscoring the reservations that the regulators have about the company's structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong brokers and accountants are giving their support to </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in exploring a new market with lower listing criteria for start-ups but many are not in favour of the controversial dual shares structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, from </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1">, said Hong Kong either needed a new market or it should revamp the second board - the Growth Enterprise Market - to lower the entry requirements to allow start-ups to raise money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong government wants to use taxpayers' money to help youngsters set up their companies which is a mistake as many new start-ups fail. The government should not use taxpayers' money for risky business. Instead, it should encourage the HKEX to introduce a platform for them to raise funds,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan is backing HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia who said on Thursday that he was considering all methods - including a new board with low listing thresholds for technology firms and start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At present, the main board requires companies to have made HK$50 million over three years before seeking a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/09/01/c7e81024-703b-11e6-af03-e675d0741f8a_image_hires.jpg]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM, launched in 1999, was intended to be Hong Kong's solution to the Nasdaq board in the United States, but it was a failure. Although companies were not required to be profitable, they had to have been in operation for two years with at least HK$20 million cash flow, which Chan said is too high for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many Hong Kong start-ups chose to list in Beijing's new third board which has no cash or operational requirements. If HKEX want to attract these companies to list here, it should only require that they disclose their information to investors and allow market forces to decide if they should raise funds in the market,” Chan said.If it can't even sort out how to reboot the second board, the GEM, can it really do it with a third board?Philip Tsai, chairman, Deloitte China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is also opposed to HKEX following the US or Singapore by introducing the dual share structure for companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The dual share structure is not fair to all investors. It allows founders, even if they do not perform well, to still control the company. This is not fair to majority shareholders,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Philip Tsai, chairman of Deloitte China, said the HKEX should first review the GEM before launching the third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If it can't even sort out how to reboot the second board, the GEM, can it really do it with a third board?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think the HKEX should first review how to improve and position the GEM. It could revamp the GEM for new tech listings, or it can also set up a new market to do so,” Tsai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Roger Chen, vice-president of Asia for domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said the company chose to launch its Flare app - which allows aspiring entrepreneurs to post their ideas and receive feedback from the community - in Hong Kong as its position as an international city with a growing number of start-ups makes it a good test market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We're trying to put Flare into markets where there's already a plentiful start-up ecosystem, and there's a whole bunch of crowd sourcing, accelerators and incubators in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is garnering support towards creating a third board to attract technology start-ups and new economy firms. But safeguards on corporate governance, investor education and transparency in the downside risks are needed to ensure the success of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) has just completed a consultation over the proposed third board, but a second round of consultation on the detailed rules is still needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new third board will offer two markets, one for listing big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, which would open to all investors. The second board is for start-ups which would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main and GEM boards have adopted the one-share one-vote principle in the belief that a dual-class share structure can lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders. Venture capitalists and fund managers also tend to oppose to weighted voting rights as they reduce the price at which they can sell their shares relative to international peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But attitudes of Hong Kong regulators and some market participants are starting to shift, with focus turning to the development of the city's future competitiveness and the appropriate measures to safeguard investors' interests and mitigate governance risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX's proposals strive to address the market quality and risk profile concerns," said Nelson Tang, a partner in the corporate department of </span><span class="s3">Hogan Lovells</span><span class="s1">. "Clearer guidance however from the regulators is needed and a ‘one size fits all' approach should be avoided."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the suggested accelerated delisting regime may allow for quicker enforcement by the stock regulator, which is key to enhancing profitability and corporate governance if listed companies want to maintain their listed status while removing poor performers from the board, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board PRO will restrict access to professional investors only in trading start-ups lacking a financial track record. While this may address concerns that retail investors are perceived to be more vulnerable and less sophisticated, some may argue that a complete ban is an unfair deprivation of an opportunity to invest in these high growth companies. A more flexible approach could be explored by allowing retail investors to participate with additional safeguards in place, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators are also looking at the "primary equity connect" concept, an extended model of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes as an avenue to help with the liquidity of the new and current boards, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marketing and investor education will help make investors savvier when investing in the tech industry, and therefore enhance the appeal for those companies to list in Hong Kong, improving stock liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's proposed third board consultation comes amid the government's promotion on Hong Kong's role in the Lok Ma Chau loop project with Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area integration, which appears to be an effort in developing an innovative culture for education and investment of new economy companies in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Luke Waddington, chief executive of Hong Kong-based fintech Bluepool, says Hong Kong requires a more coherent regulatory framework and bigger government grants to create an innovation technology ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These companies [in Singapore] are on the path towards growing into a large company quickly that eventually aim to IPO. But I don't get the sense that is what has been happening in Hong Kong," Waddington said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He praised Singapore's model as making things much easier for start-ups, citing the ease with which funding can be raised, as well as the ability to exit an investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington added that Singapore has a more coherent regulatory framework designed to get different organisations to come together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore said earlier this year it was seeking public feedback on a suitable regulatory framework to allow the listing of dual-class structures. HKEX invited the public to submit their feedback on the proposed board under a deadline that ended earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore has also announced that it is replicating the UK model, linking the stock regulator with the central bank and businesses so that they can create funding and sandbox mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong has allocated resources to business incubators in Science Park and Cyberport overseen by bureaucrats with little entrepreneurial experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington said a better approach would be to give cash grants directly to entrepreneurs as small companies often struggle to cover the fees to meet licensing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the overall ecosystem can support innovative and new economy companies, then investors will understand why we need a third board and dual-share voting structure," Edward Au, co-leader National Public Offering Group at Deloitte said. "This spirit seems to be starting to develop in Hong Kong now."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As stock exchange officials ponder what might have been, they should bear one fact in mind. Chinese technology firms can raise a lot more money in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In general, tech companies go for a US listing mostly because of valuation," said Jones Ku, chief technology analyst at securities firm Haitong International. "In the past, tech companies got a higher valuation in the US than in the Asian market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a rich pool of seasoned investors and the chance to rank alongside household names like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, the US equity markets have long been popular with international technology firms. Apart from internet portal group Tencent and an earlier, short-lived attempt by Alibaba, Hong Kong has barely featured as a listing destination for mainland technology firms. Observers worry there is little reason this will change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Mok, the legislator representing the information technology functional constituency, said local investors did not understand the sector and the city offered a poor ecosystem for technology firms of all sizes. Local investors were used to making money "in an old-fashioned way" and needed to embrace the new economy, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rubbing salt in the wound, Alibaba's decision to choose New York over Hong Kong coincided with the news that mainland microblogging provider </span><span class="s3">Sina Weibo</span><span class="s1"> wants to raise US$500 million through a US listing. Earlier in the year, Alibaba competitor </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> filed for a US$1.5 billion US IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To reverse this trend, Mok wants to see stock exchange regulators change the listing rules on Hong Kong's secondary exchange, the Growth Enterprise Market board, as a first step to instilling a tech-friendly culture in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Look at the GEM market," he said. "How many years it has lain there doing nothing? They should immediately review all the relevant measures and the effectiveness of the GEM board and find a way with the policy intention of attracting more of these companies to come. These are where the new growth companies are going to be."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM board was founded in 1999 to rival the Nasdaq in the US but its performance has been lacklustre. There were 195 firms listed on the GEM at the end of last year, with a combined market capitalisation of HK$132 billion. That compares with 3,400 companies listed on the Nasdaq, boasting a total market capitalisation of US$6 trillion. Ricky Lai, a research analyst at securities firm </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1">, said listing in the US improved a firm's international reputation. However, he said more Asian investors were chasing technology stocks and Hong Kong could still be an attractive listing destination. He said Alibaba was originally keen to list in the city but pulled out rather than cancel plans for a dual-share structure. "Hong Kong investors know Alibaba's branding and are more willing to invest in this type of stock," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ku said allowing firms with dual-share classes to list on the GEM was one possibility. It was common to see the founders of technology firms create a two-tier share structure to preserve control in a rapidly changing business environment, he said, and that was understood by investors who bought into the firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another idea to help attract fast-growing but income-challenged internet firms would be to relax the rule requiring a three-year profit track record before applying to the more popular main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no real reason for that, given that we don't require companies after listing to maintain their profitability," corporate governance advocate David Webb said. "There shouldn't be a merit-based approach. It should be disclosure based. Let the investor decide whether they want to buy a loss-making company. It may have good reasons for losses."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The obligation to hold an expensive and time-consuming retail offer could also be dropped, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is up for another round of market reform as the stock exchange will solicit views from the public at the end of the month for a new board to allow more technology firms like Alipay and Lufax, as well as foreign giant companies such as </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchange is at the final stage of preparation in the details of this new board. We hope to have the consultation about launching this new board by the end of May,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which runs the stock and futures exchanges in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the sideline of the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> Week Asia forum on Wednesday, Li said they were keen to have a bigger variety of companies to list here, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO that is expected to raise US$100 billion, in a 5 per cent stake sale of the oil giant valued at US$2 trillion. Hong Kong is in the running for the listing, but is facing competition from London and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new market which brokers call the third board, will be the third market in Hong Kong after the Main Board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said in January that the new board would have different listing rules from the other two markets to allow more foreign firms, infrastructure firms, overseas companies on the “Belt and Road Initiative”, technology or new-economy companies, and firms that want to be listed in a dual-class shareholding structure, to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX rekindles plans for dual-class share structure in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2063569/hkex-rekindles-plans-dual-class-share-structure-city]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be a good idea for the HKEX to launch a new board to attract more technology firms to list. Hong Kong has many big banks and financial giants to list, but we have too few technology companies listings here,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector, and is himself a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firms. This would be better than changing the rules for the main board and the GEM,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung however, said the consultation needed to also offer suggestions to safeguard the interests of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We also want the HKEX to have good communication with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, for the regulator to support the reform. We do not want to repeat the chaos two years ago when the stock exchange proposed rule change on dual shareholding structure, and the plan was rejected by the SFC immediately,” he said.A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firmsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many new-economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares with a dual-share structure as their founders tend to hold on to a minority stake but want to retain control. Dual-share structures allow certain shareholders to have more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York over Hong Kong in 2014, as the SFC considers its shareholding structure to be a dual-class shareholding that is banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US. Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called Hong Kong listing rules outdated, that they do not meet the needs of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pain of Alibaba loss prompts HKEX to examine new measures[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2012339/pain-alibaba-loss-prompts-hkex-examine-new-measures]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - payment arm of a unit of Alibaba - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> are both considering to list to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the plan a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time would be different as the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing last month said the commission had agreed to a consultation on the third board, including the dual-class share proposal. The change in attitude was because the type of listings would be limited to the new board, while the previous proposal applied to the entire market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong moves closer to dual-share listings as SFC backs consultation on third board[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2091205/hong-kong-moves-closer-dual-share-listings-sfc-backs-consultation]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, HKEX would face an uphill battle to convince all stakeholders to accept the dual-class shareholding structure. Many fund mangers such as </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> and Templeton Franklin are opposed to it as they consider the structure unfair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be good to have a new market in Hong Kong to attract different types of companies to list here. But as usual, devil is in the details. We need to see if the HKEX proposals are flexible enough to attract new technology companies to list here, while at the same time, that there is sufficient investor protection,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Stockbrokers Association chairman Benny Mau said if the HKEX would propose a third board, it would need to clearly define how the role and listing requirements are different from those for the main board and the GEM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The consultation paper should also consult the market if all investors could invest in this new board or if it should be for institutional investors to trade only,” Mau said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said he supports proposals to launch a new board for start-ups on the stock exchange, as he turns his attention to helping students to carry out research in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, whose 10-year career as a minister comes to an end on Friday, will return to where he came from - </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">. He told the Post he has no title yet but the job would involve research and teaching related to fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government a decade ago, he was dean of business management at the university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I first joined the government, I planned to work for a term of five years only, but eventually I served two terms and have worked for 10 years. It is time to make a change in my career," said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 60, now plans to focus on fintech related research and study in an effort to encourage more youngsters to innovate and develop technologies that will help banks, brokers and insurance companies to do business and provide better services more securely and at a cheaper cost.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes this kind of research will encourage more young people to establish their own start-ups. Chan's move comes at a time when proposals by the stock exchange to establish a new board to help start-ups raise funds are under consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would support the stock exchange in introducing a new board to attract start-ups and dual-share structure companies to list in Hong Kong as long as they could introduce investor protection measures to safeguard the interests of the investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) issued a consultation paper two weeks ago proposing a third board - in addition to the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market - which would have more flexible rules to attract ‘new economy' companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board would offer two markets - one for mega listings of big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, the other for start-ups. Both would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter case, Chan said the reason for this restriction on the type of investor is because "the start-up markets are risky."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the board designed for dual-class structure companies, he said if it allowed retail investors to trade, measures should be put in place to protect the investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding structures are favoured by technology giants such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> as their founders own a minority stake but want to maintain control. They issuance of two classes of shares allows the founders more voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Singapore and some other markets have this sunset clause for the dual-class shares structure to protect the interests of investors," said Chan.Hong Kong is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbiChan Ka-keung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government, Chan had spent his entire career in academia. After winning a scholarship in Hong Kong at the age of 18, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from </span><span class="s3">Wesleyan University</span><span class="s1">, and both his MBA and PhD in finance from the </span><span class="s3">University of Chicago</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He taught for nine years at </span><span class="s3">Ohio State University</span><span class="s1">, before taking up a role at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1"> in 1993, eventually becoming dean of business management. He joined the government as secretary for financial services and the treasury in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back over his past decade as a minister, he is most proud of promoting the yuan business in Hong Kong and overseeing the launch of the two stock connect schemes linking HKEX with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a leading offshore yuan centre. It is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbi. The two stock connects have promoted cross-border trading and enhanced Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission has unveiled key conditions for companies seeking to list in the city with dual-share structures, marking a major step forward in reform of the listing rules designed to help Hong Kong compete with the US in attracting listings by technology firms and other innovative enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conditions have high thresholds as the regulator does not plan to open the door too wide and allow too many companies to apply for such a shareholding structure, because the city does not allow class-action lawsuits to protect shareholders??interests, unlike the United States.The SFC still supports one share, one voteCarlson Tong, SFC chairman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC only wants to allow certain types of newly listed, innovative companies to be eligible for dual-share structures, and only as long as they meet conditions the SFC considers important for shareholder protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said companies applying for dual-share structures would have to be restricted to firms whose founders held only small stakes but whose contributions or innovations were vital to the business, such as in technology firms. Companies with majority shareholders should not be allowed to have such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other conditions designed to ensure investor protection should include sunset provisions, so that the special shareholding structure would end in a certain number of years or when the founders sold their stakes or left the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would support the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) carrying out a second phase of detailed consultation on dual-share structure reform if the exchange could address those issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC still supports one share, one vote,??Tong said. We do not plan to allow all companies to do it. However, we are not turning a deaf ear to market demand to enhance our market to compete with the US for new listings.??/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the first time the SFC had made its position clear on controversial listing reform proposals. HKEx is pushing for reforms to enable Hong Kong to maintain its position as a listing hub for mainland firms after the city lost some heavyweight technology firm listings to the US in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is the city's ultimate market regulator and the HKEx reform proposal would need its approval. Its position appears to clear a major obstacle for the reform, with some market watchers saying it could be introduced in six months to a year. That could help attract many technology firms such as mobile phone maker Xiaomi to list in Hong Kong instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx consulted the market last year on whether it should change listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure which it banned in 1989, after refusing to give Alibaba an exemption from the ban. The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only held a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong. The SFC still believes no exemption should be given but supports rules with clear conditions for companies seeking to apply for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba took its listing to New York, where dual-class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them were information technology companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structures allow one class of shareholder to have more rights than others. Many technology firms??founders sell stakes early on as they seek funding, resulting in them holding small stakes. They argue that dual-share structures protect their interests but many fund managers believe such structures are unfair because they would damage investor protection for small shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's initiative to invest in strategic industries globally is running into difficulties from foreign regulators who are increasing blocking the deals, reflecting the second major blow to outbound investment after Beijing cracked down on the overseas corporate acquisition boom last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's kind of a conundrum," said Howard Zhang, a partner with </span><span class="s3">Davis Polk&amp;Wardwell LLP</span><span class="s1">, acknowledging that this year saw a sharp cooling in outbound mergers and acquisitions, in terms of the number of deals, their value and the range of businesses involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An overseas acquisition bonanza, which saw private Chinese companies snapping up film studios, hotels and sports clubs, suddenly ground to a halt last year after Chinese authorities probed some high-leveraged buyouts by a number of the most acquisitive conglomerates. Beijing later issued new rules that identified investment in property, film and sports as "irrational" and should be "restricted".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the document "encouraged" investment that aligns with the country's strategic interests, such as those along the "Belt and Road" initiative and those helping to boosting technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, private companies have done little to invest in "Belt and Road" countries, while state-owned companies are subject to ever harsher scrutiny in deal involving advanced technology in mature markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's outbound non-financial investment slumped 41.8 per cent to US$68.7 billion in January-August from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Commerce.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump rejected </span><span class="s3">Lattice Semiconductor</span><span class="s1">'s US$1.3 billion sale to a China-backed fund. Lattice had appealed directly to President Trump after the </span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States</span><span class="s1"> (CIFUS) recommended that the sale be blocked. Other Chinese-backed acquisitions of American companies now under review by the committee include the proposed sale of MoneyGram, the payments company, to </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the US CIFUS and public opinion have turned increasingly negative toward Chinese investment, especially in sensitive areas such as semiconductors," said Zhang. "Europe may be more receptive but it presents other challenges, such as antitrust."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From the Chinese companies' perspective, Davis Polk lawyers said it's all about "transparency" and "certainty".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said despite an attractive headline price, foreigners are hesitant to accept Chinese buyers because of execution risk. Among the reasons, Chinese buyers may not get the regulatory approval needed to take funds out of the country, or the deal may run afoul of foreign regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Enforcement against a defaulting Chinese buyer is another problem. As a result, the Chinese buyers may have to pay a premium to win the deal, as well as make a significant upfront deposit to backstop the payment obligations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When they get a US$100 bid from a Chinese company and an European one, they'll hesitate on the Chinese bid because there are so many uncertainties," said Zhang. "If they take the European money they think they know how the buyers' fundraising, regulatory environment and the buyers' corporate governance."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said Chinese don't need to copy western corporate governance standards, but they should strive to make it easier for foreigners to understand their corporate culture. Robust governance, transparency and predictability also matter in post-merger integration.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He Li, a partner with Davis Polk, said Chinese buyers should be more transparent towards acquisition targets and local regulators. They should also flag unique resources they bring to the table. For example, pledging to retaining key employees and customers of the acquisition target can help sway the deal momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the law firm's mainland clients have expressed strong interest in Hong Kong's proposed third board, which would allow the listing of the dual-share structure similar to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that his clients are eager to see the details of how the new board would function, if approved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of Chinese companies with a promising future are hesitating between US and Hong Kong, but they also feel uncertainty abounds. For example, the timetable and whether there will be conditional clauses attached on dual-share structure companies," He said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He, who has participated in many of blockbuster IPOs in Hong Kong market during the past decade, said Hong Kong's proposed third board comes as global stock exchanges are competing with each other to lure good companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To be honest Hong Kong has lost many great opportunities in the past years," He said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared to New York, He said Hong Kong's strength lies in its proximity to where Chinese companies are doing business, relatively lower communication cost and compliance cost.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong's stock market industry watchdog, will not be taking a front-row seat in new listing approvals, meaning the city can now push ahead with plans to launch a new market for dual-class shares in an effort top lure technology companies in particular to list here, according to brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The retreat by the SFC from taking a frontline role in approving new listings means HKEX (</span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">) and the listing committee can continue to share the task," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a local broker who is also the lawmaker representing the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is positive for the HKEX, allowing it to push ahead with another reform later, aimed at attracting more dual-class technology giants to list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class stock structure allows the issuing of various types of shares by a single company, where the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two share classes are typically issued: one share class is offered to the general public, and the other is offered to company founders, executives and family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to sources close to the matter, the SFC and HKEX are now set to unveil what commentators see as a watered-down conclusion to their five-month long consultation, with the SFC agreeing to back off from its desired front-line role in new listings approving, with the HKEX maintaining its primary role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is, however, to be represented on a new committee to formulate listing policies, but would not be able to appraise the performance of HKEX's listing staff, the sources told South China Morning Post on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC's retreat is obviously related to strong opposition from all sectors to its reform plans, with many worried that an upgraded role in approvals would have had a negative affect on the number of new listings," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the SFC now willing to compromise on listing reform, it is likely to be more open minded on allowing dual-class shares companies to list in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's two years since HKEX proposed allowing dual-class share listing in Hong Kong, which the SFC immediately opposed, fearing such a structure would be unfair to investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shares are still not allowed in Hong Kong, but the US does allow them, a factor which is largely credited with mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's opting for Wall Street instead of Hong Kong to list in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global equity strategist Christopher Wood said rejecting duel-listing in Hong Kong would be "stupid" and lead to lost future listing opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the key in future will be disclosure, and that as long as the dual-class shares companies were open about their shareholder structure, it would be up to investors to decide if they want to buy or walk away from an investment.The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpracticeJoseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed a two-month consultation into the launch of a new third board to allow dual-class share structure companies, and make it easier for start-ups to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform is expected to need a second consultation later this year. If it again gains strong support, the new board could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, however, maintains that dual-class shares could still be allowed to list on the main board instead of being forced to choose the new board. But he would not oppose market participants wanting to list on a new board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, believes the SFC will continue to use enforcement action to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpractice, if needed."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mike Wong Ming-wai, chief executive of the Chamber of Listed Companies of Hong Kong, said he was glad the SFC had retreated from its proposed plan to become directly involved in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We still worry, however, there may be over-regulation in the market if the SFC goes ahead with its proposal to set up a new committee involving its representatives in setting listing policies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC may still have an important influence on this committee and hence a tight curb on the new listing policies. We want to see Hong Kong remain a market that has listing rules friendly to all market players, instead of one which is regulatory led."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock exchange will face mounting competition from Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, as speedier listing approval process and strong demand from investors expected next year will help them to extend their top rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its annual IPO review and outlook for 2018, EY laid out the prediction based on the number of IPOs and proceeds raised this year - 436 companies mopped up 230.4 billion yuan (US$35.1 billion) from the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These represent an increase of 92 per cent in number and 53 per cent in proceeds compared to 2016, and make the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges the top two respectively in number of IPOs completed this year. Hong Kong was ranked third, with a total of 160 IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in terms of proceeds raised, the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> ranked top in 2017, with US$39.5 billion, followed by Shanghai at US$20.9 billion; and Hong Kong at US$16.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the number of A-share IPOs reached a record high, a lack of IPO that raised over 5 billion yuan per deal also means that all these IPOs' proceeds raised combined was just 47 per cent the total amount raised in 2010, which was the second biggest year for IPOs in numbers at 347.There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listedRingo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, “there were 508 companies [as of December 22] waiting in the pipeline to have their IPOs approved by the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">,” said Ringo Choi, IPO leader for Asia-Pacific at EY. “There is still good demand from mainland investors for IPOs and so long as the Chinese stock markets do not collapse [in 2018], we believe this pipeline can get listed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi said the A-share IPO market became more “normalised” as 2017 progressed, with an average of 30-40 IPOs completed per month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, a record 160 IPOs were completed, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Combined they raised HK$128.2 billion (US$16.5 billion), down however by 34 per cent from a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to EY, a lack of large IPOs also squeezed total funds raised in Hong Kong. But more significantly, a record 80 companies got listed on GEM board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bullish performance of the Hang Seng Index, which has gained 34 per cent this year and ranked first among major indices including </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Dow Jones Industrial Average, has benefited the IPO market, Choi said, adding that 28 overseas companies were also attracted to list in Hong Kong, the highest in six years, raising a total of HK$10.02 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“New listing rules to be introduced in 2018 for allowing listing of dual-class share structure on the main board; and the proposal to increase the minimum expected market capitalisation of main board applicants to HK$500 million from HK$200 million are all positive for the Hong Kong IPO market for the first half,” Choi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, for the second half he was more cautious. Apart from uncertainty about whether investors would still continue to favour equities like they did in 2017, Choi noted competition from the two exchanges in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expected that as A-share IPO vetting process accelerates with simpler approval procedures, this might erode the attraction of the Hong Kong bourse as these companies might opt for a listing on the mainland because of the attractive pricing levels that can be achieved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For 2018, he expects IPOs in Hong Kong to raise HK$150 billion, but a mega IPO, such as that by listing hopeful Saudi Arabia's national oil giant Aramco, will bring the total to over HK$200 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the SFC, say they will work together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for new economy companies, adding momentum to the proposed new stock market for dual class shares after regulators embraced a water down version of listing reforms on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform should not be seen as a power struggle between the SFC and HKEX. The two regulators and the government all want to work together to upgrade the quality of Hong Kong markets and to see that the market operates more efficiently,” said James Lau, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the listing reform package, the Securities and Futures Commission agreed to abandon its controversial proposal last year for a frontline role in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central listing approval process will remain in the hands of HKEX and its listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC also agreed to abandon a proposal to review the performance of listing division staff. The responsibility will instead remain part of the purview of HKEX executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not a climb down which is a wrong way to describe the conclusion. We are listening to comments and consider the current approach more effective,” said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The conclusion will clarify the roles of SFC and HKEX in vetting new listings. Many problems happen after companies get listed. This is why post-listing enforcement is important,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will retain its role in setting listing policies, while a 12 member advisory panel will support the listing committee in setting policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government and the SFC and the stock exchange are open minded to carefully study how to carry out reforms to make sure our market could attract new economies to list here while at the same time we protect the interest of investors,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The water downed listing reforms come after a five-month controversial consultation last year, which received 8,500 submissions from brokers, listed companies and financial professionals. Ninety-four per cent of respondents were against the proposed reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said the listing reform result was a blow to the SFC and a victory for the HKEX and would likely help pave way for the launch of a third board supporting dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 the HKEX pushed for a consultation process on whether to launch dual class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX completed a two month consultation on the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board was among the top agenda items at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in August, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are listed in the US under a dual class share structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong needs to launch a new board for mainland Chinese technology companies and start-ups which would have more flexible listing rules such as dual share structures which have stoked controversy in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, known as the "Father of Red Chips" and the newly elected chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said these companies should not be listed on the main board of the stock exchange but on a separate board or a revamped Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong will need to launch more different boards for different types of companies to raise funds. The listing entry requirements of the Hong Kong main board or the GEM are too high and too restrictive for them," Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This has driven these companies to go to list in the US. So far, only Tencent is listing in Hong Kong while other big players such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> have listed in the US for the better valuations and more flexible listing rules. Without any reforms, Hong Kong is losing out in the international markets as these new technology companies are playing such an important role in the new economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as e-commerce giant Alibaba prefer dual-share structures that allow their founders or key executives to have more rights than other shareholders, which are allowed in the US but have been banned in Hong Kong since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> last month said it planned to have a formal consultation in the third quarter on a rule change to allow a dual share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But market regulator Securities and Futures Commission came out within days to publicly oppose the suggestion due to insufficient investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said in an interview with the Post that he urged the bourse to rethink a rule change as many US listed mainland technology firms have decided to delist to prepare for a re-listing in markets here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung demurred. "Many of these mainland technology companies are planing to return to list in the A-shares market in Shanghai or Shenzhen, instead of Hong Kong. This further showed we are losing our competitiveness," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Mainland China now has the ChiNext and Third Board for newly set up companies to raise funds, while Shanghai is preparing a new board with a similar purpose. Hong Kong so far has done nothing to capture these companies to list here. There has been no response to Premier Li Kiqiang's call for more support for start-ups," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also opposed to an SFC proposal for fund managers to intervene in the management of listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC last month has just ended a three-month consultation for fund managers and institutional investors to exercise responsible ownership by requiring them to meet with executives of listed companies they invest in from time to time and to give suggestions on how to run their businesses. Fund managers who do not do so would need to explain why.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The fund managers should let the management of listed companies decide on how to run their business. The SFC proposal would only create more problems than help improve the quality of the market," said Leung.</span></p>

We are not ruling out similar linkages with the </span><span class="s3">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> or futures exchanges across the border," HKEx chairman Chow Chung-kong said after the annual general meeting of the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and mainland regulators last week announced a through-train scheme to begin in October that will allow investors from the city and the mainland to cross-trade stocks listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong up to a quota of 550 billion yuan (HK$691 billion). The quota has no time frame and Beijing has not said if it will replenish the quota after it runs out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx and the Shanghai exchange will soon sign the agreement. Under it, mainland investors looking to trade Hong Kong stocks can do so through mainland brokers, who will place the orders at the Shanghai exchange that will then be passed on to the HKEx. Those in Hong Kong investing in mainland stocks will do the reverse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors can trade up to 10.5 billion yuan of Hong Kong stocks a day, or 250 billion yuan in total, while Hong Kong investors can trade up to 13 billion yuan of Shanghai stocks a day, up to 300 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the HKEx annual general meeting yesterday, some small shareholders asked about the possibility of listing reforms after the exchange lost e-commerce giant Alibaba's initial public offering to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to look for another listing venue after it failed to convince the Securities and Futures Commission and the exchange in October to allow it to list with a share structure that would give its founders and the top management more control of the board despite holding minorities stakes. The US allows such dual-class share structures but Hong Kong does not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's listing committee is studying the issue while HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wrote in his blog about the need to take a fresh look at the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But institutional investors are opposed to any changes in existing rules. A survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association on Tuesday showed most are against any changes to the listing rules and want the one-share-one-vote principle to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before we make any changes to our rules, we would need to have a consultation to gauge the market view," Chow said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lead-up to the five-yearly Communist Party congress on October 18[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2109388/reading-between-lines-what-watch-chinas-most-important] is a sensitive period in Chinese politics. Important policy decisions and documents issued at this time are weighed for their significance. Guidelines calling for more support for China's entrepreneurs are no exception and are part of the first such directive to safeguard the country's private business owners since the party took power in 1949.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing tries to win over entrepreneurs with praise and promises[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2112923/beijing-tries-win-over-entrepreneurs-praise-and-promises]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is not hard to find reasons why the Central Committee and the State Council would laud the contribution of businesspeople to China's rise, highlight the role entrepreneurs have to play in structural economic reform and sustainable development, and promise to protect them. They are to be found in a slowing contribution to domestic investment growth from the private sector, as capital outflows from the country continued. In the first eight months state sector investment grew by 11.2 per cent, while private investment slowed to 6.4 from 6.9 per cent January to July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given that the private sector contributes more than 60 per cent of China's gross domestic product and provides 80 per cent of its jobs, this imbalance cannot continue. Government-led investment is not a sustainable growth driver for the mainland economy. The guidelines are therefore seen as a response to calls for further reforms ahead of the party congress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coming from the Central Committee and the State Council, they represent a high-level consensus rather than the views of a state leader. They also confound criticism that President Xi Jinping is leading China back to the era of Mao Zedong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A loss of confidence and reluctance to invest, or invest at home, are attributed to intrusive state intervention in business and investment activities and the lack of rule of law to protect private assets. Many businesspeople are trying to move wealth out of China amid a deteriorating business environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next generation poised to take over China's biggest private firms[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2113180/china-cusp-unprecedented-transfer-wealth-new-generation-takes]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is hardly positive for more private investment in innovative and hi-tech industries in line with the policies of Xi. The crackdown on tycoons buying highly leveraged overseas assets has raised more questions about policy direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recent announcement of a mixed state and private share structure for some state-owned enterprises signals greater recognition of the private sector. The promises in the new guidelines to protect entrepreneurs' legitimate rights and interests, ensure fair market competition and strengthen protection of intellectual property rights are welcome.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We need to see more policies to encourage investment, improve the business environment and protect assets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the Hong Kong stock exchange rued the one that got away, praise for honouring a principle was cold comfort for the loss of what remains the world's biggest techinitial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We are referring of course to the US$25 billion listing of Alibaba on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If this city's regulators had been prepared to relax its one-share, one-vote rule to enable the company's founders to retain board control, it would have been a different story.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the heavy cost, this newspaper said it was the right decision not to bend the rule for Alibaba, which now owns thePost, but that did not mean the long-standing principle itself should not be reviewed and changed, as opposed to bent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has taken more than three years of soul-searching amid division among both regulators and officials, but the decision to amend the listing rules to allow a two-tiered share structure has borne quick fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong looks set to score its first major coup in attracting new technology listings, with mainland smartphone giant Xiaomi[http://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] having briefed investment banks to work on a share salein Hong Kongrather than New York that could raise as much as US$16.5 billion, which would be the biggest listing in the city sincethe US$20.4 billion initial public offering by AIA in 2010.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lot has changed since Hong Kong paid a heavy price for refusing to abandon a fundamental principle. At that time in Asia there was limited acceptance of dual share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now Singapore is amending its rules and targeting Chinese tech companies, Shanghai is starting to catch up with Hong Kong and New York paved the way long ago. It is hard for Hong Kong to go against the trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is, after all, very important to attract tech companies if the city wants to become a financial hub for China and also a hi-tech centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the future the Chinese economy is increasingly going to be driven by tech companies such as Xiaomi and others. Whether it can attract these listings iscritical to the city's future and positioning as a financial hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the growth of internet companies public sentiment towards them and confidence has improved. Making tech companies more welcome here is a way of encouraging our own start-ups.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HK revamps listing rules in battle for global tech giants -- SCMP headline, December 16</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This latest attempt by Hong Kong's stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to destroy shareholder democracy has an offhand way of dismissing his earlier, overly ambitious attempt to do away with all significant listing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That earlier concept paper in 2015 was only a “straw man”, says this latest concept paper; meaning, I take it, that it was an intentionally false proposal we were meant to knock down, so as to make it easier to introduce the real one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oh, thank you, Charles. So kind of you to waste our time. How very thoughtful of you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the real one (let's hope it's not just another straw man this time) does have one brand new idea: it is to allow listing by “pre-revenue” biotech companies, as long as they have a “minimum expected market capitalisation” of HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I shall ask the obvious question for you: If they are not yet selling anything, leave alone turning any profit, on what basis can the market be “expected” to value them?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Perhaps we could try the old Roman way of dealing with such eventualities. Take a live chicken, cut it open on the spot and then call in a soothsayer to tell you what the entrails forecast. It worked for the Romans apparently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new concept paper's version of this idea is to say there “tends to be” strict regulation of activities undertaken by biotech companies, and this should be enough. If it's good enough to swallow, then it's worth at least HK$1.5 billion, you see.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We had an example of such tends-to-be strict regulation only last week, when a doctor at a beauty shop was convicted of manslaughter by administering untested biotech quack remedies. It's a big industry. Just look at its tsunami of advertisements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Let's face it. This town has a weakness for biobabble. Talk a fast line in biotech and the customers will always line up. No one understands a word of it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then we get Charles back to his one-track mindset of WVR, or weighted voting rights. Our principle of “One Share, One Vote” is to be abandoned for “new economy” companies. All shareholders are equal, but some will be more equal than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong can now join the international race for the bottom in listing standards, while the cash-out price of Charles' share options - remember that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd</span><span class="s1"> is a listed company, whose shares are trading near a record - can race for the top.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But I mustn't spread falsehoods. It is not true that ordinary shareholders will be deprived of all voting rights in WVR companies. As long as their votes don't matter, they can have a few. Maybe they can butter them and have them for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And again, of course, we get no definition of what the “new economy” is. It is “hard to define”, “not necessarily restricted to specific sectors”, “likely to evolve over time” and “the Exchange proposes to publish a guidance letter”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any investment banker can find his way round such non-restrictions. WVR will therefore apply to the entire market from now on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The oddity here is that recent events have made nonsense of the supposed purpose of attracting more technology listings. They have come anyway. There has been a flood of them over the last few months, as high tech, and devoid of earnings, as any mindless follower of investment fashion could want.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also worth noting that WVR does not really make a stock more attractive to the professionals. In the US, for instance, both the S&amp;P and the MSCI indices have recently announced they will not accept shares with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This matters. The MSCI indices in particular are benchmarks for institutional investors. To have your stock included in any of them is to attract big time investor interest. To be permanently excluded because of your share structure now constitutes a self-induced banishment to second class.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So why do it?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There must be some legitimate reason. I cannot imagine that every corporate chieftain who asks for a WVR listing does it only because he wants to have his cake and eat it too, and is happy to rob his shareholders in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As I say, there must be a defensible reason. But don't ask me what it is.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New economy companies seeking to list dual-class shares in Hong Kong could be eligible to apply by the end of June, according to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-stock-exchange] (HKEx) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a listing reform plan announced last month, HKEx will allow biotech firms without revenue and other large new economy companies with dual-class shares to list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said a six- to eight-week consultation on the rule change will begin in February after the Lunar New Year[https://www.scmp.com/topics/lunar-new-year] holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If all goes well, we hope all the rule changes would be ready in early June and we can start to accept applications for listing from new economy and biotech companies,” Li said on the sidelines of the Asian Financial Forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shareholding structure had been prohibited in Hong Kong since the mid-1980s. These share structures are favoured by technology companies such as Facebook[https://www.scmp.com/topics/facebook] or Alphabet as they enable founders to maintain control of the company even though they only hold a minority of the listed shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ban on the dual-share structure is believed to be one of the main reasons why the city lost out when mainland Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for New York in its record US$25 billion IPO in 2014[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1599023/alibaba-ipo-size-boosted-after-it-took-walk].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to identify which companies have contacted the exchange since the proposed rule change, although mainland handset maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] is rumoured to be among the candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said he also welcomed US-listed new economy companies seeking a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the HKEx proposal unveiled in December, “innovative” Chinese companies with a market capitalisation of more than HK$10 billion (US$1.27 billion) will be eligible to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong as long as they have a primary on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, or </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba, Baidu[https://www.scmp.com/topics/baidu], and JD.com[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jd] are all very large Chinese new economy companies listed in the US,” Li said. “Our reform would allow these companies to list here. I cannot say if an individual company would decide to list in Hong Kong, but we can have a regulatory framework ready for them to consider to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] executive chairman Jack Ma Yun[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] last week said he would consider listing in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange] upon a request by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[https://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said he hoped an ETF connect and a derivate connect would launch this year, but cautioned that more progress on technical issues was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that the existing stock connect scheme had helped to pump up daily market turnover. In the first three weeks of the year turnover has risen to HK$130 billion, compared to HK$88.25 billion in 2017 and HK$66.92 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's equity market notched up its biggest year for fundraising since 2010, with companies netting US$65.7 billion, an increase of 41.2 per cent on last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not far behind, the market for yuan-denominated, or dim sum, bonds reached US$53.6 billion, a year-on-year growth of 76.3 per cent, driven by mainland financial institutions as they raised capital for offshore operations. The majority of those deals were based in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several large mainland initial public offerings pushed the city's IPO market into the No 2 rank globally, between the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq Stock Market</span><span class="s1">. Companies raised US$29.3 billion in the city this year, 80 per cent of which came from mainland-based firms, Thomson Reuters data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties</span><span class="s1"> raised US$3.7 billion this month in Asia's biggest float of the year. </span><span class="s3">CGN Power</span><span class="s1"> came in a close second, selling US$3.6 billion of shares on December 3.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, many brokers dwelt on what they did not get, namely the record-breaking </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> float.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We lost a big fish this year," said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, a director at </span><span class="s3">VC Brokerage</span><span class="s1">. "That was kind of a misfortune."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost the biggest-ever flotation after Alibaba chose to launch its US$25 billion public offering in New York. The Hangzhou-based e-commerce giant clashed with local regulators over its share structure and opted for the New York market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The value of equity deals this year was still far below that of 2010, when companies issued US$109.4 billion in shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overall, investors did not show a strong appetite for giant mainland listings. The case of </span><span class="s3">WH Group</span><span class="s1"> highlighted that sentiment in April when the world's largest pork-product producer first slashed its proposed offering from more than US$5 billion to US$1.9 billion before altogether pulling the sale due to weak demand. It relaunched the offering in July, raising US$2.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Performance divergence is a surprise," Matthew Kwok, the chief strategist at China Yinsheng Wealth Management, said of the disappointing debuts of some of the biggest listings. "Maybe it was because investors have preferred the secondary market and haven't trusted these huge IPOs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda</span><span class="s1"> fell 2.6 per cent below its offering price of HK$48 on the first day of trading. </span><span class="s3">CGN Power</span><span class="s1">, on the other hand, surged 19 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insiders are cautious on the outlook for the IPO market next year. The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> in October announced an end to its bond-buying programme and an increase in interest rates starting next year. That move will sap liquidity from global markets, the same cheap money that helped fire investment in Hong Kong equities this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's not only Hong Kong that will feel the impact," Tse said. "But without [quantitative easing], fund managers will be more selective on IPOs here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major share issuances from listed state-run mainland firms helped fuel the equities market this year. Follow-on equities issuances totalled US$33.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland firms also looked to dim sum bonds, which have taken an increasing share of offshore capital raising since the instrument was launched in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The majority came from mainland banks and securities houses that are trying to establish offshore operations," said Crystal Zhao, a fixed-income researcher at </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the biggest such deal of the year, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> issued US$653.8 million worth of investment-grade dim sum bonds in March. Six of the 10 biggest deals were issued by major mainland banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> estimates the dim sum bond market will grow up to 53 per cent next year to 490 billion yuan (HK$612.5 billion) to 520 billion yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">London's multiple-market structure enables companies ranging from innovative start-ups to mature, established firms to raise funds, according to London Stock Exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined to comment on whether listing reforms in Hong Kong - which might include introducing additional boards with different listing requirements - could help attract more e-commerce and technology companies to list their shares there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he did say that in his experience it was advantageous to offer several different markets catering for a broader range of prospective companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I can only share our experience that shows it would be better to have different markets to meet the different needs of companies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> agrees with the Hong Kong stock exchange principle of "one share, one vote", which prevents companies with a dual-class structure from floating their shares, because it is fair to investors, said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he said he understands why some e-commerce founders might be against it because they want to maintain control of their company despite holding a minority stake. In a dual-share listing, the stocks carry unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> allows firms with this dual-share structure to list on its High Growth Market, which is in between the AIM, the standard market and premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The four markets have different [listing] requirements and can meet the needs of different types of companies," said Rolet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is currently consulting the market on listing reforms which propose to set up two separate committees - a listing policy committee to set policies and a listing regulatory committee to approve complicated listing applications. The latest consultation period ends this Friday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Calls for reform came after e-commerce giant Alibaba chose New York over Hong Kong for its US$25 billion IPO two years ago because the former allows dual-share listings. The structure has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s because it is seen as breaching the long-held "one share, one vote" principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators refused Alibaba's request for exemption from the rule, which would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate a majority of the board. Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma earlier this month criticised the Hong Kong listing rule, saying it is outdated and cannot match the needs of a modern economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rolet said the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is aware of many start-ups and private companies that want to raise funds but are not yet qualified to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has thus set up a programme called ELITE which allows such companies to undergo 18 months of support and mentorship to prepare them for a listing. Senior executives participate in a number of workshops aimed at helping them review and change their business model.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When they are ready, the companies can try to raise funds through investors or apply to list on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have had 450 companies in 27 countries in Europe, America and Africa [on the programme]," said Rolet. "We are considering bringing it to Asia where there are many high growth companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our youngest participant company in the ELITE programme is just seven months old, and the oldest one is a 700-year old wine making company. Some are start-ups while some of them are family-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no guarantee that these companies will succeed and some of them may collapse. But on average, these companies go on to have an annual growth rate of 60 per cent."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) is working closely with both Hong Kong and mainland regulators on further moves to try to connect mainland and foreign investors with each other, Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, told an audience at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Securities Institute</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companies,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to his plans, HKEX is considering the creation of what's being dubbed “Primary Connect” - a programme which would allow mainlanders to subscribe for new shares listing in Hong Kong, which in turn will hopefully attract more international firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He refused to give any further details or a timetable on this latest “Connect” initiative, and declined to confirm if those international companies already listed in New York or London, would be able to make secondary listings or secondary share placements via the proposed plan.Hong Kong needs more international companies to list here and mainland investors also like to use the Hong Kong market to invest in international companiesCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange already has two “Stock Connects” in place with their counterparts in Shanghai and Shenzhen, allowed cross trading of shares between the exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also kicked off its “Bond Connect” programme in July which allows mainland Chinese bonds to be traded by international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This [new plan] still needs a lot of parties to discuss the details. What I can say is this new Primary Connect will benefit both the Hong Kong and mainland markets,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li and HKEX have already prioritised their desire to increase the number of major international players listing in Hong Kong, as well as helping more mainlanders to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major exchanges around the world, including Hong Kong, are licking their lips especially, over the prospects of hosting the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of energy giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, expected to be the largest IPO ever when it floats in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market is the third largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation but it is dominated by mainland companies, which take up 60 per cent of its total value with the rest predominantly Hong Kong companies, and a few international listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, say they are working flatout together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for foreign firms, especially new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed the consultation for a plan to launch a new board, referred to as the “third board”, for dual class shares companies or those newly start-ups without profit to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe for Hong Kong to be a serious contender to land the Aramco IPO, or any other major multinational IPO for that matter, regulators would need to design the planned Primary Connect in a way to allow foreign listed firms to have secondary listings or placements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also needs more diversify in its mix of constituent company listings, argue brokers, illustrated well with the fact that 56 per cent of the funds raised in the first half were by financial firms, and less than one per cent from new economy or technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The comments we have received so far show there is a consensus that Hong Kong cannot afford to miss any opportunities to act as a fundraising hub for new economy firms,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said it would still need a second round of consultation on the details of the new third board before it could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board is proposed to contain two markets - one is for big companies with dual share structure for all investors to trade and another is for start-ups for professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many commentators consider the planned start-up market is a risky tactic, while others think dual-class share companies should be more encouraged to list on the main board, rather than the planned new one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said the bourse could also opt for what he termed a “landing zone” approach to make some change to the proposal regarding the third board plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, the offshore arm of China's biggest brokerage, is planning to accelerate its expansion in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other areas that are part of the Beijing's ambitious “Belt and Road Initiative”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong-based brokerage, founded in 1986 and acquired by state-owned </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> five years ago, has re-entered Pakistan through a partnership with Alfalah Securities. It also intends to establish a presence in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Dubai this year through similar partnerships with local firms in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past 32 years, CLSA has established a presence in 13 markets in Asia, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Korea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As China expands, we are also expanding globally,” said Jonathan Slone, CEO of CLSA, in an interview in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asia is our backyard. [But] we want to be in all areas of the ‘Belt and Road Initiative'.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China launched its flagship global trade strategy five years ago, aiming to create an economic land belt that includes countries on the ancient Silk Road through central and west Asia, the Middle East and Europe, as well as a maritime route that links China's port facilities with the African coast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is estimated that Beijing has pumped several hundred billions of US dollars into building infrastructure projects across more than 70 countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, Chinese companies, mostly state-owned, have secured US$500 billion of construction contracts along the belt and road's route in the past five years. Funding for the projects mostly comes from state lenders or financial groups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone said because of the firm's relationship with </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">, which is controlled by China's </span><span class="s3">Citic Group</span><span class="s1">, CLSA has advantages in facilitating cross-border funding and carrying out capital market work for Chinese companies to expand overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being owned by a strong parent has put us in a unique position, into and out of China,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone hopes to leverage the parent's deep connections in China and CLSA's own extensive Asia network and global distribution, to play a more central role in helping Chinese companies go global and bringing international capital to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said CLSA's investment banking business has grown sharply, with the help of </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">. The firm has completed 17 initial public offerings so far this year and has an “enviable pipeline”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to the connections of its parent in China, CLSA has won work on a number of high-profile Chinese tech and internet IPOs in the Hong Kong market. It recently advised Xiaomi, the first company with a dual-class share structure to list in Hong Kong, and Beigene, the first Nasdaq-listed firm to seek a dual listing under Hong Kong's new rules to attract biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone also expects the firm's private equity business to expand, as he sees increasing demand from technology companies to raise capital from the private market. The firm currently has US$4 billion of assets under management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA kicks off its 25th investor forum on Monday in Hong Kong, an annual gathering of international investors, companies, and industry leaders to discuss political and economic conditions as well as future trends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Slone said for the first time, nearly half of the companies attending the forum this year are Chinese firms, which may be coming to tap public and private capital or new markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> may postpone its potential HK$100 billion listing plan to 2015 if the mainland's top e-commerce firm cannot get a deal done in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A delay would be linked to the terms of a deal struck last year with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, giving Alibaba the right to buy back half the 24 per cent stake the United States internet company holds in the mainland firm by the end of 2015, investment bankers told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Failure to list before December 31, 2015, would force Alibaba back to the negotiating table to agree new terms, bankers said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun and his long-time friend and executive vice-chairman, Joe Tsai, have persuaded the company's top management that an initial public offering should not be rushed, despite a determined push in recent weeks to set the listing wheels in motion, sources familiar with the discussions told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's not about money. In fact, Alibaba isn't short of cash. Jack Ma cares more about retaining control of the company than how much money he can raise from the IPO," a banker with knowledge of the situation said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsai, who is considered Ma's closest adviser, told several bankers recently that a listing this year was not a must for Alibaba and that the company had other priorities including making overseas acquisitions, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and might have only a matter of weeks left before the same happened in Hong Kong, the Post reported on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Delaying to next year could put a big dent into the potential HK$100 billion analysts estimate Alibaba could raise if the deal comes to market this year, given the pent-up demand among fund managers after a lack of major new offerings this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Alibaba joins the swelling pipeline of deals for early next year, it risks coming to market as an expected increase in global interest rates fuelled by an anticipated scaling back of the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme jolts stock market valuations, money managers say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for Alibaba yesterday reiterated that the company had no specific timetable for an initial public offering, had not appointed underwriters, and had not selected a listing venue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has run into regulatory trouble in Hong Kong over Ma's determination to keep management control of the firm he founded in Hangzhou in 1999, despite having only a 7.4 per cent stake. The top management team combined own about 10 per cent of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beside's </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">'s 24 per cent holding, Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> has a 36.7 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Talks with Hong Kong regulators have been stalled by a stand-off over the firm's desire to retain a partnership structure that the authorities fear could give too much voting power to company executives at the expense of ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival Nasdaq are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed and in particular popular among technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government yesterday came out in support of the Securities and Futures Commission's stance in the controversy over Alibaba's listing plans and rejected calls to strip the stock exchange of its power to approve listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock exchange has no plans to consult the market about any change in listing rules. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine," Chan Ka-keung, the secretary for financial services and the treasury, said at a Legislative Council meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the law, the chief executive can issue directives to the SFC, meaning the government has the final say on any listing issue, but it has never exercised this power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant lobbied the SFC and the stock exchange last month to be allowed to have a partnership structure that would have let its top executives nominate the majority of board members. The regulators refused to budge, saying there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another. Alibaba has since reportedly been looking at listing in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Legislator Charles Mok, who represents the information technology sector, asked the government if new policies were being considered to attract technology firms to list in the city. The Hong Kong listing approval structure and listing rules work fine CHAN KA-KEUNG</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In an attack on regulators following the rebuff, Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai said last month: "Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes" and "look forward as the rest of the world passes it by".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan rejected allegations that Hong Kong was lagging behind and said that a number of "high quality" technology firms had listed in the city. "Hong Kong is not the only market worldwide to ban dual-class share structures … Most markets ban such structures," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US is the only market that allows the dual-class share structure. The US regulator, the SEC, in the 1980s appealed to the courts to ban such structures. The court ruled the issue would have to be determined by state law. The US has a different system from Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the legislator representing the financial services sector, asked Chan to consider stripping </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> of its power to approve listings, saying there was a conflict of interest between its obligation to shareholders and its role as a regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have seen many mainland companies facing problems shortly after listing here. The government should consider taking away the HKEx's regulatory role," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said that was unnecessary because the SFC had been monitoring the exchange's approval of listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the stock exchange had officially said "no" to Alibaba's proposal, Cheung said there was concern that it had worked with Alibaba behind the scenes to find a way out of the impasse before it had finally agreed to the SFC's stance against any relaxation of the rules.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower, the world's biggest operator of mobile phone towers, will launch its share sale offer to raise between US$8 billion and US$10 billion next Wednesday, making it the world's biggest initial public offering so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based company, which was formed in 2014 through the merger of the transmission operations of </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Unicom</span><span class="s1"> (Hong Kong) and </span><span class="s3">China Telecom</span><span class="s1">, will launch investor road shows on Monday and its IPO will begin on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the plan.The retail market response may not be strong due to a combination of factorsAlex Wong, director of asset management, Ample Capital</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The initial target for China Tower is to raise US$10 billion, but the fundraising size could be smaller. Everything is not definitive given the current market uncertainties,” said another source, adding that the company has been closely watching market sentiment and that changes could be made depending on the response from investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International Financing Review reported on Wednesday the mobile phone infrastructure company was planning to raise up to about US$8.8 billion at a valuation of up to US$35 billion, citing people close to the deal. The addition of a standard green shoe option of 15 per cent of the base deal size will bring the proceeds to about US$10 billion, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offering will place China Tower ahead of Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, as the world's biggest IPO this year. Xiaomi raised US$5.4 billion through its listing after the green shoe option was exercised. China Tower's IPO will also be the fourth-largest flotation in Hong Kong in three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post , still holds the world record for IPO size with its US$25 billion New York float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some fund managers were a little doubtful about the response to China Tower's listing in the current market environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital, said the IPO came at a time when liquidity is tight in the Chinese market and interest rates are relatively high, adding to the debt burden of the tower operations company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The retail market response may not be strong due to a combination of factors, including the unfavourable macro environment, the weakening Chinese yuan and the simple and not so sexy growth story about China Tower itself, as the majority of its revenue is from rental business of telecoms towers,” said Wong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added: “The company generates revenue in yuan, but the IPO is in the Hong Kong market. The expected investment returns of investors will also be subject to changes in the exchange rate between the yuan and the US dollar.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower, in which </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1"> holds a 38 per cent stake, reported 1.9 billion yuan and 76 million yuan in profit, respectively, for 2017 and 2016. In 2015, it suffered a loss of 3.6 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its revenue reached 68.7 billion yuan by the end of 2017, more than 97 per cent of which came from its tower business. It relies heavily on its three biggest clients - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Telecom</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Unicom</span><span class="s1">. These companies contributed towards 99.8 per cent of China Tower's revenue last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower had liabilities of borrowings worth 144.6 billion at the end of March 2018, with current liabilities worth 96.4 billion yuan and non-current liabilities worth 48.2 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors' response to the IPO may still be “OK”, depending on how China Tower values itself in the end, said Wong. “I think the only concern for them is the IPO pricing, and the response largely depends on whether it's attractive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan rate hit a fresh one-year low on Thursday against the greenback. Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said she expected more yuan weakness going forward, reflecting a more explicit policy decision from the Chinese authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China Tower flotation will also boost Hong Kong's status in its race to retake the global IPO crown. Thanks to Xiaomi, it has edged up to No. 2 from No. 5 globally in terms of fundraising size so far this year, behind only the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, according to </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi priced its IPO at HK$17, the low end of its indicative range of HK$17 to HK$22. Its shares have, however, swung wildly since their debut, affected by overall market volatility and a weekend announcement by mainland stock exchanges, which put a temporary halt on accepting Xiaomi into the pool of eligible shares for mainland investors to trade through the stock trading links between Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange announced on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with its mainland counterparts to discuss the possibility of adding companies with weighted voting rights shares to the trading links, triggering a rebound in Xiaomi stock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said China Tower, which does not opt for a weighted voting rights share structure, will not be affected by the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong's securities regulator</span><span class="s1"> and stock exchange have overhauled the city's listing regulations, allowing companies with weighted voting rights share structures - multiple classes of shares whereby founders exert an outsized control even with minority ownership - to list in the city.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) is working flat out to attract more international firms, especially so-called new-economy companies, to list in the city to enhance the competitiveness of the local market, according to chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Over 60 per cent of listed companies on the Hong Kong stock market are mainland firms. Mainland investors clearly like to invest in our stocks but they would like to invest in more international stocks too, which are not available in the mainland," Li told a packed public forum on the soon-to-be launched Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect share trading link, on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we also want to attract more mainland investors into the Hong Kong stock market via the stock connect scheme between Hong Kong and Shanghai, we need to offer more international stocks for them to buy and attract more international firms or exchange traded funds to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched in November 2014 so international investors could buy A-shares in Shanghai via Hong Kong stock brokers, while mainlanders can invest in Hong Kong stocks via mainland brokers, under a daily quota.All we need now is the starting gun [for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect], but that's not in my handsCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new link between Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock markets was approved by the State Council in August, but Beijing is yet to announce a launch date, although Li did reveal last month the new scheme would be launched on a Monday after mid November, which suggests November 21 or 28.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock exchanges and brokers in Hong Kong and Shenzhen have all prepared well for the launch of the new cross-border trading scheme. All we need now is the starting gun, but that's not in my hands," said Li, indicating all parties concerned are waiting for the green light from Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li told the forum that the new connect scheme would likely operate for at least a decade, and by then he expected the mainland to have fully opened up its capital markets to the world.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China still has capital controls in place so international investors can only rely on schemes such as the stock connects to invest in the mainland, with mainlanders using the channel to invest overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some commentators believe the connect schemes will effectively become irrelevant when capital controls are removed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Very sophisticated international and mainland investors may not use the connect scheme after China fully opens up. But it will remain appealing to general investors as it is an easy and transparent way of conducting cross-border trading easily," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the Shenzhen-Hong Kong connect, we will then explore other type of schemes for bonds, metals and IPOs," he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is also looking at a connect scheme with </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, but Li played down the threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong and mainland stock markets are trading in the same time zone. London and mainland China open at different times," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's chief executive Leung Chun-Ying attended the same forum, and said the cross-border trading scheme is important for capital flow between the mainland and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock connect between Hong Kong and Shenzhen will be another important milestone to tie up the Hong Kong and mainland capital markets," Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While underlining that HKEX is looking at all possibilities to try and attract new-economy companies to list here, Li said nothing on whether he planned to relaunch a consultation into offering a dual-listing share structure in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX proposed last year allowing companies such as Alibaba, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> to also list in Hong Kong, but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> opposed the proposals because of a lack of investor protection measures.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first nine months of this year, there were a total of 98 listings on the two boards to raise US$9.14 billion, down 52.2 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board saw 50 deals worth US$8.65 billion to take a 7.2 per cent global share, ranking it third among the world's top stock exchanges by the amount of proceeds raised. It had topped the global rankings for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> took the top spot with US$20.4 billion from 48 deals, giving it a 16.9 per cent global share.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With only three months to go until the end of the year and no news of any big players planning to list in Hong Kong, the exchange is unlikely to return to the top," said Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It has lost out to other markets such as New York as we have not done enough to attract new-economy companies to list here. We should change our listing regime quickly."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> completed a consultation to set up a new board to allow listings by companies with a dual-class share structure and start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Charles Li ­Xiaojia said the consensus pointed towards carrying out reform to capture new-economy firms but a second consultation had been planned later this year before the new board could be launched.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial sector account­ed for the biggest share of listing proceeds raised in the city in the first nine months of this year, at 60 per cent, followed by health-care firms with 10 per cent and the consumer sector with 9.4 per cent. Hi-tech firms accounted for just 5.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest listing in Hong Kong so far this year was the US$2.2 billion deal by </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> in March, followed by mainland online insurance broker Zhong An Online P&amp;C ­Insurance, which just raised US$1.5 billion last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's global ranking for technology listings was a lowly 13, way behind New York, Shenzhen and Singapore.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed regulations on variable interest entities (VIEs) in a new draft of China's foreign investment law may put more obstacles in the way of companies with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong while encouraging e-commerce firms to incorporate in the Shanghai free-trade zone, lawyers and accountants said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies have been using VIE structures to list overseas, allowing foreign capital to get around Beijing's foreign ownership restrictions on some sectors, such as the internet industry. </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Baidu all use such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In some cases where [China] has imposed shareholding restrictions on foreign investments in certain industries, the VIE structures may shield the shareholders in real control," said Roy Lo Wa-kei, a deputy managing partner of accounting firm Shinewing. "The proposed law would require more disclosure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government could gather more data from VIE firms through the new regulation. But the risks for the companies would be they might have to reveal any practice of non-compliance covered by the VIE structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The draft of the foreign investment law published by the Ministry of Commerce would legitimise VIE structures but also require companies using such structures to prove they were ultimately controlled by Chinese investors, otherwise they would be treated as foreign-invested enterprises and might fall foul of a "negative list" of industries with foreign investment restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law is now in a consultation period, with the deadline for submitting comments on February 17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Haiwen &amp; Partners, a Beijing-based law firm, said the regulations on VIEs could lead to obstacles for firms with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are not yet listed, the clauses on [Chinese] investors selling stakes in offshore companies to foreign investors could be subject to restrictions in the law on foreign investments, such as foreign ownership," Haiwen said in a note to clients. "In some cases, the clauses could not be implemented, thus there may be legal obstacles if they want to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"More disclosure would also be required when they list in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are already listed, restrictions on the transfer of [mainland] shareholders' shares in foreign investment would severely reduce the liquidity of their shares, and affect the valuation of such companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, said Alibaba, Baidu and other firms with dual-class share structures would benefit in the proposed regulatory change as dual-class share structures could help keep the company founders in control, which in turn would ensure their firms were not deemed foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, companies such as Tencent, with VIE structures but without dual-class shares, might be treated as foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed law encourages companies to set up using a dual-class share structure," Gillis said. "Hong Kong does not permit such companies to list, which will be a huge win for New York."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US exchange permits dual-class share structures, which was why Alibaba listed in New York instead of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The consultation paper points to a positive direction that VIE structures will be formally recognised by the [mainland] government and governed by the proposed new legislation," a Tencent spokesman said. "As this is in the early stage of consultation, we are monitoring the progress closely."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In order not to loose access to the Chinese market due to the regulatory change, e-commerce companies without ultimate mainland control might want to incorporate in or move their VIEs to the Shanghai free-trade zone, which had indicated it would allow wholly owned foreign investment in e-commerce, Gillis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Weiss, another law firm preparing to submit comments on the draft law, said more clarity was needed on whether a company would be deemed to have ultimate Chinese control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For example, what if the [Chinese] and foreign investors both satisfy the control definition? What if a founder of a VIE structure has de facto control over the business but only holds a small minority interest in the foreign parent entity controlling the VIE structure and does not have special board appointment rights?" it said in a note to clients.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s latest proposal to cement founder Jack Ma Yun's control of management after a possible listing in the city might be more acceptable to objectors than a dual shareholding structure. But it is not a perfect solution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior sources at the stock market regulators - the Securities and Futures Commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> - have told White Collar categorically that they would reject any application for a dual share structure to allow Ma and Alibaba's management to keep control of the company after a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a logical position. Allowing it would go against similar requests from </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> in the 1990s and the application last year from English football club Manchester United. Dual share structures, permitted in the US but not Hong Kong, give some shareholders more voting rights than the others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulatory sources said they would not consider a dual-shareholding structure because many investors did not like it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"One share, one vote", is what fund managers and investors say is fair and equal in Hong Kong, as do the regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources at Alibaba say that this line of argument is spurious because the firm is not asking for a dual class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What it wants is to be allowed a partnership structure in which senior management would have the power to nominate a simple majority of the board members and then have shareholders vote on those nominations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba, while Japan's </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> own more than 60 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources at Alibaba and bankers close to it portray this as merely a waiver under an existing provision of listing rule 8.11 which states: "The share capital of a new applicant must not include shares of which the proposed voting power does not bear a reasonable relationship to the equity interest of such shares when fully paid."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It lists two exceptions - one in exceptional circumstances agreed by the exchange, and another when listed companies already have dual shares listed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Alibaba argument goes that if the exemption to the rule wasn't intended to be used, it wouldn't have been created.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some might say that is a little like saying rules are there to be broken - or exempted if they don't suit you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Putting that point to one side, this supposed compromise would still have the net effect of reducing the number of candidates that could be nominated as board directors by the firm's major shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That worries regulators who fear their decision could be blamed in any future dispute between Alibaba management and shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They remain concerned about any proposal that may ultimately amount to giving one group of shareholders more rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators must consider this carefully.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two of the world's top business consulting groups, McKinsey's and EY, have urged </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) to be ultra-careful and selective in choosing which firms will be allowed to list on its proposed New Board, or what some are calling “The Third Board”, stock market which will target new-economy, start-up companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Board will be operated separately from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">McKinsey's managing partner of Greater China Joe Ngai said HKEX should only let in start-ups that have solid business models and high prospects of profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a good idea for HKEX to propose the launch of a new market for start-up companies as many will not be able to match the requirement of the main board or the GEM to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But early-stage start-ups should not be allowed to list. If they only have a concept or an idea and no solid business performance or income, they would present too risky a prospect for investors,” he said, speaking at last week's </span><span class="s3">World Economic Forum</span><span class="s1"> in Dalian last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the exchange simply allowed these start-ups to list, it may end up with a market full of poor quality companies, and that would be a repeat of what mistakes were make when the GEM was created.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999, positioning itself then as the Hong Kong version of the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in the US for hi-tech companies to list. But it has been widely considered as a flop in attracting quality tech firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In May 2017, average daily turnover for the GEM was still only HK$742 million (US$95 million), under 1 per cent of the main board's daily average for the same months and even lower than when it was launched with great fanfare in November 1999</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX launched a consultation paper a fortnight ago proposing the Third Board. It is planned to be split into two separate smaller markets: a premium one open to all investors for companies that can match the main board's high requirement, but which have a dual-class share structure which is banned on the main exchange, and another one for start-ups, in which only professional investors to trade only.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ngai believes the Third Board would attract more technology firms to list if retail investors were to trade on it too.The much better option for early-stage start-ups is venture capital or incubator funding. It would be better to let start-ups grow to a certain size and strength before allowing them to list on the proposed new marketJack Chan Hoi, managing partner of financial services for EY in Greater China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong retail investors are smart. Many of them are veterans who can make their own investment choices,” Ngai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adding his backing, too, for only carefully selected entry to the New Board, Jack Chan Hoi, EY's managing partner of financial services of Greater China area, said HKEX must be fearful of allowing start-ups to list too early.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX needs to be selective in the choice - they have to be solid businesses,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The much better option for early-stage start-ups is venture capital or incubator funding. It would be better to let start-ups grow to a certain size and strength before allowing them to list on the proposed new market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The quality and prospects of any company on the board must be impressive,” Chan said, adding he is aware of many mainland start-ups who might like to use the proposed new board to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is a liquid market used by many international investors. HKEX's proposed new board should attract both mainland start-ups and large technology firms to list in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong attracted the largest number of initial public offerings ever for any single third quarter as the new listing rules implemented in April attracted some big tech flotations, while globally the number for equity market deals plunged 21 per cent to a three-year low, according to data from Dealogic on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forty-seven IPOs launched on the Hong Kong market in the July to September period, raising a combined US$16.4 billion, overshadowing the US$14.9 billion raised on US exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest listings during the period included telecoms tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion offering and food delivery service app </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s US$4.2 billion fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with Xiaomi's US$5.4 billion IPO in June, they comprised three of the top five global offerings so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the third quarter, the Hong Kong stock exchange also saw 126 IPO filings, taking the overall number in the first nine months of 2018 to 340, up 48 per cent for the whole of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The surge was helped by the new listing rules that allow companies with dual-class share structure and pre-profit biotech firms to launch IPOs, Dealogic said in its latest equity capital market (ECM) report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The post-IPO performance, however, has been “mediocre”, reflecting a sharp turnaround in investor sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/10/03/c5729c5a-c63e-11e8-9907-be608544c5a1_image_hires_105012.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPOs larger than US$100 million fell by an average 16 per cent from their offer price in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only 30 per cent of the IPOs recorded a retail subscription rate of 15 times or more in the third quarter. That ratio is sharply lower than the second quarter when 77 per cent of the IPOs were oversubscribed 15 times or more. The drop in the ratio indicates a sharp reduction in investor enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165955/china-tech-ipo-boom-continue-least-another-year-says-china]Backed by the IPO activity, Hong Kong's ECM volume also climbed to US$20.6 billion, the highest third-quarter figure in eight years. ECM activities usually include IPOs, private placements, and transactions on the secondary market to help companies raise equity capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Hong Kong's hot ECM market was in contrast to the global landscape. Global ECM volume fell 21 per cent year on year to US$158.4 billion from 1,230 deals, the lowest third-quarter level since 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Technology led all sectors globally, contributing 21.9 per cent of the total quarterly deal volume for ECM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> topped the global ECM bookrunner ranking in the third quarter, with a 9.26 per cent share, followed by </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">' 9.25 per cent and </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">'s 8.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, cross-border Chinese IPO activities were also strong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125873/hong-kong-falling-behind-ny-ipo-rankings-are-investors-ready]Twelve Chinese firms raised US$3.5 billion from the US market in the July to September period, which would have been a record third-quarter if Alibaba's US$25 billion IPO in 2014 is excluded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the same period, Chinese IPOs also made up the lion's share for overall cross-border IPO volume in the US, which reached US$5.7 billion. In the second quarter, the overall cross-border IPO volume was only US$1.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two largest IPOs in the US during the third quarter were both from China - online discounter Pinduoduo's US$1.5 billion listing and electric car maker Nio's US$1 billion offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, PwC Hong Kong predicted in a report on Tuesday that Hong Kong will reclaim the global IPO crown this year with an projected fundraising amount of HK$300 billion (US$38.2 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, the city lost the top IPO spot to New York after two straight years in the position and slipped behind Shanghai for the first time, according to data from Dealogic.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these are not earth-shattering alterations, given their availability on bourses globally for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is largely matching what other Exchanges currently permit,” said Gregg Noel, head of the West Coast capital markets practice at law firm </span><span class="s3">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom LLP</span><span class="s1">, which has advised hundreds of IPOs globally, including Chinese online retailer </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">'s 2014 IPO on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes “will be immensely helpful for Hong Kong to try to take the cream of the crop,” he said, indicating that the rule-easing aims to attract a particular group of fast-growing Chinese tech and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But it is not going to suddenly shift the rest of the global listers' attention entirely to Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also a less-than-adequate challenge to the US IPO market, which remains the most liquid and mature in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“You have the deepest pockets in the US,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management. “The demand is high for Chinese IPOs because the returns are great.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funtleyder's fund, for example, saw its investment in Chinese biopharma company </span><span class="s3">BeiGene Limited</span><span class="s1"> quadruple as the firm's stock rose to US$136 (HK$1,063) after its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> IPO in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US market is also among the most flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong requires every offering to have a retail tranche, US banks can decide whether to sell shares to individual investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, while Hong Kong has a one-week gap between pricing and trading, US shares begin trading the day after they are priced. Both measures help reduce the exposure of companies to US market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class share listing that Hong Kong is expected to introduce has already been offered by many bourses globally for years, including those in the US, Canada, Brazil, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Russia and Finland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1"> opted for a dual-class share structure in its 2004 IPO. Social media company </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1"> took it to an extreme with its US$3.4 billion deal in March 2017 as the first listed company to only issue stock with zero voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such listings, which allow founders of public companies to maintain control of their firms even with minority ownership, have become a favoured tool of tech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's unwillingness to provide </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd</span><span class="s1"> with that option largely forced the Chinese e-commerce company to bypass the city for its gigantic US$25.7 billion listing in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bitter loss of Alibaba was a catalyst in a years-long debate over the need for Hong Kong to loosen its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle between Hong Kong and New York for Chinese tech companies' IPOs has intensified as more start-ups have matured and become ready to seek financing through a public offering. The race became more urgent after a number of high-profile companies bypassed Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Baidu Inc</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Ctrip.com</span><span class="s1"> are among the mega Chinese tech companies that have opted for a </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since 2008, China has been the top source of IPOs by non-American companies in the US; the trend is not expected to slow this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tech has been the biggest sector for Chinese companies listing in the US since at least 2009, according to Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track such data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The country has great tech companies and a strong entrepreneurial culture,” said Bob McCooey, senior vice president of Nasdaq's Listing Services unit. “These founders will be recognised globally when they are listed here [in the US].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early this month, MCooey told the Post that the number of China listings in the US this year was expected to be “materially higher” than a year ago, rising 25 to 30 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The hottest American sectors for Chinese IPOs in the year to come will be data centres, streaming businesses, education, life science, wearables and enterprise technology providers, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One high-profile company, Huami, a Chinese maker of wearable devices that has partnered with Xiaomi, went public on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Hong Kong has been losing ground. While US IPOs surged 55 per cent to 174 deals in 2017, Hong Kong saw just a 28 per cent increase, to 149 IPOs, according to </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">'s December Global IPO Trends report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO growth last year also lagged the 49 per cent average global increase in IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's endeavour to regain IPO market share could hit more bumps as the administration of US President Donald Trump pushes to pare financial regulations to spur economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A top priority for Jay Clayton, the new chief of the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">, the agency responsible for enforcing American securities laws, is to further streamline the IPO process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Clayton, a former capital markets lawyer with the New York firm </span><span class="s3">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</span><span class="s1">, advised on Alibaba's IPO. Since taking the SEC's helm in May, Clayton has been actively looking for ways to encourage more companies to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In prepared testimony, Clayton said in June that “fewer companies are choosing to enter the public capital markets than in the past”. The SEC's aim, he said, was “promoting firms' access to capital markets”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July he expanded a programme that allowed all companies seeking to go public to keep their financials private longer, increasing their flexibility in the listing process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street bankers and lawyers have told the Post they believe a further easing of restrictions is on the way. One area being explored is finding ways to shield public companies from potential shareholder litigation, according to people familiar with the discussions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial communities of both Hong Kong and New York are watching closely as a slew of blockbuster IPOs from Chinese technology firms are in line to go public in the next two years, with an estimated total market capitalisation of US$500 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among them, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, is talking to banks for its planned listing next year, which could be valued at US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, a financial unit of Alibaba that delayed its 2017 IPO plan, was valued at US$60 billion in its latest funding round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, a Chinese online platform for ordering food and booking movies, and Toutiao, a Chinese news aggregator, are other mega IPOs coming in the next 24 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In December, when Hong Kong announced its proposed marketplace changes, the move was touted as “the biggest change of the exchange rules since 1993”, when it opened its door for Chinese enterprises to go public there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The emergence of the new economy, particularly in mainland China, is a fantastic catalyst for us to take a closer look at our business and see if we're as competitive and attractive as we can be,” Hong Kong Stock Exchange CEO Charles Li wrote in a blog post last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect companies from the new economy to begin applying for listing under the new rules by the end of June this year,” Li wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Early responses have been encouraging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This month, smartphone maker Xiaomi was said to favour Hong Kong over New York as the location for its initial stock listing that would be, arguably, this year's most-coveted Chinese tech IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If that happened, Xiaomi, said to be valued at about US$100 billion, would be the first company to take advantage of Hong Kong's newly revamped listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc, a biotech company owned by </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Co, also was reported to be planning a Hong Kong IPO. The offering, expected to occur in the second half of this year, could raise at least US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, Alibaba founder Jack Ma said in January that he would consider listing the company in Hong Kong, during a meeting with city chief Carrie Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong “has made strong progress in attracting more small- and medium-sized companies, a trend that is set to continue,” Terence Ho, Greater China IPO Leader at E&amp;Y wrote in the firm's December report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In particular, it is showing success in turning itself into a listing hub for technology and other ‘new economy' firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's wooing will probably make people think twice about getting listed in New York,E Squared's Funtleyder said,“but the bottom line is, the US continues to have a much deeper market and a really sophisticated investor base.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's regulators should create a more welcoming regulatory system in line with global trends to attract investment, says the founder and chairman of Chinese media mogul CMC Capital, Li Ruigang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A good regulatory system and welcoming economic environment are important to Hong Kong's future, which relies on the vision of the regulators," Li said yesterday when meeting the media for the first time since CMC's investment in the city's dominant free-to-air broadcaster TVB[http://www.scmp.com/topics/tvb] raised concerns last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, dubbed China's Rupert Murdoch, was referring to the "dual share" system that is common among US firms, particulary in Hollywood and the Silicon Valley tech hub of California, but banned in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It allows a minority shareholder - usually the founding shareholder whose stake has been diluted over many rounds of fund-raising - to keep control of key company decisions by having majority voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, who owns a stake in the world's largest entertainment and sports talent agency, also dismissed those who questioned his background and called him a Chinese communist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I sit on the board of </span><span class="s3">Creative Artists Agency</span><span class="s1"> - no one suspects that I am going to turn Hollywood red," he said. "But here in Hong Kong, how come some people labelled me in this way?"</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The topic of dual shares generated fresh discussion last month when the city's stock market regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, flagged concern at CMC's influence in TVB, after the broadcaster disclosed such a shareholding structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pressure is growing on regulators to ease the rules on duals class shares to attract internet start-ups and tech companies wanting to raise capital in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CMC is the single largest shareholder in TVB through its investment in Young Lion Holdings, whcih owns a 26 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC raised concern that Li might not have substantial equity interest in CMC and may not be the ultimate controlling shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li countered by emphasising that he had "complete control" over CMC, owning 86 per cent of voting rights of CMC, despite owning only 26 per cent of its shares under a dual share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Communications Authority, the broadcasting regulator, then engaged a queen's counsel to examine the relevant licence conditions and statutory declarations and deeds of undertaking submitted by TVB and relevant parties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"People seem to hint that there is an invisible hand behind CMC that seeks to influence TVB and Hong Kong . This is totally not true," said Li.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response to regulators' concerns, Li said that the technical shareholder structure of CMC in TVB had already existed before he invested in the broadcaster, saying "it is not his invention."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Hong Kong is an important part of CMC's plan to go global.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That is why CMC invested in TVB and is sister company Shaw Bothers," he said .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He denied rumours that he wanted to sell TVB shares, saying it was a long-term investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I have capital, I have the resources and I have passion in the media and entertainment business. I really want to do something for the entertainment industry in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the recent controversy surrounding CMC and its investment in TVB was not necessarily a bad thing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is good to have the discussion among stakeholders and the public, to see what kind of regulations are good for Hong Kong," said Li, adding that a good regulatory system had made Silicon Valley and Hollywood successful global tech and entertainment hubs.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street cheers Hong Kong's IPO rules revamp but sees New York's dominance unthreatened[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2133566/wall-street-cheers-hong-kongs-ipo-rules-revamp-sees-new-yorks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the listing ceremony on Thursday, Wang Xing, founder and CEO for Meituan, gave special thanks to Steve Jobs, the late Apple founder and former CEO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan offers such services as food delivery, shopping, ticket and hotel booking on its app, which has 340 million users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Shaohui, chief financial officer for Meituan, said the company will strengthen its cooperation with Tencent going forward. The two firms have already worked together on online traffic, cashless pay, marketing and map services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Meituan closes higher, it will buck a trend among recent IPOs in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seven out of the nine IPOs this month quickly dropped below their offer prices on their debut. In August, five out of the eight IPOs did so, while the rest closed unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan has appointed </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> as a stabilising agent for its IPO, which means the underwriter can stabilise or support the share price if it falters after debut during a limited period of time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offering received a mixed response from investors. Retail buyers placed orders 1.5 times the number of shares available. In contrast, China smartphone maker Xiaomi's IPO saw retail investors oversubscribing to its IPO by 8.5 times, placing HK$23 billion worth of orders. In May, Ping An Good Doctor's offering was oversubscribed by 653 times, tieing up HK$370 billion in investor deposits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors “heavily overbought” the stock, Meituan said in a recent exchange filing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, subscribed for Meituan shares in the international placement, according to sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Lau Luen-hung, former chairman of Chinese Estates and Adrian Cheng, executive vice-chairman of New World Development, were also among high-profile investors subscribing to the offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hillhouse Capital and Tiger Fund, the existing investors of the Beijing-based company, have also sought stakes in the IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan is the second listed company on the Hong Kong stock exchange to have a weighted voting rights share structure, which gives founders greater voting power over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five cornerstone investors had previously agreed to invest a combined US$1.5 billion, according to its prospectus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York-based investment firm Oppenheimer Fund is the largest cornerstone investor, committing US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent, which already owns a 20 per cent stake in Meituan, is investing US$400 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">London-based hedge fund Lansdowne Partners and New York-based asset manager Darsana Capital Partners have agreed to put in US$300 million and US$200 million respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Structural Reform Fund, a state-owned restructuring fund backed by shareholders including China Chengtong Holdings, China Merchants Group and </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, will invest US$100 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Xing controls 11.4 per cent of the firm, smaller than Tencent's 20 per cent share and equal to that of </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">. But he, along with two other co-founders, retains majority voting rights through special class A shares, with each class A share equivalent to 10 votes. Tencent and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> both own class B shares, with each having one vote.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji recruited then Hong Kong securities regulator Laura Cha Shih May-lung to help bring order to the mainland's unruly emerging stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seventeen years later, she is now responsible for overseeing implementation of reforms to ensure the local bourse is the No 1 destination for mainland company listings, ahead of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore and New York. Cha, 68, nominated enhancement of the city's competitiveness as her greatest challenge after the board of directors of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> elected her as its chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This reflected the greatest regret of retiring chairman Chow Chung-kong - the failure of the bourse to land the US$25 billion initial public offering of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, now owner of the South China Morning Post, in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba listed in New York because its dual-class share structure was not then accepted in Hong Kong under the principle of one share, one vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This prompted debate culminating in the introduction this week of the biggest listing reforms in 25 years, including the acceptance of applications from companies with dual-class shares, and from biotechnology firms that have no record of generating revenue and therefore would not meet the financial eligibility tests of the main board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a perfect world, the one-share, one-vote principle served Hong Kong well as the exchange developed sound regulatory practices and built a reputation for investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the real world of the new economy, innovation and risk-taking, however, dual-class shares are more attractive to company founders and key executives who want to retain control with minority shareholdings as a company grows and attracts more investor capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, a career financial regulator and an executive councillor, left the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> to join the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> as vice-chairman between 2001 to 2004.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland stock markets were plagued by insider trading and illicit deals. Cha struggled against vested interests to establish sound regulatory practices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She returned home to serve on the board of HKEX before becoming chairman of the Financial Services Development Council for the past few years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While looking forward to a liberalised listing regime, let us not forget the penny stocks and their ilk - including the notorious Enigma Network - that have thrived in the city's laissez-faire regulatory environment to filch many illiterate minority investors of their life savings.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With big Chinese technology and internet initial public offerings potentially in the pipeline, Hong Kong's decision to revamp its IPO rules could tip the balance in its favour as it battles for China listings with New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies are increasingly more positive on Hong Kong as a preferred listing destination,” said Mervyn Chow, the co-head of investment banking and capital markets, Asia-Pacific, and Greater China chief executive at Credit Suisse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said on Friday it would propose rule changes to allow dual-class shares on the main board, with a formal public consultation to be launched as early as the first quarter of 2018. The overhaul in listing regulations could be the city's most drastic in three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rule changes to allow dual-class shares will enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness vis-a- vis the US, especially for Chinese technology IPOs. It is the right timing for Hong Kong to make these changes. It will be a game changer,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why does Hong Kong need dual-class stocks, with tech IPOs aplenty? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124799/why-did-hong-kong-replace-our-one-share-one-vote-principle-dual]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a group of rapidly expanding Chinese technology and internet companies nears the stage of going public, the battle for big Chinese listings has intensified between Hong Kong and its fundraising rivals, such as New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the privately owned Chinese smartphone maker, has been in talks with investment banks for a possible IPO as soon as next year, which might value the company at more than US$50 billion, versus a valuation of US$46 billion at its most recent funding round in 2014, according to media reports. Either Hong Kong or New York could host the listing, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong refits listing rules in race with New York for IPO crown [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124503/hong-kong-overhauls-citys-stock-listing-rules-attract-biotech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If valued at US$50 billion, Xiaomi's float will be the third-largest technology IPO in history, surpassing Snap's US$24 billion listing in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> , which owns the South China Morning Post, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> rank No. 1 and No. 2, with valuations of US$167 billion and US$104 billion, respectively, when they were listed in 2014 and 2012 in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> , has also invited investment banks to handle its planned listing next year, which could value the unit at US$10 billion, Bloomberg reported recently, citing unnamed sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has already seen a flurry of fundraising in 2017 by technology and internet companies, with five of its 10 largest IPOs by companies operating in the new economy, compared with none last year. Listings by banks and securities companies, staples of Hong Kong's capital market, have halved to 30 per cent of this year's top IPOs, from 60 per cent last year, in line with regulators' goals to draw more new economy companies to float here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, Tencent's China Literature debuted on the Hong Kong market, and its US$1.06 billion IPO attracted overwhelming investor demand, in what was the hottest listing in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other potential technology IPOs in the forthcoming year could include: </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Company of China's peer-to-peer online-lending platform Lufax, which could raise up to US$5 billion in a planned Hong Kong IPO as soon as the first half of 2018; its Chinese rival Dianrong.com, backed by Singapore's GIC, which is also considering a Hong Kong listing to raise least US$500 million; as well as Hong Kong's online finance lending platform WeLab, with a possible listing size of US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu's video streaming site </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is targeting an IPO as soon as next year, to value it at up to US$10 billion, with New York a possible listing destination, according to reports this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is Hong Kong's IPO fever over after Nissin and Shandong Trust fail to excite? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> , the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> fintech affiliate that operates Alipay, has delayed its IPO. Jack Ma Yun , the Alibaba chairman, said last month he would possibly consider an IPO for </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> in two years, but not in the next 12 to 18 months. The venue for this listing is also undecided. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> was valued at US$60 billion in its last funding round in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> 's Chow said Chinese issuers usually prefer a Hong Kong listing, as it is closer to their home market and enables access to a larger pool of international as well as mainland investors, who typically have a good understanding of the business models and the products that tend to be relevant locally. “This has been important for Chinese technology firms, which are largely ‘product companies' focused on building and selling products to consumers.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the proposed move to a dual-class share structure, more innovative companies might choose Hong Kong as a listing destination. Moreover, the changes might bring new opportunities for investors, which would boost the liquidity of the city's capital market, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These opportunities include new IPO products, such as potentially a trading link to enable mainland investors to buy into Hong Kong IPOs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital, said he had already seen a rising willingness among his clients in China to favour Hong Kong as an IPO destination. Wan said he expected the first dual-class share company to appear on the Hong Kong market as early as the second half of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year we've had several hot tech IPOs, such as ZhongAn Online, China Literature and Razer, which have ignited investors' enthusiasm towards new-economy stocks and raised expectations about more tech and internet listings coming to Hong Kong, such as the highly anticipated IPOs of Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> ,” said Kenny Shui, a senior researcher at Our Hong Kong Foundation, a Hong Kong-based think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a key issue would be how Hong Kong can protect retail investors at the same time, as dual-class shares give company founders much more power over their business even if they hold a small portion of the shares, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma Yun, the founder of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, had expressed several times his preference for Hong Kong as the listing venue of his company. But the mainland e-commerce titan announced over the weekend that it had dropped Hong Kong for Wall Street as the site of an initial public offering that may value the firm at up to US$120 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba dumped Hong Kong because the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq allowed a corporate structure that gives top executives the right to nominate a majority of the company's board members even if their holdings are not substantial, whereas Hong Kong did not allow such a dual-share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma owns less than 8 per cent of Alibaba, while </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> has a 36.7 per cent stake and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> controls 24 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent, on the other hand, is led by Pony Ma Huateng, who holds a 10.2 per cent stake. The company was listed in Hong Kong in 2004 at an offer price of HK$3.70. The majority shareholder is Naspers, a South Africa-based media company with a 33.8 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack and Pony are not related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But why does Pony Ma care little about the listing structure, while Jack Ma sees it as a deal breaker?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Xingliang, chairman of Hongmai Software, a Beijing-based internet data analysis firm, said the key difference lay in the majority shareholders at the two firms. "Naspers focuses on media and doesn't know very much about the internet. It gives the management of Tencent lots of trust and freedom," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, however, had abundant internet experience and were confident they "know" the business, he said. "When a person thinks he knows, he will try back-seat driving," he said, adding that people never heard about friction between Tencent and Naspers, but there were a lot of "unharmonious noises" between Alibaba and its majority shareholders, which is not really a secret.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has been trying to buy its stake back from </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> since 2010, but </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> has said no.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keso Hong Bo, founder of the mainland's technology website DoNews and a seasoned observer of the internet industry, said Naspers trusted Pony Ma would run the firm well and Ma trusted Naspers wanted the firm to have a good future. "But the trust between Alibaba and its big shareholders is quite problematic," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When </span><span class="s3">Alibaba.com</span><span class="s1"> the world's largest business-to-business e-commerce service provider under the group, was listed in Hong Kong in 2007, Jack Ma did not ask for a special partnership structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong said Alibaba insisted on the partnership this time because the assets to go public were much more important. "This time, the core business </span><span class="s3">Taobao.com</span><span class="s1"> is included. When </span><span class="s3">Alibaba.com</span><span class="s1"> was listed, it was already a mature business and does not have much room for growth," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lawyer who helped Tencent in its share offer said she advised the firm on listing in Hong Kong instead of going to the United States. She said that although a large number of dotcom companies and investors in the US appreciated the value of internet firms, Tencent would be regarded as just another Chinese firm. In Hong Kong, however, it would be a star. That turned out to be true.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in Tencent closed at HK$578 yesterday, 156 times above its offer price almost 10 years ago.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore's effort to score the 2018 listing of state oil giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> - expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering - is the latest show of its ambition to develop an elite global exchange, but analysts say a lack of liquidity in the Lion City should mean Hong Kong will hold firm as Asia's top bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fierce courtship of Aramco has brought into focus how the region's exchanges are dangling new carrots to attract multibillion-dollar listings that have dried up since the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba in 2014 - the largest to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One incentive being considered in Singapore and Hong Kong is an easing of the one-share, one-vote orthodoxy in order to accommodate technology companies that prefer dual-class share structures in which the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco, which is planning an initial listing of just five per cent of its equity in 2018, has so far not shown an interest in dual-class shares, but Singapore is offering other sweeteners. These include the possibility that GIC, one of the city state's two sovereign wealth funds, could become a cornerstone investor. On February 2, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom was considering concurrent listings of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With its estimated oil reserves of 265 billion barrels - or 15 per cent of the world's proven reserves - the company is expected to be valued at around US$2 trillion. A five per cent flotation would raise US$100 billion, four times the amount raised by Alibaba, the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco's share offer is the centrepiece of the influential Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's strategy to attract foreign investment and wean the country off its dependence on oil revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market observers said the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX), the city state's sole stock market operator, would be looking to differentiate itself from the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (NYSE) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) by touting the island nation's neutral stance in geopolitics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US President Donald Trump's erratic Middle East foreign policy, coupled with legislation passed last year that allows victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, are seen in some quarters as factors that could deter Aramco from listing on the NYSE. With Hong Kong, questions remain over the extent of the city's legal autonomy from Beijing, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The biggest case for Singapore to woo Aramco would be that it is a truly neutral ground compared to everywhere else,” said Song Seng Wun, a Singapore-based economist with CIMB Private Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On purely market-based factors, however, the Singapore exchange is unlikely to upstage its bigger counterpart in Hong Kong any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily value of shares traded in the Lion City in January was S$1.05 billion (HK$5.74 billion), about a 10th of the HK$57.2 billion worth of shares traded in Hong Kong over the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total market capitalisation of SGX in 2016 was S$926 billion (HK$5.06 trillion), compared with HK$24.8 trillion in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore is just a smaller, niche market with limited liquidity compared to Hong Kong,” said Song, the Singapore-based economist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eddie Wong, partner of capital markets services at PwC in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong had an advantage over its regional rivals because of its deep ties with the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People [on the mainland] like doing deals in a familiar place and with people they know,” Wong said. Apart from mainland Chinese firms, South Asian companies were also increasingly showing interest in being listed in Hong Kong, Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An endemic lack of liquidity and the difficulty in luring Chinese IPOs away from Hong Kong are just two of several obstacles the SGX is facing. Its ambition of being an “Asian Gateway” is increasingly under threat by the rising stature of other Southeast Asian bourses like the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the </span><span class="s3">Indonesia Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, and Malaysia's Bursa Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite falling global deal volumes, Asian exchanges are likely to see an uptick in flotations as “it is relatively early days for many of the equity markets in Asia including mainland China and many Southeast Asian markets,” said David Erickson, the former co-head of global equity markets at </span><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ace up Singaporean stock market regulators' sleeves could be the introduction of dual class shares before the city's rivals. Technology start-ups have shown a preference for such tiered stocks, but critics charge that they give founders outsized control cheaply and disadvantage minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on Alibaba's IPO because the Chinese e-commerce giant was adamant on a tiered share structure that the city's rules do not permit. SGX was edged out by the NYSE for the 2012 IPO of English football giant </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> for the same reason. The city state has not had a multibillion-dollar IPO since the 2011 listing of </span><span class="s3">Hutchison Port Holdings Trust</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye in January said the exchange would soon launch a public consultation on permitting dual class shares. HKEX chief Li Xiaojia, meanwhile, has said the exchange will launch a similar exercise. The Hong Kong had plans to relaunch dual class shares in 2015 (they have been banned in the city since 1989) but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> shot down the idea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If Singapore goes ahead with the plan, I am afraid it will be a race to the bottom. Hong Kong will not be able to resist the political pressure to [introduce dual-class shares] and both markets will hurt themselves,” said Jamie Allen, the Hong Kong-based secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. “It goes against the principle of fairness...dual-class structures are unfair to minority shareholders,” said Allen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuck Seng Tham, capital markets leader at PwC in Singapore, said risks associated with tiered share structures could be “properly managed instead of avoided, with the appropriate safeguards”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said Singapore and Hong Kong were unlikely to make a decision on dual-class shares by the end of this year. ■</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How well Hong Kong's proposed new third board functions as stepping stone to a main board listing could be a determining factor in its success, according to Edward Au, co-leader, national public offering group at Deloitte.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The more the proposed board functions as a pathway to enable companies to ascend to the prestigious main board, the greater its drawing power as a home for start-ups and other large tech companies, Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To help smooth the process, he urged for company disclosure to be of a higher standard than that of the main and GEM boards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ‘third board' emerges as threat to Hong Kong's IPO market[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1961549/chinas-third-board-emerges-threat-hong-kongs-ipo-market]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China new third board, known officially as the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), has developed rapidly through several layers of reforms but company disclosure and regulation still follow a different set of rules from companies that trade on the main board in Shanghai. This means companies will face difficulty moving up to the main board when they grow larger.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong's GEM board was able to reposition as a stepping stone towards the main board because the company disclosure and foundations use the same set of rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The number of listings on the potential new board may be boosted if it is implemented in a similar fashion to the GEM,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of listings on GEM in the first half of this year has risen to its highest level since the inception of the board in 1999, Au said. A total of 35 companies raised a combined HK$2.5 billion (US$320 million), the largest amount raised in the first half since 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GEM is positioned for listing small and medium companies, while the main board is geared towards large companies. The proposed third board is for new economy and technology companies. It will also accept companies with a dual share structure if transparency, investor risk protection, and regulation is raised.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which runs the stock exchange, earlier this month issued a public consultation on the proposal to launch a third board, after the main board and growth enterprise market, with more flexible rules to attract tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two markets, one for large companies that match all the main board requirements but who cannot list here because they have dual-class stock structures, while the other will be for start-ups.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scramble by mainland China's two stock markets to lure foreign-funded technology firms is firmly back on track, as its financial regulators revisit their plan to create a fast track mechanism for share offerings by what many consider will be the profitmaking stars of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this time, their on-off-on-again plan - first revealed way back in 2001 - is set to have greater substance, say commentators, since the leadership is more determined than ever to inject some entrepreneurial vigour into the economy to drive long-term growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will ratchet up the pressure on Hong Kong, as a tug of war over listing resources gradually takes the strain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend it has prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting “unicorns” - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and has already visited to a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invited them to Shanghai, so they can gain first-hand experience (of our facilities and systems),” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are also reaching out to help them overcome difficulties in accessing the capital markets,” it added, without casting a light on any actual names.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's top securities regulators, including chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, confirmed last week too that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's own securities regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), and its stock exchange are also conducting the city's largest listing reforms in decades, aimed at enhancing the bourse's attractiveness to technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June, large biotech companies, for instance, without strong revenue track records as well as more mainstream technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures will be allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That dual-class share structure, will allow shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends, and is favoured by many tech founders as the majority hold minority stakes but still want to maintain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> (which owns the South China Morning Post) chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC quickly recognised the competitive pressures this put the city under in attracting listings by new-economy companies, and threw its weight last December behind its own proposed listing reforms, that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology firms being courted by both exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland have chosen to list A-shares only - yuan-denominated shares bought and traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges - because of the domestic market's higher valuations and the convenience,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expect to this see-saw game between the two markets[Hong Kong and the mainland] intensifying in coming years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, a would-be, fast track listing mechanism proposed to be launched in 2015 was seen as a winning formula which underlined its efforts to set up a dedicated board for emerging industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was put on ice after a summer stock market rout exacerbated regulator worries about a further slide in key economic indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That board was particularly designed to welcome relistings by privatised Chinese tech firms, which had previously traded in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Foxconn Industrial Internet - a unit of the world's largest contract manufacturer whose products include Apple's iPhones - received the go-ahead from the CSRC to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai, just five short weeks after it filed an application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The green light granted to the 27 billion yuan (US$4.27 billion) fundraising was the clearest sign yet that the CSRC is now prioritising technology IPOs as a way of bolstering the country's levels of technical innovation - a key component of the Chinese leadership's attempt to create an economy reliant on slower, but more sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the country's promising start-ups have been backed in the past by foreign private equity and venture capital funds, under the so-called VIE (variable interest entity) structure, and could only list in markets such as Hong Kong and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A VIE structure allows founders and investment funds to set up offshore vehicles which can sign contracts with Chinese firms, giving the latter effective control of the resultant offshore vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To woo VIE firms into an A-share listing, regulators now need to amend securities and corporate laws and revise domestic listing rules, as direct investment in China's A-share market is off-limits to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange says it has already started putting together a blueprint to attract IPOs by foreign companies, particularly “red chips”, or mainland companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, but with controlling Chinese shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Shanghai exchange officials said its fresh initiative to attract technology-leading IPOs has the solid backing of the Chinese leadership, further north in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of their agenda is clearly creating the next generation of tech behemoths on a par with established leaders such as Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, with the full backing of the domestic capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the Shanghai exchange beating its Hong Kong counterpart in terms of value for IPOs for the first time last year, the signs are strong that more investors could well take the bait.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stock market regulators will not grant any special exemptions to ensure a local share listing for mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has piled pressure on </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx), which has seen share listings fall 28 per cent in the first half of 2013 from a year ago, by threatening to take the potentially US$15 billion deal to New York unless a controversial plan to cement management control in founder Jack Ma Yun's hands is accepted. If we want to introduce a dual shareholders structure, we would need to first do a public consultation, but at the moment we have no plan to do so Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEx</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US listing rules allow a dual share structure that could grant Ma and Alibaba management the control they crave. Hong Kong rules do not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There will be no exceptions," a top official at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the ultimate approver of share listings in Hong Kong, told the Post on condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source close to Alibaba said the firm neither wanted nor required a dual class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, it is proposing to use existing rules on board-level appointments to allow the firm's senior management to maintain a partnership structure to nominate a majority of board candidates, on whom shareholders would then be allowed to vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The company is not asking the exchange to do anything special for it," said the source, who declined to be identified. "This solution would leave all shareholder rights intact."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The internet giant, which is expected to list its shares before the end of this year, has more than 20 partners including Ma, his co-founders and senior executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, which own more than 60 per cent of the firm's share, are not included in the partnership programme, which was established in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A senior source at HKEx told the Post that the exchange would consider a scheme that did not seek to curtail the voting rights of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"At present, the major shareholders or management always have the right to nominate directors, which will be subject to shareholders' approval. As long as Alibaba could suggest that its nomination process would not affect shareholder protections, HKEx would consider it," the HKEx source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under Hong Kong's regulation, the SFC has the right to reject any listing applications and a source with the regulator told the Post that there would be no exemptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, the chief executive of HKEx, said after the results announcement of the exchange last week that the exchange put shareholder protection as its priority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If we want to introduce a dual shareholders structure, we would need to first do a public consultation, but at the moment we have no plan to do so," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We would approve any listing application that has shareholder protection as its priority. Other markets may have different ways to do it and we would consider their practices, but at the end of the day, we would not sacrifice shareholder protection."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it is working with local and mainland authorities to fight to get Saudi Arabia's national oil giant, Aramco, to list in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest initial public offering in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For a giant company like </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the stock exchange alone would not be able to fight for its listing in Hong Kong. We are working with the Hong Kong and central governments and all related authorities to try our best to fight for its listing here,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, which operates the local bourse.Its listing here would be good for China, enabling it to play a more important role in the international resources marketCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are working very hard on it and we welcome </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to choose to list here in whatever format it prefers. Its listing here would be good for China, enabling it to play a more important role in the international resources market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Addressing reporters after the bourse's annual general meeting on Wednesday, Li said if Hong Kong was in a position to launch the “IPO connect” scheme at the same time as the Aramco listing, it would provide an additional incentive for the oil leviathan to list here. HKEX is working with Hong Kong and mainland regulators on a link which would allow international investors to subscribe to newly listed A-shares, while mainlanders could subscribe to IPOs in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The existing stock connects between HKEX and the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen only allow investors to do cross border trading in companies already listed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be the perfect match to launch the IPO connect and the </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> IPO at the same time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco has already appointed </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> as one of its advisers for the flotation which is expected to raise up to US$100 billion, the biggest sum ever raised through a shares listing. That estimate is based on expectations that Aramco will offer 5 per cent of its equity, valuing the company at about US$2 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The state owned oil company is still considering possible venues for its debut, with New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo the main contenders.</span></p>

But brokers point out London and New York have traditionally been the destinations of choice for oil companies to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> two weeks ago issued a statement declaring it would ease listing conditions for companies linked to “One Belt, One Road” initiatives to help develop Hong Kong's stock market.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is keen to expand its IPO market after it lost out to New York, Shanghai and Shenzhen to rank as the fourth largest IPO market worldwide in the first quarter. A lack of new mega listings meant the city lost its coveted No 1 spot which it had held in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the exchange would soon launch a consultation paper about introducing a third board for new listings of technology firms including those wanting to float with a dual-class share structure - something currently banned from the main board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Shi has many public faces: </span><span class="s3">University of Cambridge</span><span class="s1"> visiting scholar, passionate mountaineer, spokesman for a jeep brand and new president of the Asian Rowing Federation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it's as chairman of China's largest property developer, Vanke, that he is facing the struggle of his life in a battle for control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The over six-month long saga that has seen the company's shares suspended and personal battles break out between Wang and major shareholders has worried investors, but more importantly it has highlighted corporate governance problems long rooted in Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The professional manager system is not mature in China and many companies are still ruled by the voice of one man alone,” said Dong Dengxin, a finance researcher at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A modern enterprise should separate powers between boards, shareholders and managements and decisions have to be made through a decision-making mechanism,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The saga began last December when Shenzhen-based property and insurance conglomerate Baoneng upped its stake in Vanke to 24.26 per cent, becoming its largest shareholder and overtaking the holding of state-backed conglomerate </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1">, which had maintained a friendly relationship with Vanke for 15 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/06/17/926bbeb8-3478-11e6-b997-a8e2995ff455_image_hires.jpg]Vanke's shares were suspended on December 18 when Wang, denouncing Baoneng and its head, the tycoon Yao Zhenhua, as “barbarians”, said Vanke did not welcome Baoneng as a shareholder.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He began his fightback soon after, and in March this year he introduced state-backed subway operator Shenzhen Metro as a “white knight” investor in an attempt to dilute Baoneng's holding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This backfired, however, when </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> complained it wasn't consulted and deemed the deal non-compliant.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since Vanke plans to acquire up to 60 billion yuan worth of property projects from Shenzhen Metro, mostly atop subway stations in the city, through issuing new shares and making the subway operator its biggest investor, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1">' holding could be diluted as well as Baoneng's.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That prospect, according to one </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> insider, made its chairman “inflamed with rage”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wuhan University</span><span class="s1">'s Dong said the strain on that relationship had caused problems for Wang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past, it is better to say </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> trusted in Wang Shi rather than in Vanke, and that supported Vanke's stable development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But now such a balance has been broken both internally and externally,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland media reports have also said that the relationship between the managements of Vanke and </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> is not as close since </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> appointed a new chairman Fu Yuning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang had been good friends with the conglomerate's previous leaders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang had opted for a different approach to leadership in Vanke's early years. In 1988, when the then four-year-old Vanke was reformed into a joint-stock operation, Wang, the founder and chairman, gave up his shares and donated them to a charity fund, but remained chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He set out his views in a public speech in 2014, when he said he chose to be a professional manager as he had the confidence to win the trust from the board and manage the company though his ability, not via a controlling interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In China, you have to pick one from fame and fortune … and I picked fame,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some analysts said that Wang's approach might be the root cause of the problems the company faces.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As a professional manager, why does Wang Shi always feel he can make the final decisions for the company? If he wants to decide who can be the shareholders, why let Vanke go public? ” said a property analyst who asked not to be identified.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“He introduced his ally [Shenzhen Metro] at the expense of the interests of both major and minority shareholders. Major shareholders may still have room for negotiation, but what can minority shareholders do?” said another analyst, who also requested anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2016/06/17/92c2db3a-3478-11e6-b997-a8e2995ff455_image_hires.jpg]Vanke has relied on a dispersed ownership structure for many years.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang, as of the end of 2015, held only 0.069 per cent of the shares of the company, while the whole senior management team collectively had only about 0.2 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The system confirms no one shareholder can dominate the company, but on the downside, it makes the share structure fragile and means the company can easily be taken over.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The management had become aware of this issue and in 2014 introduced an employee partnership scheme that pools bonuses of employees to buy Vanke shares as a way to fend off any takeover. However, the scheme only accounts for 4.14 per cent of the company, not enough to block any hostile bid.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is possible, however, that Wang's problem with Baoneng may solve itself.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said privately owned Baoneng is no match for either </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> or Shenzhen Metro, which are both state-owned, in scale and reach.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is highly possible therefore that Baoneng would exit Vanke if it could get a fair price for its holding, though that would still leave Wang's position unclear.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Baoneng's exit is almost certain, but who would control Vanke is hard to predict,” said Ding Zuyu, chief executive of consultancy E-House China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the time being, the market's focus is on a restructuring plan that Vanke said it would submit by around the middle of this month, and on when trading in its Shenzhen shares can resume.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the plan is announced, it could take 10 working days for the Shenzhen stock exchange to grant approval, so that would mean the shares would not resume trading until July 4, according to </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But even with exchange approval, it is not a given that Vanke will get the nod from the two thirds of shareholders it would need at an extraordinary general meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang's fight is set to go on.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Financial Services Development Council in Hong Kong has pledged its support for the local bourse to launch a third board to draw technology firms and other overseas companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council, a government-appointed advisory body, in 2014 recommended Hong Kong follow Britain in setting up multiple markets to introduce different boards with different listing rules that are tailor-made for the needs of diverse investors and firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the council first made these recommendations, there wasn't much reaction from the markets and other regulators. Now it has become a hot topic recently as the stock exchange will soon have a consultation on the launch of the third board,” chairman Laura Cha Shih May-lung said at the council's annual media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing rules in Hong Kong have not changed much in the past 20 years. We would support such a review as keeping an open mind is important in attracting different companies to list in Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week that a consultation paper would be issued by the end of this month on the launch of the third board and the review of the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rules on the third board are expected to be more flexible than those on the main board and the GEM in order to attract listings by technology firms, start-ups, overseas companies and those with dual-shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> prefer dual-class share structure as their founders hold only minority stakes but want to retain control. But unlike the US, which has drawn many technology firms to list there, Hong Kong does not allow this kind of structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said the council had in the past three years issued 30 reports ranging from proposals to improve listings, green financing and fund management in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many of these reports were the result of the studies by scores of financial professionals. The regulators have followed up on these recommendations but that was usually done in a slow pace. We would like to see quicker follow-ups in future,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides the third board, she believes the green financing proposals would be equally important for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Green financing refers to financial investments and products like bonds that are issued to fund sustainable development projects and initiatives such as pollution reduction and the promotion of the use of renewable energy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many projects of the ‘Belt and Road Initiative' are related to green financing. Hong Kong needs to do more to promote green financing. Otherwise, we would lose out to other markets in the competition for the role as the fundraising hub for the belt and road projects,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched by Beijing in 2013, the global trade initiative aims to build more roads, railways and other infrastructure projects in the more than 60 countries along the route to boost trade and economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> may be one of the most supported sports teams in the world, but that doesn't mean the soccer club is going to find many investors with an appetite for its planned initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fund managers who have looked at its preliminary prospectus have been either negative or lukewarm on the prospect of buying shares in the club, which is controlled by the Florida-based Glazer family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They say </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> faces significant financial risks, given its £423 million (HK$5.1 billion) of debt, and the very structure of the business puts its customers, the fans, at odds with shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some are concerned that the US stock market hasn't had many sports team listings, let alone European soccer clubs, so there isn't much to compare </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> against.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With a sports franchise, it's a constant tug of war between player salaries' cost and the rest of the operation," says Wallace Weitz, president and portfolio manager at Weitz Funds in Omaha, Nebraska, which holds stakes in </span><span class="s3">Liberty Media Corp</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Walt Disney Corp</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Comcast Corp</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> declined to comment, and representatives for the Glazers could not be immediately reached.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many sports franchises, the team's success on the pitch is largely contingent on its ability to spend cash on players through both transfer fees and high wages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there have been some signs in the past year that transfer spending by top English clubs is being reined in, the pressure on a leading club to spend heavily in an attempt to stay a top team remains. That spending can eat up profits and lead to volatile financial results.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, if a club such as </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> cuts costs and doesn't go into the market for expensive new players, the value of its brand can be at risk. That may not happen to a top club with just one weak season, but over a few years, the value of everything from television rights to sales of club merchandise can be hit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> had a weak season by its own standards last season, failing to win any silverware, although it missed out on the English title by a hair's breadth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The deal is a strong vanity play in terms of being part of a winning franchise, but whether or not that mystique around the team translates to money for shareholders, I doubt it," says Jeff Sica, president and chief investment officer of Sica Wealth Management in Morristown, New Jersey, which manages more than US$1 billion in assets. "The chances of shareholders making money on this are very low."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, many investors will not make a final decision until they know how many shares the company will sell and at what price. The timing of the IPO is also unclear.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A valuation analysis will not be easy even when the price is known because of the lack of comparable public companies in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The media, sports and entertainment group </span><span class="s3">Madison Square Garden Co</span><span class="s1"> owns the </span><span class="s3">New York Knicks</span><span class="s1"> basketball team and the Rangers ice hockey team; media and entertainment company Liberty Media owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team; and cable giant </span><span class="s3">Comcast</span><span class="s1"> owns the Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team. But none is purely a sports play.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's just not a lot of data out there," says Mark Donovan, a portfolio manager with Boston-based </span><span class="s3">Robeco Investment Management</span><span class="s1">, which owns shares of </span><span class="s3">Disney</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Comcast</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Sports franchises have been the playgrounds of rich entrepreneurs who want a big expensive toy to play with, but I don't really know if they pass the test for return on investment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Teams that have listed in the US in the past also haven't performed well for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Boston Celtics of the NBA, which were publicly traded for 16 years beginning in 1986, posted three straight years of losses before swinging to a profit in 2002. Shares were thinly traded and held primarily by individual investors, not institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Cleveland Indians</span><span class="s1"> baseball team went public in 1998 at US$15 before seeing shares drop to US$5.38 within four months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both teams are now privately owned. And unlike these teams, </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> doesn't play in the United States, other than for occasional exhibition games in the summer months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It may have a large base of armchair fans in the US who watch English games on television, but that isn't comparable to the almost religious nature of the support in Britain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One particular problem is that some of the legendary English club's millions of fans around the world have shown a rabid dislike for the Glazers, who acquired the 134-year-old team in 2005 through a leveraged buyout.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whether through sizeable demonstrations at games or comments on fan websites, they have slammed the Florida-based Glazers for loading up the club with large amounts of debt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another red flag is that medium-sized investment bank </span><span class="s3">Jefferies Group</span><span class="s1"> was picked to be lead underwriter on the offering only after </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> bowed out because of concerns over the team's proposed valuation, according to sources familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> had been set to participate in the underwriting earlier this year, when the Glazer family sought to list the team in Singapore, raising US$1 billion. That plan was initially slated for last year but was pushed back because of market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The team also toyed with the idea of listing in Hong Kong, but investors in the US are largely seen as more accepting of the dual share structure that the Glazers wanted for the offering - a structure that allows them to retain almost complete control even after selling a large stake. Jefferies and </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> declined comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are still a number of big banks helping to underwrite the deal, including </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One concern among investors is that the team's cash balance - which it dips into to attract top players - stood at just £26 million as of March, down from £151 million in June last year. The lack of plans for a dividend is another.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its revenue rose 6 per cent to £245.8 million in the nine-month period ending in March, while its after-tax profit climbed to £38.2 million from £13.3 million for the same period the year before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But despite the improved figures, there are signs of strain. Its net finance costs in the latest nine-month period were £35 million, swallowing up more than two-thirds of its operating profit of £50.7 million. Much of its net profit was due to a £22.5 million tax credit, which is unlikely to be sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The revenue from the sale of television rights to its games, which made up roughly one-third of </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1">'s overall revenue last year, is based on contracts with the Premier League and Champions League, and are at least partially based on its players' success on the field.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its match day revenue, meanwhile, is generated from the fluctuating number of games </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> plays each year. Reuters<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers and fund managers are urging Hong Kong's government and stock exchange to introduce new platforms to help technology firms raise funds, saying the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) has failed in its mission to become the city's version of </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They say Hong Kong should allow crowdfunding or a new board with more relaxed listing requirements for newly set-up technology firms looking to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his budget speech in February, Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah set a goal of encouraging more start-ups by information technology companies and other innovative firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ricky Tsang, managing director of CaSO (HK) Engineering, a local company which sells environmentally friendly construction materials, wants the government to do more to help technology or innovative firms set up, because the stock market has not been helpful when they have sought to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The GEM has set an entry level that is too high, while the main board threshold is even higher," he said. "The stock market in Hong Kong only allows proven, successful technology firms to raise funds to expand their business further, rather than acting as a platform for newly set-up firms to raise money."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange introduced the GEM in 1999 for new firms that had yet to make a profit, while the main board continued to require candidates to have a combined profit of at least HK$50 million in the three years before listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But 15 years on, the GEM has been a failure. The 19 new listings on the GEM last year raised a total of HK$2.06 billion, just 0.9 per cent of the HK$225.68 billion raised by 103 flotations on the main board. Only 204 firms are listed on the GEM, compared with 1,548 on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, executive director of Sun Hung Kai Financial, said GEM board listing requirements could be too high for many technology firms. Companies which want to list on the GEM need to have two years of operating history and a positive cash flow generated from operating activities of at least HK$20 million in aggregate for the two financial years immediately preceding their application for listing. They also need to have a minimum market cap of HK$100 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These are not easy targets for new start-up companies, especially for technology companies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) should consider establishing another over-the-counter (OTC) board which would adopt a different set of IPO regulations, such as using a gross revenues benchmark instead of cash flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China also has a 'New Third Board' which basically has no earnings requirement. The board commenced last year and it is now very popular among issuers and investors in China," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong also supports recent calls by some lawmakers for the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> to relax crowdfunding rules to help companies raise funds through such platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States and Britain have modified their laws recently to allow online crowdfunding, a modern version of pooled investment that lets hundreds of people come together to support newly established companies seeking to develop new products or services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But crowdfunding is banned in Hong Kong without SFC authorisation, which the commission has yet to give.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At a Legislative Council meeting last month, some lawmakers urged the SFC to relax the crowdfunding regulation to help technology firms raise funds. Tong said he strongly supported such calls. "I think as long as the investor has agreed to take the risks and acknowledge it in a document, he should be allowed to conduct the investment," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said a steering group to study how to develop Hong Kong into a technology financing hub would be set up soon and it would also study issues related to crowdfunding. "We have been monitoring the development of crowdfunding activities in Hong Kong," Chan said. "However, we are also aware of the potential risks involved in crowdfunding activities."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said the </span><span class="s3">International Organisation of Securities Commissions</span><span class="s1"> had released a study in February last year which showed there was a 50 per cent chance a crowdfunded start-up would default in its first five years of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Fund Association</span><span class="s1"> chairman Bruno Lee said the city's fund houses were willing to invest in smaller technology firms but many would not be interested in newly set-up firms. Lee said the GEM could be a good platform for established technology firms to raise funds for further expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The GEM could not work more like </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, because the US market is different from Hong Kong," he said. "In the US, technology firms also grow to a certain size before they list on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, but then the US has many funds or other fundraising measures for newly set-up technology firms to get the first bucket of gold to develop the first steps of their business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In Hong Kong, however, we do not have many incubators to help technology companies set up from scratch. If the government really wants Hong Kong to become a technology hub, it would need to directly finance these companies to set up before they could list on the GEM or the main board for further expansion."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mike Wong, chief executive of the Chamber of Listed Companies of Hong Kong, said the GEM could reposition itself as a listing venue for new technology firms by allowing firms to list with dual-share shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange lost the listing of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to the US in September after it declined to give it an exemption for a structure that would have allowed its founders and key executives to nominate a majority of the board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange is consulting the market on whether the city should amend its ban on dual-share structures. The SFC listed key conditions for any change last month, including added protection for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The GEM is now considered just a stepping stone for those firms which have not yet qualified to list on the main board. This is not that attractive," Wong said. "The dual-share structure consultation would be a good time to consult the market on repositioning the GEM as a special listing venue for high-growth technology firms to list with special shareholding structures."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher on Monday, ending April on positive note, but analysts were cautious about the market outlook in May, as rising US rates could spark faster-than-expected capital outflows and US-China trade uncertainty could hurt tech stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index advanced 1.7 per cent, or 527.78 points to close at 30,808.45. For April, the index rose 2.4 per cent, snapping a two-month losing streak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, known as the H-share index, rose 2.2 per cent, or 264.81 points, to 12,331.39. It logged a monthly gain of 2.8 per cent in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board's daily turnover decreased 4 per cent to HK$93.6 billion from the previous trading session. The Hong Kong market will be closed on Tuesday for Labour Day and reopen on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland markets were shut on Monday and will also resume trading on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Rising US treasury yields and the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions will continue to keep the market under pressure,” said Ben Kwong, executive director for KGI Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher US treasury yields will trigger capital outflows from Hong Kong and push up interest rates, which will hurt equities, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tony Ho, director of research for China Goldjoy Securities, suggested caution on trading next month, as the trade dispute between the US and China spreads to the tech sector, which could strengthen the odds of “sell in May and go away” and sink tech shares, which drove Hong Kong markets last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Ho said MSCI's scheduled inclusion of A shares in June could spark capital inflows to the Chinese stocks before hand and potentially reignite the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, financial and tech shares both shone. </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced 1 per cent to HK$77.55, after its spin-off health care service app Ping An Good Doctor priced its closely-watched IPO at the top end, raising US$1.1 billion in Hong Kong's biggest offering so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> jumped 3 per cent to HK$8.32, and Bank of China climbed 2.4 per cent to HK$4.30, after China extended the grace period before it imposes new strict regulations on the country's US$15 trillion asset management industry to the end of 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> gained 0.7 per cent to HK$391.00, and </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">improved by 3.7 per cent to HK$130.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Lots of IPOs are coming to Hong Kong and more Korean peninsula peace talks are on the horizon, boosting stocks such as Tencent,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi rose 0.9 per cent to end at 2,515.38. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the world's fifth-largest smartphone manufacturer, is also looking to jump onto the Hong Kong IPO bandwagon, seeking to raise at least US$10 billion, according to Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange announced last week details of its highly-anticipated new listing rules, allowing companies with dual-class share structure and biotech firms that have yet to make profits to list here.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong generally lags behind in global trends. Economically, socially and legally, we're living in the past. By how much is difficult to gauge, but, by some measures, it could be as much as a decade. If we don't start catching up, we're going to suffer big time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The loss of the US$25 billion Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] stock listing to New York was a prime and costly example of how stuck in our ways we can be.

Beyond big business, consider how the refusal to adopt European standards on air quality is affecting health and reputation, how the well-being of workers and their families is undermined by a lack of standard working hours and what a substandard pension scheme means for livelihoods. And we're not even talking about issues like gay marriage and marijuana that are being legalised elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But let's move onto online shopping, an area that smartphone-loving Hongkongers should have embraced. Getting up-to-date statistics is difficult, but a Consumer Council study[https://www.consumer.org.hk/ws_en/competition_issues/reports/2016/online-retail.html#_ftn1] from last year comparing figures for 2014 gives a good perspective. That year, 23 per cent of internet-using Hongkongers had shopped online in the previous 12 months, compared to 67 per cent of mainland Chinese, 69 per cent of Japanese, 73 per cent of Germans, 78 per cent of Americans and 81 per cent of Britons.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's compact size and shop-packed streets may be behind the low take-up. But I've a feeling much of it is to do with not trusting online sellers.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My sons long ago realised that, feeding their gym-rat lifestyles with supplements, equipment and clothing.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The same is happening in Europe, Canada and Australia; it's inevitable when stores don't respond quickly enough to customer demands on price, selection and fashion. And if the experience of my sons and their 20- and 30-something friends is any guide, it's going to hit Hong Kong sooner rather than later. The impact to our economy won't be huge as, by various estimates, the retail sector accounts for only between 1.3 and 3.9 per cent of gross domestic product. But with the Hong Kong Retail Management Association claiming that about 10 per cent of our city's workers, or 260,000 people, are employed in the sector, there could be a huge impact on the labour force.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is mulling reforms to grab a share of the US$40 billion of potential stock offerings from Chinese technology firms seeking to relist from the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx will on Friday announce the result of a consultation on a dual-share structure reform. Chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Thursday: "We are going to have some news on this reform soon." He did not elaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also confirmed a South China Morning Post report that the HKEx board had approved two reforms - a braking mechanism to check stock volatility and an auction system for closing share prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the details would be announced next month and both measures would come into force in the second half of next year to give the market time to prepare.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules do not allow dual-share structures - which give the promoters of a company greater say despite being minority stake holders - that many technology firms seek. After trying to list in Hong Kong, e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted last year to list in the US, where dual-share structures are permitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There has been a lot of debate over the Alibaba listing, resulting in the consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are a number of Chinese technology companies listed in the US that are now considering coming back to list in the domestic markets. This is because the A-share market is getting bigger and has high liquidity," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This delisting trend in the US would provide huge opportunities for mainland [Chinese] and Hong Kong markets. It provides both opportunities and challenges to the HKEx. We would need to make sure Hong Kong is attractive enough for these companies to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of the end of May last year, a third of the 102 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures, with 70 per cent of them being IT firms. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of the firms that listed between January 2010 and December 2013 were IT firms, according to the HKEx.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts estimate the market capitalisation of US-listed Chinesecompanies could amount to US$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August last year, the HKEx launched a consultation on whether it should allow dual-share structures and received a mixed response. While supporters believe a change in rules is necessary to attract listings, others worry it would affect the standard of investor protection in the local market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far this year, seven overseas-listed Chinese firms, including </span><span class="s3">Qihoo 360 Technology</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Sungy Mobile</span><span class="s1"> and WX Pharma, have gone private and are expected to relist in the mainland market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The State Council and regulatory bodies have publicly voiced support for fast-track domestic listing of US-listed enterprises. Qianhai, in Shenzhen, has already expressed its interest in building an "offshore exchange" to allow overseas companies to list or dually list in the new economic zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas Chinese internet stocks are trading at a much lower price-earnings multiple than their counterparts at home.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the operator of the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong, is likely to report a 27 per cent jump in profit for 2017 on Wednesday on the back of higher stock market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The exchange is widely expected to have strong profit growth in 2017 as the market turnover is so strong,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for financial services and a broker. “The </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has also started to generate higher revenue and the number of new listings is also getting higher, which should boost the profitability of the HKEX up by about 30 per cent from last year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily turnover in 2017 stood at HK$88.2 billion, up 32 per cent from HK$66.9 billion in 2016. The exchange earns its income from trading fee paid by investors on each stock transaction, which means a higher turnover results in higher income.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee was another major income source for the exchange in 2017 as a record 174 companies launched initial public offerings. However, since there were no blockbuster IPOs the total funds raised dropped 34 per cent to HK$128.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange last Friday announced that it would bring forward the listing reform from June to late April when it will start accepting IPO applications from biotech companies without revenue or giant new economy companies with dual class share structure to list in Hong Kong. The reform will also allow large companies now listed in the US and the UK to apply for secondary listings in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Citi Research report, led by analyst Darwin Lam, said it expected such companies to start applying for listings in Hong Kong from May, which would boost the outlook of HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bourse operator unveils multifunctional HKEX Connect Hall at site of trading hall[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2133901/hang-seng-index-makes-red-debut-first-year-dog-trading-day]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We reiterate our view that the listing regime changes are a milestone for the Hong Kong stock market, which should help strengthen HKEX's listing hub status,” Lam said in the report after the exchange's announcement on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He has a“buy” rating on the HKEX and a target price at HK$330. The stock closed at HK$285.8 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank CICC was even more bullish giving the HKEX stock a target price of HK$400 as it believes stronger-than-expected market turnover was likely to continue this year and next.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Average daily turnover in January reached HK160 billion, up 181 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the driving forces for the rising turnover was the southbound flow from Chinese investors via the two stock connect between mainland exchanges and Hong Kong, which represented almost 10 per cent of daily turnover on some days last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A proposal by Hong Kong and mainland China's stock exchanges to let investors partake in initial public offerings in each other's markets has been given an added impetus by the prospect of attracting the US$2 trillion </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is one of several global equity bourses including New York, London, Tokyo, Toronto and Singapore contending to be the staging ground for Aramco's IPO, estimated to be US$100 billion in size. The proposal, known as the “Primary Equity Connect,” would let investors from China's US$7.6 trillion capital market gain access to the Aramco IPO through Hong Kong, increasing the city's attractiveness as a place for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From China's side, Aramco listing in Hong Kong can also provide a “natural hedge” for domestic investors against the oil price volatility, said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the exchange operator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The “primary equity connect” and the Aramco listing in Hong Kong can be a successful combination, as both sides are able to benefit from it, Li said during a conference in the city. “It's a win-win situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li didn't specify on the timetable of the launch of primary equity connect, but said the exchange has been in talks with relevant parties. “We never stop (the talks),” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Li said in his blog that the “Primary Equity Connect” is feasible from a technical perspective, but important work remains for regulators to iron out the right regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The connect plan is the latest piece of a process of fostering closer integration between Hong Kong's equity market with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has launched three of the so-called connect schemes since 2014 with Chinese markets to facilitate cross-border trading. These comprised the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016, and the Bond Connect in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read: What is the Bond Connect?[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2101077/explainer-what-bond-connect]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco, owned and run by the government of Saudi Arabia, plans to sell up to 5 per cent of the oil company in a 2018 IPO in one or more international markets beyond the stock exchange in Riyadh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even listing only 5 per cent of the US$2 trillion company would lead to a US$100 billion IPO, the biggest ever in world history, and leagues ahead of Alibaba's record US$25 billion flotation in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, Li also said the HKEX has finished the consultation on a new trading board and the conclusion could “hopefully” come out in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX started a public consultation in June for establishing a so-called “third board”, after the current board and Growth Enterprise Market, aiming to lure more new economy listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board could allow companies ranging from internet start-ups to biotech firms with dual-class share structures to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX has received positive feedbacks about establishing the “third board”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange might launch a second round of consultation on details about listing rules, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to find new ways to lure new economy companies to stay competitive,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX proposed in 2015 to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February, Singapore's stock exchange started a public consultation on introducing a dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted to list in New York as its corporate governance structure was refused in Hong Kong. It triggered a hot debate in Hong Kong on dual-class shares and how to balance the interests of founding shareholders and executives with investors'.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrail Group, one of China's largest dental services providers, faces a dilemma on whether to list shares in Hong Kong or New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the eyes of founder and chairman Robert Zou Qifang, Hong Kong's geographical and cultural proximity to the mainland is a clear advantage, but the ban on dual-class shares structure for non-technology firms listed in the city is a major stumbling block.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong's biggest advantage is its proximity and good investor understanding of the mainland market,” he told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The United States' financial market is more mature where investors have a better understanding of growth industries.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After raising US$200 million via four rounds of private share placements since 2010, Zou believes the company is almost ready to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company operates 10 dental clinics in Beijing, and 91 in total across the country, employing 645 dentists. About 30 additional dental clinics are planned to open this year. Zou says he has a target of 1,000 clinics nationwide within the next eight years. The expansion will require 5 billion yuan (US$774.04 million) over seven years to 2025.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It would be partly funded by partnering with senior dentists working at its clinics, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> last month said it plans to allow technology and “new economy” firms with over HK$10 billion of market value to list with multiple classes of shares carrying different voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change was aimed at attracting more jumbo listings to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zou said given its high-growth nature in an emerging industry, Arrail would try to convince HKEx to let it list while keeping its dual-share structure, adding it was already close to the HK$10 billion threshold after last year's private share sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As high growth firms typically require multiple share placements that severely dilute the original owners' holdings, a dual class shares structure is essential for maintaining our vision and direction,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arrail has yet to engaged in talks with HKEx on the matter. Should an agreement fail to materialise, Zou said he would bypass Hong Kong in favour of New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zou expects China's dental service market to grow to 1 trillion yuan by 2030, reflecting an annual growth rate of 19 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's direct oral health care spending per capita was US$9 in 2016, compared to the global average of US$43.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial industry professionals are still divided over how they can remake the city's stock exchange to make it the world's most attractive place for startups and technology firms to raise capital, even as the first round of a public consultation process drew to a close on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited</span><span class="s1">, the operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation and overseer of the consultation, has proposed the establishment of a third board to provide a listing avenue for companies with dual share structures, as well as those with no profit track record. Accountants, bankers, brokers and lawyers are divided over whether a third board is needed, in addition to the existing main board and the growth enterprises market (GEM) for startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/18/da1bea5a-83ee-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_163241.JPG]"We received a lot of comments already, and we expect to receive more," said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited, the bourse operator overseeing the process. "If the market supports, we will have another round of consultation of detail regulations. If all would gain support, I would hope to see the new board to start in the first half of next year," said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, at the exchange result briefing last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake is how Hong Kong can make its bourse attractive enough as a fund-raising destination in competition with New York, Shanghai or Singapore and other global markets, especially for startups and so-called new economy companies in financial technology, e-commerce and biotechnology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies raised US$5.8 billion in Hong Kong through initial public offerings during the first six months of this year, a decline of 19.5 per cent compared with the same period in 2016, when the city was top of the league table for new listings worldwide, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The companies that raised funds in the city were dominated by the financial industry, accounting for 59 per cent of funds raised during the period, while technology companies raised the equivalent of 0.8 per cent, the data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/18/20bd598a-83ef-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_163241.JPG]The loss of appeal to technology was the factor that unseated Hong Kong from the top of last year's league to third place. New York took the crown in the first half, with companies including Snap Inc raising a combined US$18.2 billion. Shanghai was the second largest, with US$9.6 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further illustrating Hong Kong's lack of appeal to new-economy companies, the Shanghai Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange, or Lufax, obtained a license to operate its financial technology business in Singapore, instead of Hong Kong, a stone's throw from the base of its parent Ping An Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed third board will comprise two parts. One is a so-called premium market open to all investors, hosting companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but with a dual-class share structure currently disallowed on the main bourse. The second is the so-called pro market focused on startups where only professional investors with higher appetite -- and understanding -- of risks are allowed to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposals are taking the wrong direction entirely to improve Hong Kong's markets," said David Webb, founder of the activist shareholders' platform Webb-site and former HKEX director. Hong Kong doesn't need a new board, and he favours "a single board, under a single statutory regulator, combining listing and takeover regulation, and not the four-board mess that HKEX advocates," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stockbroker community support the new board, provided it has enough protections for shareholders, said Benny Mau, chairman of the city's Securities Association, an industry guild.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the industry watchdog agency, said it's open minded, either way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC keeps an open mind to listen to what the market says about the new board," the agency's chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said in response to inquiry by the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of Agile Property Holdings was arrested on suspicion of indecently assaulting a 28-year-old female employee at his luxury house in Happy Valley, the company said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Agile stressed the incident "has not and will not affect the normal business and operations of the" Hong Kong-listed firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Zhuolin, 50, was arrested on Thursday when he went to Wan Chai police station to answer inquiries over an alleged indecent assault at his home on Purves Road on July 10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the group's share price closed 4.61 per cent lower at HK$8.90 yesterday, analysts said Chen's arrest was unlikely to affect the group's ventures - especially its plan to bid for more land plots in Yunnan .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a police officer, the assault took place shortly before midnight on July 10 when Chen and the alleged victim held a reception for mainland clients at his house. After the clients left, she was asked to stay and sing karaoke with him. "The victim claimed she was molested while singing in a karaoke room and she was also taken to a bedroom where she was indecently assaulted," the police source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the victim did not report the attack that night. She discussed the alleged incident with colleagues before she went to Happy Valley police station and reported the case on July 14.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen was granted police bail but is required to report back next month. No charge has been laid.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the family trust of Chen and his wife, Fion Luk Sin-fong, owned a 63.58 per cent stake in the company, analysts believe the incident is unlikely to lead to any big change in the companies' share structure or its ambition to develop tourism-related real estate on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The company has been listed for so long I don't believe any private conflict between Chen and his wife could alter the company's future direction," said an analyst from a Japan-based securities firm. But he expects the company's share price to be under pressure in the near future, as some fund managers are required to avoid investing in companies whose senior executives are under criminal investigation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen and his wife co-founded the company 20 years ago. Agile Garden in Zhongshan , one of its early key projects, was a big hit and once made up 70 per cent of the city's total property sales. The company entered the Guangzhou market in 2002 and set a record by launching four property developments in one year. The company went public in Hong Kong in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Forbes ranked Chen and his family in 75th place on a list of China's 400 richest, with wealth of US$1.34 billion. In July, a local rich list published by Money Week magazine named Chen and his family the ninth richest in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has paved the way for a listing in the United States, with a spokesman for the mainland e-commerce giant saying yesterday that both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq had accepted its special partnership structure, which would let its top executives nominate the majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two bourses had formally accepted Alibaba's partnership structure, which derailed its initial public offering (IPO) plan in Hong Kong, the spokesman said, adding: "We just want other people to understand the partnership structure is an open, innovative, responsible and sustainable system for a company's fundamental needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Alibaba spokesman said last night that the company had not yet selected an exchange or appointed underwriters for a US listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong regulators had said there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's a pity that Hong Kong lost out on this iconic internet giant being listed in the city, but the Hong Kong stock exchange, as a regulator as well, had to safeguard the interests of minority shareholders," said Linus Yip Sheung-chi, strategist at First Shanghai Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rebuff by the Securities and Futures Commission and the exchange resulted in a war of words between the two camps.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai said last month that Hong Kong had to consider what was needed in order to adapt to future trends or risk becoming content to look on as the rest of the world passed it by.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-Keung told a Legislative Council meeting this month that the exchange had no plans to consult the market about any changes in its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US is one of the few markets that allow a dual-class share structure, which means different shareholders have different rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba could have fetched up to HK$100 billion in a listing, </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1"> said in June. That would have made it Asia's biggest IPO since October 2010, when insurer AIA raised HK$159 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outgoing chairman of the Hong Kong stock market operator said his biggest regret during his six-year tenure was the failure to land the initial public share offering in 2014 of Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow Chung-kong, who stepped down as chairman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, said he hoped that reforms to listing rules announced this week would bring big tech firms like Alibaba to the city's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba is a good company. It was a regret during my term to see HKEX lose Alibaba. I hope the listing reform announced on Tuesday will bring eight or 10 companies like Alibaba to list in Hong Kong,” Chow said at his last media briefing after the AGM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba decided to list in the US rather than Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted under rules at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was met with disappointment in Hong Kong and was the spark for the debate over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what it billed as the biggest listing reform to the exchange in 25 years, HKEX said on Tuesday that from next week it would allow companies with dual-class share structures to list. Such structures are favoured by many tech firms because they allow founders and key managers to keep control even if they hold only minority stakes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said that he would count the listing reform as among his three major achievements, alongside HKEX's takeover of the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2012 and the setting up of the two Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges that allowed cross-border trading of Hong Kong and mainland China equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKEX has developed from a local stock market to a global exchange with multiple asset classes,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed on Wednesday at 30,328.15, up more than 30 per cent from the 20,677.16 when Chow took office on April 24, 2012. Its market capitalisation has also risen more than 70 per cent in the period to over HK$34 trillion (US$4.3 trillion). Market turnover in the first quarter of this year stood at HK$146.1 billion, compared with average daily turnover of HK$53.9 billion in 2012.</span></p>

The Financial Services Development Council's chairwoman, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, a former vice-chair of market regulator the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, is widely expected to succeed Chow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What I can say is the overall outlook is positive for the new chairman. As China is going to become the world's largest economy, it will need a world class financial centre and Hong Kong has the conditions to play such a role,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future, the California-based electric car start-up founded by Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting, said on Monday that its largest shareholder </span><span class="s3">Evergrande Health Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> had deliberately withheld promised payments and prevented it from seeking alternative financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The development comes after Evergrande accused FF of trying to scrap the original stake sale deal after spending the initial investment of US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande Health, a unit of the Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group, announced in June that it would buy a 45 per cent stake in FF for a total investment of US$2 billion, as part of the group's diversification plan into the hi-tech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the deal, Evergrande fully acquired Season Smart, which owns 45 per cent of the joint venture that controls FF - Smart King. Through Season Smart, Evergrande has already made an initial investment of US$800 million in FF. It also agreed to pay another US$1.2 billion in two equal instalments in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Evergrande said the EV start-up had started assembling its first high-end car, FF91, at its US production base. FF also set up an operating headquarters in China for research and development and production in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, in an exchange filing on Sunday night, Evergrande said FF demanded another US$700 million in July after spending the initial investment of US$800 million, following which it signed another agreement with the start-up to pay this US$700 million under certain “payment conditions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While “the payment conditions had not been fulfilled”, Jia “manipulated” his majority board seat position to begin an arbitration against Evergrande at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre on October 3, 2018, the filing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jia was seeking to deprive Season Smart of its shareholder right to approve any future financing plan, while also trying to terminate all the other agreements with Evergrande, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said that it has already fulfilled its obligations under the relevant agreements and that the arbitration has “severely damaged” their rights and interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Season Smart has engaged a team of international lawyers and will take all necessary actions to protect Season Smart's continuing rights under the relevant agreements, and to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF responded on Monday afternoon denying the accusations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Contrary to what has been reported, Evergrande failed to make any of the promised additional payments beyond the original US$800 million, despite FF and its CEO complying with their obligations and meeting all required conditions for funding under the July 2018 agreement,” FF said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Instead, Evergrande held the payments back to try to gain control and ownership over FF China and all of FF's intellectual property. At the same time, Evergrande is preventing FF from accepting any immediate financing from other sources.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF denied either Jia or anyone else had “manipulated” the board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up said Evergrande had a full understanding of why and when FF needed the additional US$700 million, which is to achieve production and delivery of FF91 in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the only reason ‘FF is trying to get out of the deal with Evergrande' is because Evergrande has failed to live up to its end of the bargain and make the payments it agreed to make … Evergrande shouldn't be permitted to withhold the funding and simultaneously prevent FF from accepting alternative financing or investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF added it will continue to take actions, including pursuing other funding opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in Evergrande Health briefly skidded 37 per cent at Monday's open, before paring losses to 16.4 per cent, to close at HK$8.78. Evergrande Group also lost 6.3 per cent to end at HK$20.95.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Evergrande Health has gained 90 per cent from the level before the June announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future is considered key to Evergrande Group's electric car ambition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hui Kayan, chairman of Evergrande Group, said in April the group plans to invest 100 billion yuan (US$14.5 billion) in the next 10 years in a wide range of hi-tech sectors like life sciences, AI, robotics, and alternative energy. Electric cars are an important part of the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said in August that Faraday Future aims to reach an annual production capacity of 5 million vehicles by 2028. The Chinese unit of Faraday Future has already been set up in Guangzhou city, with a registered capital of US$2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, Evergrande Group invested 14.5 billion yuan for a 41 per cent stake in Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment Group, one of China's largest car dealers. The investment has been regarded as an effort by Evergrande to pave the way for Faraday Future's car sales network in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Evergrande Health became the largest shareholder of the joint venture, it has less voting right than Jia because of the dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on the June agreement, each share Evergrande Health owns equals one vote compared to 10 votes for each share held by Jia. Consequently, Evergrande Health only has 12 per cent of the voting right. Jia, who owns 33 per cent of the company, controls the rest of the voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the agreement has a special clause, which stipulates that if the management is unable to perform its duties, Jia's voting rights will be reversed to Season Smart. It would result in a full control of Faraday Future by Evergrande Health.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future was founded in 2014 by Jia, chairman and CEO of the debt-saddled technology conglomerate LeEco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Jia defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to China and said he needed to stay in the US to focus on Faraday Future. He said his brother and wife had been empowered to handle matters relevant to the company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks rose the most in three years on Monday, boosted by gains in Chinese financials amid expectations Beijing would slow down its deleveraging campaign if trade tensions with the United States affect the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 2.5 per cent, or 67.88 points, to 2,815.11, while the CSI 300 Index, which tracks large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose by 2.8 per cent, or 94.06 points, to 3,459.18. The increases recorded by both indexes were their biggest since May 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose by 1.3 per cent, or 372.88 points, to 28,688.50, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed by 1.4 per cent, or 145.73 points, to 10,768.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock market rebound came from a very sharp previous drop, and the US not hitting back at China with even bigger tariffs over the weekend,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “The key resistance level for the [Hang Seng] benchmark index will be in a range of between 29,000 and 29,500.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, signs pointed to the US taking a softer stance towards China, with Washington taking a break from further escalating its trade war with Beijing after both countries fired their first salvoes last week, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">office of the US Trade Representative</span><span class="s1"> announced an exclusion process for Chinese products subject to Section 301 tariffs, seeking to lessen the blow for US companies. And judging by China's retaliatory tariffs on a range of US agricultural goods so far, the mainland seemed to be avoiding an escalation in trade tensions too, said analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced by 1.8 per cent to HK$70.95, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2 per cent to HK$6.94 and the </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> gained by 1.5 per cent to HK$5.61.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And while smartphone maker Xiaomi, the first company with a dual-class share structure to list in Hong Kong, closed 1.2 per cent below its listing price, at HK$16.80, on its trading debut, technology related companies fared well. Internet giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2.4 per cent to HK$396, </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">rose by 2.2 per cent to HK$145.1 and </span><span class="s3">AAC Technologies Holdings</span><span class="s1"> was 1.1 per cent higher at HK$107.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts widely expect the US to impose tariffs on US$50 billion worth of imports from China; and in a bearish scenario, there is a risk the duties could expand to hit a further US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods.The key resistance level for the benchmark index will be in a range of between 29,000 and 29,500Linus Yip, First Shanghai Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As international trade conflicts flare and cause significant stress to the Chinese and global economy, domestic policy easing is likely to step up and offset the pain, according to Helen Qiao, China and Asia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A set of Chinese growth data to be released this week is expected to be a critical test for the local markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, the Shenzhen Composite Index rose by 2.5 per cent, or 38.56 points, to 1,574.54, while the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">-style ChiNext rose by 2.5 per cent, or 38.56 points, to 1,574.54.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Asian markets also rose on Monday. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained by 1.1 per cent, or 264.04 points, to 22,052.18. South Korea's Kospi was up by 0.6 per cent and Australia's All Ordinaries Index edged up 0.2 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may amend its listing rules to accept companies with dual class shares and biotech companies with no revenue as early as late April, accelerating the timeline for the widely-expected listing regime change by several months, the bourse operator said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January predicted the listing rules could be amended from June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We bring the reform forward to late April as it would allow the listing of these companies in the summer period when June to August are active months,” Li said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have discussed this reform for a long time and a lot of issues have consensus already. We do not need the normal two months of consultation and could speed the process up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange on Friday issued a consultation paper detailing the proposed rule changes that will enable some companies with multiple-class share structures to list on the Hong Kong stock market, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation will last for one month, officially drawing to a close on March 23, while the consultation conclusion would be made in late April, officials said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Upon the issuance of the consultation conclusion and the implementation of the listing rules, the exchange will accept formal applications under the new regime,” the exchange said. Companies are welcome to make informal inquiries to the exchange ahead of the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few months we have collectively decided to take a big step forwards as a financial centre and welcome emerging and innovative companies. Now we are proposing a listing regime that will boost Hong Kong's attractiveness for a new generation of companies as well as investors, bringing more dynamism to our stock market,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said he supported the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The proposals are reasonable and can offer shareholder protection. It is particularly important that biotech companies must not change their principal business without prior approval by the exchange,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the HKEX, following an industry consultation, decided to proceed with reforms to allow dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, as long as the companies have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$10 billion (US$1.29 billion) and annual revenue of HK$1 billion. Companies that have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion would be exempt from the revenue requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our new secondary listing regime welcome both Chinese and international companies to apply,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies already listed under the dual-class share structure such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> or Baidu in the US, could apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong while maintaining their current structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If their share trading volume exceeds 55 per cent in Hong Kong, they could be classed as a dual primary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech companies taking advantage of the new listing regime would need to have a minimum market cap of HK$1.5 billion and be limited to sophisticated investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the exchange did not accept calls made by some fund managers for a sunset clause that would see the dual class structure expire after a period of years, or undergo a general vote by shareholders for renewal. The exchange said the rule would be too restrictive and prompt companies to look towards other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A sunset clause with an expiry date would create uncertainty for both companies and investors. It would be difficult for the companies to have long term development,” Li said. “It is also hard to determine what time frame would be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among safeguards to protect minority investors, some shareholder votes would be conducted on the basis of one share one vote.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the local bourse operator, is expected to post 11 per cent net profit growth for the first half of 2017 as a result of better market turnover and higher volume of derivative trading, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is expected to report on Wednesday that its second quarter net profit grew 3 per cent to HK$1.6 billion, or HK$1.34 per share, according to consensus of analysts polled by Bloomberg. They expected revenue for the quarter would be up 7 per cent to HK$3.09 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Add the already announced first quarter net profit of HK$1.72 billion and the bourse operator's first half profit is expected to reach HK$3.32 billion, up 11 per cent from HK$2.99 billion in the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First half revenue is expected to grow 10.98 per cent to HK$6.248 billion, up from HK$5.6 billion in the first half of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the first half of 2017 the average daily turnover was HK$76 billion which is up 12.6 per cent year on year from the first half of 2016. The higher market turnover brought in better fee income which contributes to the profit for HKEX," said Kenny Wen, a wealth management strategist at </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The volume of derivative products trading also reach a record high level in the first half of this year which also brought in higher fee income," Wen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time for Hong Kong to define the ‘new economy' amid talk of third board at stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2105149/time-hong-kong-define-new-economy-amid-talk-third-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX earns fee income from investors on stock and derivatives products trading as well as from listing fees paid by listed companies. It also earn fee income from commodities trading from its wholly owned subsidiary </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which is the world's largest metal exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds raised through initial public offerings in the first half totalled HK$53.6 billion, an increase of 23 per cent when compared with HK$43.6 billion for the same period last year. In terms of numbers, there were 72 newly listed companies in the first half, up 80 per cent when compared with 40 for the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific, said the higher number of new listings and the stock connect programmes have brought in higher revenue to the exchange.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since the launch of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect from December and the removal of the total quota for the stock connect scheme, we have seen more fund flows from mainlanders buying Hong Kong stocks in the first half. Mainlanders now account for about 10 per cent of all turnover of the Hong Kong stock market which boosts fee income for the exchange," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsui said the launch of bond connect on July 3 and the two new gold futures contracts on July 10 would bring in more revenue to the exchange in the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter the exchange already reported a better than expected 20 per cent growth in its net profit to HK$1.72 billion, which was boosted by a one-off HK$55 million interest payment from the liquidation of </span><span class="s3">Lehman Brothers</span><span class="s1">. Excluding that, it still reported profit growth of 16 per cent to HK$1.67 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will host a briefing on Wednesday to discuss the results. The market will also be keen to learn more about the progress of the new third board planned for next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange is seeking consultations until August 18 on a proposal to introduce a new board to attract more technology companies to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board would consist of two markets. The first is a premium market open to all investors, hosting companies that meet the eligibility requirements for a main board listing but which have a dual-class share structure currently banned on the main exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second market will be focused on start-ups and would be limited solely to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange is also keen on convincing </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list in Hong Kong, expected to be the largest initial public offering worldwide, raising US$100 billion. Markets expect the Saudi Arabia oil company to sell 5 per cent of the firm, valuing the business at US$2 trillion. New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo are in the race to capture the listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah Mobile, the fast-growing security software business of Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft, plans to raise about US$300 million in its initial public offering in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Cheetah, formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software, intends to list its shares on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, according to its filing on Wednesday with the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said the net proceeds from the share offering would mainly be used to strengthen its research and development, sales and marketing, and international expansion efforts. It did not provide the number of shares to be sold or the price range of the offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Established in 2009, Cheetah provides free-to-download applications that include mobile security software Clean Master and mobile power booster Battery Doctor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CCB International said in a report last month that those popular apps offered plenty of commercial opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah posted a net profit of 62 million yuan (HK$78 million) on revenue of 750 million yuan last year. Under its business model, the firm mainly generates revenue from its more than 380 online marketing partners, the biggest of which are Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a separate filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday, Kingsoft estimated that its 54.09 per cent shareholding in Cheetah will be diluted to about 47 per cent after the spin-off is completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah has proposed adopting a dual-class share capital structure that would allow Kingsoft to retain control and continue to consolidate the unit's financial results after the IPO. This type of share structure is not available in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a company with less than US$1 billion in revenue in its last financial year, Cheetah also qualifies as an "emerging growth company" under US law, meaning it can take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi staged a dramatic turnaround on its second day of trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's market capitalisation surged to HK$425 billion (US$54.2 billion), breaking into Hong Kong's top 10 companies, after the stock was added to widely tracked the FTSE China A50 Index, and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect schemes as soon as this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure quickly rebounded on Tuesday to as much as HK$19.34. It closed at HK$19. On its debut on Monday, it fell 1.2 per cent below the offer price of HK$17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The turnaround was quite surprising as it was just the second day of trading and the fundamental has not changed at all,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “It's mainly due to short-term capital inflows, after it was added to FTSE and HSCI indexes, prompting some funds to chase it before the additions take effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yip said the FTSE China A50 Index is tracked by many passive ETFs, which means they will have to rebalance their portfolios to accommodate the change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share surge has helped Xiaomi break into Hong Kong's top 10 most valuable listed companies, a league that includes </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, AIA, and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">. Xiaomi ranks No 9 at its current market cap, ahead of </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading volumes also soared, with more than HK$9.8 billion worth of shares changing hands on Tuesday, 27 per cent higher than the HK$7.7 billion on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change in fortunes came after index compiler FTSE Russell announced that it would include Xiaomi in a number of its indexes with effect from July 16, including FTSE China A50 Index, which is tracked by nearly US$7 billion worth of funds globally. Consequently, it will remove US sanctions-hit ZTE from the FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday afternoon, the Hang Seng Indexes Company also said that it would add Xiaomi to the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) with effect from July 23. The HSCI family has more than 400 constituents, covering over 90 per cent of Hong Kong stock exchange's market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a constituent of the HSCI, mainland investors will be able to buy Xiaomi shares via the Stock Connect programme, provided Chinese authorities grant approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macquarie, which issued a research report on Monday, set Xiaomi's target price at HK$30, as it expects the company's earnings per share to post a compound annual growth rate of 40 per cent between 2018 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank's analysts said Xiaomi can monetise its large number of active users via various internet services, such as online games, apps, ads, which could be its biggest strength compared to its peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company can benefit from rising profit margins in internet services business for the next three years and its continued smartphone sales growth in India, Europe, and Chinese markets, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi has 190 million monthly active users for its mobile operating platform, according to the company's founder and CEO Lei Jun.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi fell below its offer price on Monday, after its much-anticipated IPO received a lukewarm response amid a weak market, as the company's categorisation of “internet firm” and valuation sparked a close examination by investors and regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Index compiler MSCI said last week it will not add Xiaomi to its benchmark index because the company does not meet the criteria due to its weighted voting rights (WVR) structure. WVR, also called dual-class shares, allows a company's founders or executives to have control even if they have minority shareholding.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has failed to secure a spot in the top 10 league table for funds raised from IPOs of technology companies worldwide, which surged three times to US$18.87 billion in the first eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong's main board only ranked at the world's 12th largest market in terms of IPO funds raised by technology companies, while the second board Growth Enterprise Market ranked 19th.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This marks a contrast to the ranking for the world's largest IPO market, where Hong Kong's main board is placed fourth as its strength lies in drawing financial firms to list, but not technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Hong Kong has seen improvement this year. So far, three technology firm IPOs have raised a combined US$424.1 million this year, which is 30 times higher than the same period last year when one firm raised US$14.8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increase is largely attributed to the IPO of FIT Hon Teng, a subsidiary of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and maker of connectors for Apple's iPhones that raised US$393.58 million in June. It was also the world's eighth largest technology firm IPO this year.</span></p>

The volume is substantially lower than the New York Stock Exchange, the top technology IPO centre, where four technology firm IPOs to date have raised US$4.56 billion, accounting for 24.2 per cent of global funds raised, the Thomson Reuters data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Swiss Stock Exchange ranked second and South Korean ranked third, while Shenzhen ChiNext ranked fourth, and Singapore was fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other markets,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the city's financial services sector.Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other marketsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has been a worldwide trend that there are more and more new economy and technology companies seeking for listings. They are the future driving force of the worldwide economy. If our market could not capture these companies to list, we would lag behind,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has just completed a consultation to set up a third board to attract more technology companies to list, but it would still need a second round of consultation for the detailed rules. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wants the new board to be launched in the first half of 2018, but he will have to convince all stakeholders to accept the proposals that have received very mixed reactions during the two-month consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have different regulations from the existing main board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has proposed the third board to have two markets: a premium market for companies eligible to list on the main board but with dual-class shareholding structures and open to all investors, and a second market for start-ups and open only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong currently bans dual class shares which are allowed in the US. Dual class shareholding allows founders or key management of the companies to own shares with more voting rights than the others, which large technology firms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> preferred.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the largest technology IPO this year which raised US$3.9 billion on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in March, also has a dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, Francis Leung Pak-to on Monday showed support for a new market for dual class share companies with a market cap of HK$8 billion (US$1 billion) to list, but opposed to a start-up board market as he said the risks of failures of these newly set up companies were too high.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is expected to trade close to the 7.85 weak-side convertibility undertaking through 2019 because of rising volatility in the currency amid a string of initial public offerings and strength in the US dollar, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar traded at 7.8487 per US dollar late afternoon on Monday after previously falling to a low of 7.8499, approaching the threshold for the monetary authority to intervene in the currency markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under its currency board system, the de facto central bank is obliged to buy or sell the Hong Kong dollar to keep it within a range between 7.75 to 7.85 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange points may be more influenced by short term events than before, such as IPOs,” Ronald Man, fixed income and currency emerging Asia strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> said in a recent research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure Xiaomi locked up about HK$23 billion (US$2.9 billion) in subscriptions in June. China Tower, the world's largest operator of transmission towers for mobile phone networks, is also planning to raise as much as HK$68.1 billion in an IPO, the biggest such sale globally in nearly four years. Retail investors can subscribe to the offer from Wednesday until next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But any banking liquidity squeeze is likely to ease once the IPOs are completed. That would widen back the US-Hong Kong interest rate gap, attracting currency traders to sell the Hong Kong dollar for the higher yielding US dollar and exerting pressure on the local currency, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One-month Hibor was at 1.8 per cent on Monday, down 33 basis points from a 10-year high of 2.13 per cent hit on June 25, when it briefly closed its gap with its US Libor counterpart for the first time since 2017. On Wednesday, the gap widened back to 21 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While interest rates on various fixed deposits have risen in the past months, the city's commercial banks in Hong Kong have yet to raise their prime lending rates. The Hibor rate is likely to stay below Libor as liquidity in the city is likely to stay relatively supported, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has been raising benchmark rates in lockstep with the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> since the current tightening cycle got underway in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In interventions in April and May, the monetary authority spent around HK$70 billion to support the Hong Kong dollar, which has tightened the amount of dollars in circulation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, inflows into Hong Kong dollar assets and commercial banks that continue to refrain from raising the prime lending rates have partially offset the liquidity drain, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around the region, markets are poised for more weakness in Asian currencies, including the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar, said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy at </span><span class="s3">United Overseas Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong US growth and rising inflation indicators reinforce the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s gradual rate hiking path, boosting the US dollar and Treasury rates, Heng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">DBS Bank</span><span class="s1"> forecasts three-month Hibor to rise to 3.25 per cent by the end of 2019, up from Wednesday's 2.07 per cent level while three-month Libor was expected to hit 3.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has abandoned plans to sell shares anywhere in the near term in a bid to let the heat die down over its controversial share-structure proposal, chief executive Jonathan Lu Zhaoxi told the South China Morning Post yesterday, leaving the door open to a Hong Kong listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We decided to put down the issue after the last round of discussions," Lu said in an interview at the company's Hangzhou headquarters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong may need some time to understand the creative management structure for a creative company," he added, in a sign that the potential HK$100 billion share deal has not yet been permanently lost to the city in favour of an alternative listing venue. We decided to put down the issue after the last round of discussions JONATHAN LU, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ALIBABA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There appears to be movement on the Hong Kong side too, with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia saying in his blog yesterday that consideration should be given to "non-standard shareholding structures" for "innovative companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his blog on HKEx's website, Li said there were "a wide range of possibilities that could be considered" when deciding whether or not to let innovative firms' founders have extra power to influence the nomination of the majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proponents of the structure have argued that such an arrangement would preserve the long-term vision, ideas and strategies of company founders - many of whom would have seen their interests diluted after rounds of external financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But opponents said this could open the door for the largest shareholders to harm minority shareholders' interests when their interests were not aligned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has been trying to convince Hong Kong regulators to permit a partnership structure allowing its top management to nominate the majority of its board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, stressing that he was expressing his personal views to further the debate, said whether a partnership structure was allowed or not was not core to the issue, because regulators would look through any partnership to the underlying structure and persons involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"You are a shareholder, director, or manager, or all three; whether or not you are a 'partner' is of little relevance," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"What is trickier is how to structure founders' influence on senior management appointments without encroaching on the fundamental power of directors to appoint the leadership on behalf of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We should have a proper debate before making a decision ... we should make the decision proactively."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said greater concessions could be allowed for founders in markets with stronger checks and balances, such as the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In a less institutionalised and less litigious market such as Hong Kong, such concessions, if given, would need to be moderate and come with checks and balances for use in the event of abuse or true conflict," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, listed firms are allowed to have "dual-class" shares, where founding shareholders are allowed extra voting rights on key company matters. In Hong Kong, shareholders have equal rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li suggested that minimum market capitalisation, public float and shareholding requirements for founders should be considered if special rights were given to founding shareholders, "to maintain a healthy counter-balance of power".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He emphasised that he was not representing the view of HKEx's listing committee, which has the primary role in deciding whether to reform current regulations, subject to the oversight of the Securities and Futures Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An SFC spokesman declined to comment yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants said the episode highlighted the conflict of interest inherent in HKEx's dual role as the commercial operator of the exchange and a regulator setting rules for listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Li hit back, saying: "This is not about one listing candidate or fees earned from a listing here or there, it is about choosing a future path and all the responsibility that entails."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Post reported last month that sources close to Alibaba, founded by teacher-turned-entrepreneur Jack Ma Yun, had said there was no rush to float shares this year and that the real objective was to get a deal done by the end of 2015. If a deal was not done by then, it would likely mean a renegotiation of an agreement struck last year with major shareholder </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> over the terms under which the mainland firm could buy back some of the stake held by the US internet company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's chief strategy officer, Zeng Ming, said yesterday the results of the last round of discussions were not good because the company had underestimated the complexity of negotiations with the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We felt we were wronged," Zeng said. "I think, more than anyone else, Jack felt he was wronged. He was so full of enthusiasm and full of hope towards Hong Kong. But above all, we felt that we hadn't done well enough on our side."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Alibaba had made Hong Kong its top priority when choosing a listing venue. "But we haven't fully discussed with the SFC or exchanged ideas with them in the past," he said. "We have relied too much on the lawyers of both sides to discuss issues on a technical level."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Alibaba spokesman said last week that the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq had accepted its special partnership structure, which would let its top executives nominate the majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But another said the company had yet to select an exchange or appoint underwriters for a listing in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld said yesterday Alibaba would be welcomed in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To the extent they want to come to the US, it's our job to present to them the advantages of listing on Nasdaq," he said.</span></p>
