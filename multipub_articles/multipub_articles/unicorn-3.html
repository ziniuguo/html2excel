<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - or so the saying goes. Some people prefer tall and slender while others prefer short and cuddly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Whatever your preference, in today's image-conscious social media world people generally want to look the best they can, and that's why SenseTime, the world's most highly-valued artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is offering a filter for smartphone cameras and live-streaming apps that can automatically touch you up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Powered by AI-backed technology, the filter identifies different parts of a user's body and face, and touches them up automatically to enhance their look - without distorting the background. The feature marks a major step up from existing products in the market that allow users to mainly “beautify” still pictures of faces and selfies, according to SenseTime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a convenience feature - for example, imagine you feel like live streaming at 10pm but want to skip putting on make-up just for that,” said Li Xingye, SenseTime vice-president of internet and adverts business, at a product launch event held in Beijing on Wednesday. Li said the company will seek to embed the touch-up function into the live-streaming apps of major players via fee-paying partnerships.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">World's most valuable AI start-up SenseTime raises US$620 million[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2148563/worlds-most-valuable-ai-start-sensetime-raises-us620-million]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded at the Hong Kong Science Park in 2014, SenseTime specialises in facial recognition and computer vision, and has positioned itself as a “platform company” for AI technologies. Known for providing AI-powered surveillance software for China's police, SenseTime said it achieved profitability last year on the back of selling AI-powered applications for smart cities, surveillance, smartphones, internet entertainment, finance, retail and other industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company assumed the mantle of the world's most valuable AI start-up in May, with a US$620 million round of financing that valued it at US$4.5 billion. The financing came hot on the heels of an earlier round in April led by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, the parent company of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The live-streaming market has enjoyed explosive growth in China in recent years, and is estimated to be worth US$4.4 billion in 2018 with viewer numbers topping 456 million, according to a Deloitte report. In June, the percentage of time spent on messaging apps among mobile users declined from 36 to 30.2 per cent compared to the same time last year, while time spent on short video apps rose from 2 to 8.8 per cent, according to figures provided by internet data services provider QuestMobile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's selfie king turns his eye to social networking[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2141309/chinas-biggest-selfie-app-meitu-turns-its-eye-social-networking]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To stand out from the crowd, live streamers in China do everything from zany stunts to eating mountains of food, and many go under the surgeon's knife to improve their looks and boost popularity. In the business of live-streaming, getting more attention means earning more money from the “tips” given by fans, as well as from advertising and sponsorship revenue. At peak times each day, more than 100 platforms are live-streaming across China, creating new “internet stars” along the way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the top live-streaming platforms in China include Meitu-owned Meipai, a fashion and beauty-inspired app that has also attracted brands such as </span><span class="s3">L'Oreal</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Maybelline</span><span class="s1"> as users. Meitu markets a range of phones and apps that enable users to beautify their selfies. Meanwhile Huajiao Live, initially part of an incubator run by </span><span class="s3">Qihoo 360</span><span class="s1">, features hundreds of home-made live shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What it takes to be an Internet live-streaming star in China[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2124190/eating-yogurt-deadly-stunts-what-it-takes-be-live-streaming-star]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worldwide, Meitu's apps generate about 6 billion photos a month, and it has been estimated that more than half the selfies uploaded on Chinese social media have been edited using Meitu's products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, SenseTime's “beautifying” function includes settings to adjust the slimness of a user's face, arms, legs, and stomach. There is also an option to broaden or trim down shoulder width or heighten hips to look curvier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Users should beware though - this magic can only work via the auto-beautifying function - face-to-face meetings still require the usual effort to look good.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After wobbling for a few weeks, tech stocks are dropping[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2159986/reversal-fortune-tencent-and-chinese-tech-stocks-are-crashing] like in 2000. This is likely to be the beginning of the end for the biggest tech bubble in history. The US-China trade war[https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war], rising interest rates, and falling exchange rates appear to have finally staunched the liquidity inflow into the bubble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And as in 2000, while the stock bloodbath could be over quickly, the economy would take years to recover from the economic fallout and financial damage inflicted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike in 2000, this tech bubble is bigger in China than in the United States[https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states]. The current tech wave in the US is dominated by companies that have good cash flows. They are not gobbling up cash. Hence, the US tech burst will lead to reasonable valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The expectation that these companies could keep growing rapidly is a pipe dream. Because they take business away from existing companies, rather than create new business, there is a cap on how big they can be.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Things will be different in China. China's tech bubble is very similar to the US dotcom bubble in 2000. There are many companies being financed because they are doing something linked to technology. And, if they get revenue going, the market extrapolates it into infinity and gives them enormous valuations. Hence, they are encouraged to “buy” revenue through subsidies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This means the bubble needs more and more cash to stay afloat. When there are lots of stupid people with lots of money, the game keeps going. But that kind of situation doesn't last very long. As monetary tightening happens around the world, credulous people tend to lose access to money quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 2000 bubble was marked by many con jobs, just not on the scale of the WorldCom and </span><span class="s3">Enron</span><span class="s1"> scandals. These tech companies misled investors with false expectations, even if they didn't cook the books.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China today is in a very similar situation. The obvious example is the P2P (peer-to-peer) boom. It has been a blatant con job from the start. But there were so many credulous savers to be robbed. There was enough money sloshing around to entice both the government and media to join in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cryptocurrencies[https://www.scmp.com/topics/digital-currencies] are another blatant example. There is enough evidence to show that they are a scam, and the market has plummeted lately[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2156165/after-six-months-record-losses-can-cryptocurrencies-look-forward-hack-proof]. Yet the media is still hyping it, and not many governments are banning it outright.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's tech scene is full of semi con jobs. The main reason is government subsidies. In the past few years, local governments have been given the green light to pour money into tech. Suddenly, China has as many unicorns as the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local governments are competing on how many unicorns they have. As in other areas, numbers can be massaged easily. A few guys sit around to decide the valuation of a start-up. When they say it's a unicorn, it pleases their investors and the government.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government support has greatly contributed to the bubble. There are dozens of automobile start-ups. China hasn't got one competitive auto company at present. Why should the market believe that there could be dozens in the future? There are over 2,000 drone companies. Virtually every city is starting a tech park. In one park I visited, some 5,000 start-ups registered last year, mostly with their parents' money.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China's A-share market[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2153074/shanghai-index-rebounds-first-time-after-entering-bear] has been collapsing, many are turning to Hong Kong to raise money[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144880/huge-number-chinese-tech-unicorns-likely-ipo-hong-kong-2018-says] or cash out. It is virtually the only hope. As US sentiment turns sour towards China, the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> isn't likely to be friendly to Chinese “concept companies” - that is, companies that promise an innovative product or service but which look set for big losses as far as the eye can see.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is possible that the Chinese government is directing funds to support the tech IPOs in Hong Kong. But, I doubt that it could mobilise enough money to do it alone. Beijing spends money to entice retail investors. Even in the politically sensitive A-share market, it hasn't managed to keep the market stable. Even if government-directed funds help to launch a few initial public offerings, they will collapse afterwards, making them useless as funding vehicles over time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's tech scene will resemble the US' in the aftermath of the 2000 crash. Most dotcom companies folded, causing massive lay-offs and the loss of trillions of dollars in paper wealth. The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> inflated a property bubble to rescue the economy, which led to the 2008 collapse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China's case, the property market is already a massive bubble. It may burst soon. There are few obvious options for China to bring back economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Retaliating against US tariffs is not in China's interest. Reform is[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2156046/escalating-us-trade-war-not-chinas-interest]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has been obsessed with tech. The current bubble features companies that use the internet to take business away from existing companies; so-called “disruption”. Airlines use commercial jets, probably the most hi-tech equipment in the consumer market, to carry people from A to B. But we don't call airline companies hi-tech. Using hi-tech equipment doesn't make a company hi-tech. It is puzzling why the government has manoeuvred so many resources into a bubble that won't have a meaningful legacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only structural reforms can bring back good growth in China. Instead of wasting so much on pointless bubbles, China should go back to the fundamentals: cutting wasteful investment and returning the money to the people, while encouraging companies to be the best in what they do, instead of playing financial games.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">California Whip is yet to live up to the expectations that followed his impressive arrival in Hong Kong 18 months ago but the five-year-old's victory in the Class One Hong Kong Macau Trophy (1,400m) suggests he might be heading in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Neil Callan aboard, the gelding dug deep in the straight to reel in leader Calculation and trainer Tony Cruz has his sights set on the Group Three Sha Tin Vase on May 27, potentially followed by the Group Three Premier Cup on June 24.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I won on him on the dirt over 1,200m and he broke the track record in Class Three carrying top weight,” Callan said about California Whip's first victory in Hong Kong in January last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the four-year-old series [last season] he had actually been mixing form quite well - he ran well in the Classic Cup and I just thought with a season under his belt he would come out and improve quite a bit. I thought he'd at least be a Group horse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In his early races this season he'd been racing quite well but was bumping into horses like Fifty Fifty and the four-year-olds coming up and I thought maybe he was just limited.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's not where I thought he'd be. I rode him last time and I just had to chase him too hard on the dirt over 1,200m and it just wasn't his go.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With California Whip now likely to get his chance at Group level, Callan is confident there is room for further improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is always a strong pace in the Hong Kong Macau Trophy and I knew going up to the 1,400m it was going to give me the chance to ride a race on him. It is what he's been needing and he did that,” Callan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hopefully that will give him a bit of confidence now and he can maybe try and sneak a Group race in the near future.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It might have been the Hong Kong Macau Trophy but it was a dismal showing from only the two Taipa raiders, with Krystrump and Kelowna Star filling the last two places.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It capped a tough week for the visitors after Mister Kaopu and Victory Megastar were pulled from the field on Friday after testing positive to a prohibited substance.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Everything worked out perfectly for him today,” Cruz said, adding that he was always sceptical about the chances of Romantic Touch sweeping the interport series.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I said he should be in the first three, but I expected The Golden Age to do something but for Romantic Touch, he had no chance in this kind of ground. Only in Macau do you get a soft track.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Callan notched a double on the day, winning the Class Five Guia Hill Handicap (2,200m) with a gem of a ride on Pearl Furu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the leading group bunching up in front of him, Callan seized his moment, booting Pearl Furu to the front at the 1,000m and holding off Holy Unicorn to win for Paul O'Sullivan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The plan was to either lead or sit outside the leader and he jumped well but he had no speed and I couldn't push him around the field in a Class Five because if I used him up like that he wasn't going to finish,” Callan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So I left him alone and the pace kept coming back in my lap and when I got to the 1,200m I just thought ‘let him roll'.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think it was a race-winning move because he is quite a one-paced horse anyway. It was the right time to let him go and I just kept the momentum going and he just kept the gallop going.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market regulator and operator have signalled their reluctance to give their green light to an initial public offering (IPO) by the world's largest assembler of cryptocurrency mining equipment, while a regulatory framework is still being drafted to ring-fence the disruptive technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is premature for any cryptocurrency trading platform - or business associated with the industry - to raise funds through an IPO in Hong Kong before the proper regulatory framework is in place, according to two sources familiar with the matter, speaking to the South China Morning Post on condition of anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reluctance by the regulator and market operator, which provide policy advice to the Listing Committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKEX), could be an insurmountable hurdle in the US$3 billion IPO application by </span><span class="s3">Bitmain Technologies</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest maker of cryptocurrency mining computers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It takes 556 days of computing and a hefty electricity bill to mine a single bitcoin. Is it worth it?[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/investment-products/article/2128518/it-takes-556-days-computing-and-hefty-electricity]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing rules provide for a closed-door hearing before the Listing Committee, which gives the final approval or rejection within six months of an application, after all questions are answered. If the applicant fails to hear from the Listing Committee after the six-month period, the listing lapses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokeswoman at the HKEX said the market operator could not speak about individual cases. </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (CICC), the sponsor of Bitmain's IPO, declined to comment. Bitmain's spokesman declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A rejection for Bitman's fundraising would be another blow to the nascent industry that now finds itself hemmed in by an increasing number of regulatory hurdles, as central banks and other financial regulators worldwide seek to exert control over the disruptive technological phenomenon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2013, Bitmain is the largest assembler of the data-hungry computers used for mining cryptocurrencies, and operator of mining collectives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its explosive growth from start-up to unicorn - a company exceeding US$1 billion in value - traced the 15-fold surge in bitcoin's value in 2017, which created a demand boom for Bitmain's Antminer computers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The size of conventional servers, Antminers are filled with dozens or hundreds of high-powered computer chips known as ASICs that crunch the data needed to verify cryptocurrency transactions. Their cheapest configuration starts from US$200 in Hong Kong[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2176180/bitcoin-mining-rigs-sale-steep-discounts-cryptocurrencies-crash], going up to several thousand dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/12/19/844d3938-0351-11e9-b0d2-cf4a0f50367e_image_hires_190315.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bitmain's first-half net income rose almost ninefold to US$742.7 million from a year earlier, while its revenue jumped almost 10-fold to US$2.8 billion during the same period, according to the company's IPO filing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More of a concern[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2160831/worlds-top-cryptocurrency-miner-may-be-losing-its-edge-analysts-say] to regulators and investors, the company held US$886.9 million worth of cryptocurrency assets at the end of June, or 28 per cent of total assets. That required the company to make “significant provisions” on inventories and cryptocurrency holdings because of the volatile prices, Bitmain said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bitmain's application came in the midst of new rules that are being drafted in Hong Kong for cryptocurrency trading platforms to work. Last year, the regulator and market operator pushed through the biggest reforms to Hong Kong's listing rules in three decades to allow technology companies and pre-revenue biotech research teams to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To keep pace with developments in financial technology, the SFC has created a so-called sandbox to test new rules that can allow these platforms to operate as licensed entities, and get new businesses in Hong Kong. It would therefore be premature for any company to sell stock in an IPO before the sandbox ends, as the regulatory framework may change in future, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/12/19/976d18a6-0362-11e9-b0d2-cf4a0f50367e_image_hires_190315.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Bitmain gets 94 per cent of its revenue from selling computer hardware, and does not operate as a cryptocurrency platform, the hurdle put up by the Hong Kong regulators underscores how any business related to virtual currencies could be swept under a broad category of alternative assets that are now subject to additional scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One idea under consideration is for only professional investors to be eligible to invest in these cryptocurrency assets, the SFC's chief executive Ashley Alder had said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, Bitmain isn't the first to have the door shut in its face.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trainer Caspar Fownes still regards Rainbow Chic's Hong Kong Derby defeat with chagrin but he was preferring to look ahead last night as the four-year-old showed how far he has come with victory in the Happy Valley Vase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mental game was holding back Rainbow Chic in his earliest days in Hong Kong and field shyness blamed for his close fourth in the Derby, but last night it mattered nothing to the gelding as he shrugged off a heavy bump forcing out of a pocket at the 200m to finish off powerfully. He's only just getting the hang of it all and we're going to see a lot more from him CASPAR FOWNES</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the Derby, you see him with other horses around him and he's looking at them and not concentrating on racing - I still think with clear room he'd have won it but he just wouldn't race when it got tight," Fownes said last night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"And what he did tonight, there's no way he'd have done that and have that sort of contact with another horse and then go through with it. He's a good horse, he's only just getting the hang of it all and we're going to see a lot more from him next season as he matures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rainbow Chic had been targeted towards last night's 1,800m Class One for some time, but was backing up from a solid Class Two second with 133 pounds on Sunday. "This was the race I wanted with him, he'd run well at Happy Valley the only other night he came here and I think the cushion in the track here suits him," Fownes explained.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But when Pure Champion was put in this race, he compressed the weights and it changed the equation a bit for me. So I thought I'd run him on the weekend and back him up - if he won on Sunday, he'd have gone up in weight and Brett Prebble could ride him, if not I had Vincent to ride him on the light weight and he's given him a great ride."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Obviously the stewards panel thought so too, Ho escaping with only a reprimand for the incident in the straight, and the win gave the young rider a double for the card after scoring earlier for Tony Millard on True Courage, also part of a double for the trainer, who provided Zac Purton's only victory of the card.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Flying Unicorn just had his night tonight," Purton said after chipping Douglas Whyte's championship lead to only two wins. "He's been racing well and he's often there around them but he needs it all to go right and tonight he sneaked one - it was a plus to be up on the speed which is his natural style."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Matthew Chadwick had been dumped on the track on the weekend by California Dude on the way to the gates for a race and missed his final rides, but bounced back straight away with a win for Derek Cruz on new Class Five acquisition Starlit Warrior and later added Beauty Sparkle for Tony Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he was not as fortunate as others in the stewards' room, getting a three-day ban and $80,000 fine for careless riding on Tres Magnifique in the third race. It was Chadwick's seventh suspension this season but at least he had the winners to take away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beauty Sparkle felt good going to the start and he had gate one, a big plus tonight, and won well but he isn't very robust," Chadwick said. "Maybe he can still improve next season if he can strengthen up a bit."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starlit Warrior had been 18 starts without a placing under Andy Leung Ting-wah, but was able to win at the first time of asking for Cruz and Chadwick said there was still room for advancement off his 14 rating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"He was on and off the bridle, very green and awkward," he said. "He's limited but if he can learn to run straight, he'd have to win another race off such a low rating."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia is becoming one of the focal points for global investors and Chinese technology conglomerates looking to expand outside their home market. The region's diversity and population have made it both an attractive and difficult target to crack.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Typically defined as the region east of India, west of New Guinea, north of Australia and south of China, Southeast Asia is home to some 655 million people in 11 countries that range from a city-state like Singapore to archipelagic nations like Indonesia and the Philippines, to landlocked Laos, speaking different languages and practising different religions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's largest hi-tech companies have made forays into the region, with </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> buying the Southeast Asian e-commerce firm </span><span class="s3">Lazada Group</span><span class="s1"> and signing cooperation deals with Malaysia and Thailand. </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, the gaming-and-social media giant, has invested in Singapore-based Sea, which operates the Shopee e-commerce site and Garena gaming and esports platform. </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> led an investment round into Thai online fashion brand Pomelo last year, while the region's two biggest internet platform start-ups, Singapore's Grab and Indonesia's Go-Jek, count Chinese tech unicorns </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Meituan Dianping as investors, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia “is becoming a proxy war for large Chinese internet companies like Tencent, Alibaba and we think going forward this will increase”, said Hian Goh, who founded Openspace Ventures in 2014 and has invested in start-ups such as Go-Jek, Halodoc, Redmart and Chope. “Already, we see Go-Jek, our portfolio company, receive investments from </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> as well as </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">, and JD has done a joint venture with </span><span class="s3">Central Group</span><span class="s1"> in Thailand. We think a lot of the capital funding could come from these strategic sources as well as venture capital.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the increasing interest in Southeast Asia has boosted valuations, they are still more “reasonable” compared with Silicon Valley or China, according to several venture capitalists interviewed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There's a joke that start-ups in Silicon Valley would add a zero behind their asking price if they knew Chinese investors were interested because of their reputation for being willing to bet large sums of money,” said Grace Yun Xia, Singapore-based principal at Jungle Ventures, which is looking to raise US$200 million for a third fund targeted at Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Jungle Ventures</span><span class="s1">' strategy is to invest in start-ups that can solve problems endemic to the region, according to Xia, who was formerly the senior director of corporate strategy and investment at Tencent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consumer lending, fintech and payments should continue to be hot areas for investment because they are “pain points”, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financing for Southeast Asia's technology sector totalled US$6.3 billion across 422 deals last year, up from about US$300,000 for 100 deals in 2012, according to data from venture capital research service CB Insights. It recently reported that Hong Kong-listed Tencent, which runs China's largest video games and social media businesses, had been most active investing in North America from 2013 to March this year. In the same period, e-commerce giant Alibaba, along with affiliate Ant Financial Services, has focused on investing in the rest of Asia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the souring ties between the US and China, more investment interest may be redirected from Silicon Valley to other regions. US President Donald Trump hinted this week that he would restrict Chinese investments in the US[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2152645/donald-trump-says-he-favours-steven-mnuchins-path] through a government agency that has already derailed several proposed acquisitions over the past year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at a lunch with lawmakers in Washington, Trump said the </span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) </span><span class="s1">would help counter the acquisition of US companies that develop advanced technologies. </span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1"> is an inter-agency body that assesses the national security implications of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers that could result in foreign control of any US business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I just got off a call last night with yet another top unicorn in China,” said Khailee Ng, a managing partner at 500 Startups overseeing its Southeast Asia fund. “They redirected interest to Southeast Asia but also India. I haven't spoken to my contacts at other firms yet, but I would not be surprised.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A redirection of investor money into Southeast Asia would benefit start-ups looking to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the most prominent start-ups out of the region, by far, is Grab, which was established as a taxi-booking app in Singapore and Malaysia (its earliest names were </span><span class="s3">GrabTaxi</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">MyTeksi</span><span class="s1">, respectively), and is now in eight markets. Grab has telegraphed its ambitions to become a platform company and started a venture capital arm to back promising start-ups that it can integrate into its business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its rival, Go-Jek, is currently in fewer countries, but has more services than Grab on its booking app in Indonesia, from massages to home cleaning to filling pharmacy prescriptions. It, too, has announced plans to expand regionally, with Thailand and Vietnam as the first stops in its foray outside its home market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Historically what has been the biggest opportunities are copycat models - what has worked elsewhere … like the US and China - transplanted over here,” said Ng, who has invested in Grab. “There are still pockets of business models that can be replicated and are not done very well in Southeast Asia, specifically within fintech.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On the horizon of trends for start-ups that we're betting on is deep tech,” he said. “We see Southeast Asia as a market ready to accept solutions that come from life sciences, energy, big data, artificial intelligence and even from space.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Southeast Asia remains relatively under-represented in terms of start-ups with the potential to scale up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Thailand, the entire start-up scene began taking off only three years ago in 2015, according to Robert Lomnitz, director of Bangkok Venture Club, a network of investors, entrepreneurs and executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And because many of the Southeast Asian countries are mobile-first markets, they have skipped the progression seen in more mature markets, Lomnitz said. This has also meant that the mobile network operators in Thailand have been incubating the start-ups to look for content and mobile apps that they can use, whereas in other more developed markets, the incumbents typically are the ones being disrupted and challenged by start-ups, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Literally it went from writing things on a piece of paper to a 4G network in almost no time,” Lomnitz said. “That makes the market very different from historical early-stage markets, so I think it will be quicker, the growth of all of this … Business models are different and the approach needs to be a little different as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All the investors and entrepreneurs that the South China Morning Post spoke with over the past month from around the region said the diversity in this large market was both a competitive advantage for local players and a defensive moat against external players.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Tan Yinglan, founding managing partner of Insignia Venture Partners, Southeast Asia has just started the second half of a metaphorical football match.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the first half, the platform companies in e-commerce, ride-hailing and game publishing have been established,” said Tan, who has invested in start-ups such as used-car marketplace Carro and co-working space EVHive. “In the second half, where the models involve local operations and are transactional, it would be challenging for these players to build their own operations in Southeast Asia, and we believe that they are more likely to make strategic investments or acquisitions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opportunities are in industry segments such as automobiles, property, logistics, health care, education, Tan said. He is steering clear of areas like live-streaming, news-reader apps and other asset-light businesses where Chinese players as well as the likes of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are competing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increasing interest in Southeast Asia means that valuations inevitably are heading up. While that is good news for entrepreneurs, it also means the risks and expectations for start-ups among investors are higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Valuations in Southeast Asia are “much more reasonable at the lower levels, at the higher level, when you're raising half a billion dollars, you're playing on the global stage, it's the same globally,” said Ong Peng Tsin, managing partner of technology fund Monk's Hill Ventures and co-founder of Match.com. “My personal opinion is that there's too much money floating around.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For some investors [they think] ‘If I invest money and I lose money, I don't make money. If I don't invest money, I don't make money. So the only way I make money is if I invest it.' So usually investors don't care what the risk is, they'll invest,” Ong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“So you're seeing all these billion of dollars pumped into the global PE tech market. If the companies can keep up, that's OK, but not all of them can keep up.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen Zhang, founder and chief executive of Beibei.com, China's largest online shop specialising in mother and baby products, expects businesses to more than double in 2017, buoyed by the company's expanded supply chain and enriched product offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou-based Beibei plans to achieve gross merchandise volume (GMV) sales of 10 billion yuan in 2017, up from this year's 4 billion yuan after it became profitable in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gross merchandise volume (GMV) is a standard often used by e-commerce companies to measure sales growth. The metric tallies the value of transactions processed on the online platforms, which counts in the orders cancelled by buyers later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We'll see difficulties in taking each step ahead from now on," Zhang said. "We want to make our supply chain stronger, give customers better experience and fine-tune product offerings to support fast business growth."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beibei, established in 2014, is a "unicorn" - unlisted technology firms valued at more than US$1 billion that receives investment from a clutch of renowned venture capital funds including IDG and Capital Today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang, 30, is among the mainland's rising business stars. He has a Master's of Engineering Degree and had a brief work stint with e-commerce juggernaut </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> between 2009 and 2011, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After Beibei eked out a profit, I felt entirely relieved since we can do many things at our own will," said Zhang. "We are in the second half of a game in which we will chase a larger scale of the businesses based on profitable model."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's market for mother and baby products is estimated to hit 2 trillion yuan this year, according to consultancy iResearch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online transactions of mother and baby products are valued at about 300 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Beijing ended the decades-long one-child policy last year to encourage adults to have a second child, the market has been increasingly viewed as attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beibei's ultimate goal is to become a world-class e-tailer driven by the best technologies," Zhang said. "We will focus on the ‘mum economy', which is a mammoth market to tap."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists forecast that the second-child policy would lead to an additional 3 million newborn babies in China every year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang said mainland startups are grappling with a "nuclear winter" this year after venture capitalists refrained from splashing out millions of dollars worth of backing to own a share of those technology firms perceived as future stars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mid-2016, Beibei completed the latest round of financing, raising US$100 million from a consortium of investors including New Horizon Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was among the few "unicorns" that received fresh capital from venture capital funds this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Zhigang, founder of online media group New Top 100 and a well-known writer about China's technology sector, said that efficient management of the supply chain held the key to online shopping success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The new economy is obviously an enhanced integration of online and offline operations," he said. "The scale of the supply chain in your hand decides the business volume that you can handle."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beibei sells both domestic and imported products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has overseas facilities in Hong Kong, Japan and the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is categorised as trailing giants such as Alibaba and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beibei wants to go it alone, and we don't want to be acquired by any bigger players," Zhang said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, the first technology unicorn landing on Hong Kong's market this year, rose on its trading debut on Friday, after its US$1.12 billion initial public offering received a retail oversubscription of 653 times, becoming the most sought after main listing since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Good Doctor, formally known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company</span><span class="s1">, advanced as much as 7 per cent to HK$58.7 in mid-morning action. It was quoted at HK$55.6 by noon, about 1.5 per cent higher than its IPO price of HK$54.8.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bullish price action bucked the overall weaker market trend, as the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.4 per cent by the mid-session close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At its current price, the online medical and health care service platform had a market value of HK$60 billion (US$7.64 billion), versus rival </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Health Information Technology</span><span class="s1">'s value of HK$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor saw turnover of HK$2.8 billion so far, with 49 million shares changed hands, ranking as the second most heavily traded stock on the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spin-off of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, Good Doctor is currently China's largest online health care and medical platform by user numbers. At the end of 2017, it had 193 million registrants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the company is not profitable yet. In 2017 the company reported a loss of 1 billion yuan, its third straight year of losses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Wang Tao, chairman and chief executive for Good Doctor, said he is confident the firm can generate solid revenues and turn profitable in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The company is still in the early development phase of obtaining users and traffic,” Wang said Friday at the listing ceremony in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to build a one-stop online medical and health care platform and need to boost traffic and change user behaviour at the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor prices US$1.12 billion IPO at top end amid retail frenzy[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143745/ping-good-doctor-prices-us112-billion-ipo-top-end-amid-retail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking ahead, Wang said the company will use the IPO proceeds to expand its user base and focus on growing its consumer health care and family doctor services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor had priced its IPO at the top end of the HK$50.80 to HK$54.80 range. The capital raising was the biggest in value this year, with the retail portion attracting share subscriptions 653 times greater than the shares on offer. The oversubscription rate exceeded the investor enthusiasm for China Literature, which was oversubscribed by 625 times during its November debut in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor's international tranche was also “massively” oversubscribed, according to sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing, which has drained liquidity from Hong Kong's banking system, could ignite investor enthusiasm and become a catalyst for a pipeline of blockbuster new-economy IPOs this year, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing rules, which permit dual-class share listings by technology companies as well as biotech companies that have yet to show a profit, will draw a flurry of listing applications from young companies, said Edmond Hui, chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Bright Smart Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this week, Xiaomi, one of China's largest smartphone makers, filed for an IPO in Hong Kong in what could become the world's biggest stock flotation since Alibaba's US$25 billion debut in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think we are going to see a hot IPO market in the next few months, with a number of tech unicorns coming to Hong Kong after Xiaomi,” said Hui.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Good Doctor's prospectus, around 40 per cent of the proceeds raised will be used for business expansion, such as its e-commerce business, hiring sales and medical professionals, acquiring new users and funding marketing activities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Venture capital (VC) investment in China's thriving new economy - based on the expanding use of smartphones - is becoming riskier, warns veteran investor Helen Wong, whose company joined the most recent financing round for one of China's highest-profile unicorns, the bike-sharing service Mobike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is not like before when growth was relatively easy for start-ups, when user numbers and activities were exploding in the mobile internet world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Nowadays with every one having more than 20 apps on their smartphone, it becomes harder to tempt new installations," said Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She was speaking at an alumni event held in Hong Kong by </span><span class="s3">INSEAD</span><span class="s1">, one of the world's leading and largest graduate business schools.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong's argument is backed up by a latest study from data provider QuestMobile, which</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">showed the number of active smartphone used in China grew from 1.03 billion to 1.06 billion in the first nine months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the month-on-month growth rate decreasing from 13.1 per cent in January to 7 per cent in September, which shows "demographic dividend depletion, while user growth in the mobile internet industry faces huge challenges".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global venture capitalists splashed out US$39 billion worth of investment in the third quarter, according to KPMG's Venture Pulse report for the period, with more than a quarter of that (US$10.2 billion) heading into China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's bike-sharing giants could merge to stop the cash burning[http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2113100/chinas-bike-sharing-giants-could-merge-stop-cash-burning]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With online traffic still largely monopolised by a few industry giants such as Tencent, however, looking for new avenues of investment is becoming more challenging.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors say they have been seeing much faster shifts in investor target areas, leading to several "mini cycles" taking place, Wong said, citing two typical examples: shared power banks, and mini KTV systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On October 11, Hangzhou-based power bank rental start-up LeDian announced it had shut down its business altogether and retrieved all its devices, while at the same time telling some existing users they might face difficulties withdrawing deposits due to an overload on its server.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's only six months ago that the shared power bank business triggered a rush in investment into similar ideas. In 10 days since late March, five start-ups in the sector pocketed a combined 300 million yuan (US$45.2 million) financing from 20 institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors have got to stay nimble and sober," Wong said, adding she believes there will be good opportunities in sectors in future such as the further integration of online and offline shopping, and the online entertainment market dominated by those born after 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's small power bank rental firms to be ousted in battle for market share[http://www.scmp.com/tech/social-gadgets/article/2099049/chinas-small-power-bank-rental-firms-be-ousted-battle-market]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since last year, Wong has led three rounds of investment by her firm Qiming into Mobike, which now values China's high-profile bike sharing firm at US$3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since late September there has been talk of a merger between the country's two leading bike sharers, Mobike and Ofo - itself another unicorn - but Wong believes both can successfully continue independently, but only by expanding their service offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In China, the tradition seems to be when you have two top players in an area, they merge. But it is not necessarily the case for Mobike and Ofo," Wong said.The ambitions of a company are always an interesting question - we definitely do not want to exit early if an entrepreneur is capable of growing their business bigger, even though he or she might not make any profit for yearsHelen Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's bike-sharing platforms, which enable users to pick up and dump bikes anywhere, any time, by scanning a code with their smartphone, has attracted a staggering US$2 billion in funding over the last 18 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the top of the tree are Mobike and Ofo. However, fierce prices wars have already forced out smaller competitors, leaving the realistic profitability of the two top players in question.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week saw the sector's biggest casualty yet, with the third biggest player Bluegogo - the Tianjin-based start-up that boasted 20 million registered users at its peak - going bust due to a shortage of cash and the strain of growing cutthroat competition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong's optimism for the two market leaders is based on their strong business expansion plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobike is now moving into car sharing, partnering with electric car-maker Xinte Electric, it said earlier this month, to launch a fleet of shared cars, dubbing "Mocars".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The ambitions of a company are always an interesting question - we definitely do not want to exit early if an entrepreneur is capable of growing their business bigger, even though he or she might not make any profit for years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"On the other hand, I have watched too many entrepreneurs insist on expanding their companies too quickly, which can often lead them to miss what many see as their ultimate goal: an IPO (initial public offering)," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said the US, Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets are all looking for different types of companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US investors like room for growth and are willing to invest for the future. The mainland market stresses earnings and profitability, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong is somewhere in between, with smaller internet companies with strong consumer bases and brand awareness having the best chance of success.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bar to compete in China's highly competitive premium car-hailing market, currently dominated by </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, was just raised after internet giant Baidu entered the fray by agreeing to provide a chauffeur service provider with funding and access to its artificial intelligence technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur, a Chinese car-hailing company backed by state-owned transport service group Beijing Shouqi Group, said on Monday it has raised an additional 1.3 billion yuan (US$196 million) from investors including Baidu and Chinese smart electric vehicle maker NIO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The amount includes 600 million yuan from a series B round led by China Minsheng Trust and 700 million yuan from a B+ round led by Baidu and NIO. Shouqi said the latest funding has propelled the two-year-old start-up to "unicorn" status - a private company with a valuation of more than US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi Chuxing plans to use this one advantage to crush its rivals in race for self-driving cars[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2083875/didi-chuxing-plans-use-one-advantage-crush-its-rivals-race-self]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The alliance is expected to intensify competition in China's premium chauffeur-driven car market, currently dominated by ride-hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> with an estimated 70 per cent share of rides.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wei Dong, chief executive of Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur, said the new investment was more than just a financial deal because Baidu and NIO are expected to help it build a new transport ecosystem that "combines capital, smart cars, artificial intelligence and quality service."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shang Guobin, deputy director of Baidu's autonomous driving division, said the company invested in Shouqi because it wanted a strong partner to commercialise its autonomous driving technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is still too early to say who will be the winner of China's ride-hailing market, especially with more and more consumers preferring quality chauffeur services," said Shang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following a strategic partnership inked between Baidu and Shouqi in late October, Wei said the two firms have been working to bring autonomous driving to China's roadways by 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These pilot projects will still have drivers to monitor the car but the idea is to give passengers a taste of what the future of transport would be like," he told the South China Morning Post in an interview last week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, which ranks as the world's second largest start-up with a valuation of US$50 billion, has also been ramping up research into AI and environmentally-friendly mobility technology as it sees autonomous driving and green energy cars as the future of the ride-sharing business. In March the company opened a research lab in Silicon Valley, where it has been hiring local talent to work on technologies such as autonomous driving.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to consultancy Roland Berger, the size of the premium chauffeur car market in China is expected to grow to 500 billion yuan (US$75 billion) by 2020 from 7.7 billion yuan in 2015 as the service expands to smaller cities and as more consumers are willing to pay extra for better service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shouqi said its number of monthly active users has reached 2.4 million, still tiny compared with to more than 25 million per day for </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vietnam enjoys a complicated relationship with Chinese tourists, who make up a significant proportion of its international arrivals - in 2017, 4 million of the 12.9 million visitors hailed from its northern neighbour. Just last month, anti-China sentiment peaked in protests and calls for a code of conduct[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/travel/article/2151473/do-chinese-tourists-need-code-conduct-while] specific to visitors from the Middle Kingdom, although tensions appear to have cooled, with authorities such as Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Tourism hoping to triple the number of Chinese tourists it welcomes in just two years, according to a July 13 report in online newspaper VietnamNet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under fire now are not the tourists themselves, but rather the way that some of them travel - namely, on “zero-dong” tours. Run by Chinese-owned proxy companies, these are low-priced package deals aimed at budget travellers, renowned for injecting little into the local economy and recognisable by their busloads of tourists, who are often pressured into buying expensive gifts and services once on holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Vietnam, they are popular in the coastal province of Khanh Hoa, where Nha Trang is located; around Da Nang and Hoi An; and in Quang Ninh province, which is home to Halong Bay and border town Mong Cai, the entry point for many Chinese. Online newspaper Hanoitimes reported in March that authorities were closely observing tourism activities in Quang Ninh following the closure of a zero-dong company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent years, authorities in Thailand have attempted to put a stop to similar “zero-dollar[https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/2130551/chinese-zero-dollar-tour-companies-dodge-thai-crackdown-and]” or “forced shopping” tours, asserting that they tarnish the image of the country. The initial crackdown in October 2016 affected arrivals to the country. An article on Channel NewsAsia's online platform noted that Chinese visitor numbers dropped 12 per cent in the last quarter of 2016, compared to the same period the previous year. However, China remains the main source of international arrivals for Thailand by a significant margin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking to VietnamNet, Tu Quy Thanh, director of Ho Chi Minh City-based travel company Lien Bang Travelink, which specialises in the Chinese-speaking market, said that most Vietnamese travel agents in Ho Chi Minh City refuse to run zero-dong tours. Instead, they are targeting more affluent Chinese travellers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, the independent Chinese tourist is the unicorn of the travel industry, a near-mythical beast with unlimited spending power who is driven by a desire to experience something new and unique. However, recent trends suggest these travellers are not as rare as once imagined. China's increasingly well-travelled millennials are far less interested in package tours than previous generations, preferring to make their own way overseas, and everyone is trying to court them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 2016 report put together by </span><span class="s3">Skyscanner</span><span class="s1"> and UnionPay Smart on Chinese “free, independent travellers” showed that the majority were aged from 15 to 33, hailed from China's top-tier cities, enjoyed shopping while overseas and preferred destinations such as Thailand and Japan. Vietnam's tourism sector hopes that by clamping down on zero-dong tour operators it can make it onto that list.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking of travel agencies that have fallen foul of Vietnamese authorities, Vietnam Aladin Travel and Trading, the company behind the tour attended by the controversial “nine-dash line” T-shirt-wearing Chinese tourists[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2146258/anger-vietnam-after-chinese-tourists-arrive-airport-wearing], was fined 42 million Vietnamese dong (US$1,817) and forced to suspend activities for nine months, according to a July 7 report on digital news portal VnExpress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Nha Trang-based company said it had paid the fine and that it would be ceasing activities owing to the long suspension period and “other issues”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Travel guide company Lonely Planet recently published its Best in Asia list. Compiled by its “travel experts”, who, “combed the charming beach towns, scoured the cloud-snagging skylines and poked around the prehistoric temple complexes of the ever-changing Asian continent to bring you their recommendations”, the line-up is led by South Korea's second city, Busan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Coming in at No 2 is Uzbekistan, once a prominent player on the Silk Road, which is now opening up to tourism, although Lonely Planet does note that it lags behind its neighbours in terms of human rights. The third spot is given to Vietnam's biggest and busiest metropolis, Ho Chi Minh City.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Fifa World Cup in Russia saw the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) used for the first time in a final to award France a 38th-minute penalty. But this is not the only innovation to emerge from the worldwide event, as Shenzhen-based ultra-thin flexible display maker Royole also proved that watching soccer games on goods such as hats and clothes is now a reality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese company arranged for several spectators at the 2018 final between France and Croatia on Sunday to wear top hats equipped with its flexible display broadcasting the soccer final live. The flexible sensor technology incorporates a high-definition 2K resolution bended display which streams content from a user's mobile phone or tablet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole has also developed T-shirts embedded with its flexible displays, which means you can now watch TV on peoples' clothes or use them as walking advertising billboards. Washing the clothes is not a problem as the displays and related circuitry can be easily removed from the T-shirts and top hats before cleaning, said the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Flexible displays are seen by many as one of the key future trends for mobile electronics, with a number of top smartphone makers including South Korea's </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1"> believed to be readying the launch of flexible displays that will allow for the commercial production of “foldable” phones in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Future phones: foldable like a napkin, with up to nine cameras and able to charge over thin air[https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2153937/future-phones-foldable-napkin-nine-cameras-and-able-charge-over-thin-air]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tricked-out T-shirts and top hats are not cheap though, costing 5,888 yuan (US$882) each or 8,888 yuan for a combo deal, according to Royole's website. The items are also on limited offer only and won't be shipped until November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The flexible displays are attached to a small external power supply than can be recharged multiple times, with a usage time of about 10 hours supported by a 10,000 mAh (milliampere hour) power bank, said Jason Fan, a vice-president of Royole.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The display embedded on hats and clothes is light, thin, soft and rich in colour, making it good for daily wear,” said Fan, adding that it can be applied to a wider range of uses, such as intelligent transport, smart homes and robotic products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole, a Chinese unicorn valued at more than US$3 billion after raising US$800 million in its fourth and biggest round of funding from a group of heavyweight investors, was founded in August 2012 in Silicon Valley, Hong Kong and Shenzhen. In 2014, it released the world's thinnest 0.01mm full-colour bendable and rollable screen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, founded by CEO Bill Liu Zihong, began operations at its 1.1-million-square-foot production campus in Shenzhen in early June this year. The plant will mass produce its fully flexible displays, which can be bent, folded or curled, for commercial use.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies chairman, Francis Leung Pak-to, also known as “father of red chips” said on Monday that the chamber supported the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed separate board to list dual class share companies here, but not new start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has just ended a consultation last Friday for the third board's establishment, whose listing requirements differ from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, essentially aimed at providing a listing venue for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two platforms: a premium market that is open to all investors and will host companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but have a dual-class share structure which the exchange currently disallows. The second is for start-ups where only professional investors can invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung was opposed to the start-up board for the high risks that entailed. “Many start-ups lack track records and have a high risk of failure. They are not suitable to be traded on the stock exchange,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He supported however, the launch of a separate board only for the dual class shares with a market capitalisation of HK$8 billion, which is similar to a so-called unicorn new economy firm valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list here,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are plenty of mainland “unicorns” which would be interested to list in Hong Kong, but our market needs to prepare itself for these companies. This is why we would need this new board that accept dual class share companies to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many big technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are dual class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than the others. Hong Kong bans such types of companies to list but US allows it, which has led mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to go for a listing in New York in 2014, instead of Hong Kong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list hereFrancis Leung Pak-to, Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Three years after losing Alibaba and our market still has done nothing to address the issue. We need to make sure our market can capture these companies to list. This is why we need to introduce the third board soon,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I introduced the red chips in Hong Kong in the 1990s, there were many criticisms that these companies are different from other H-shares. But then, we have many successful listings - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Citic, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> - and they are still heavily traded by investors,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A red chip is a company incorporated in Hong Kong but has a mainland parent, which is different from an H-share company which is established in the mainland but listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also against the HKEX's proposal to let US-listed mainland companies seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This rule will turn Hong Kong into a second-tier market as most big players will go list in the US and then seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. We oppose to this proposal,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> has opposed to dual class share listings as they reduce the ability for fund managers to exercise their voting rights to decide on the remuneration, director appointments and other important corporate affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund body said the development of dual class shares were “negative” to investor protection and urged the exchange to stick to “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly getting flattened at the start and being stopped in his tracks may have been the best thing that happened to Holyangelholy last start, as it forced the four-year-old into a more relaxed racing pattern and left him in a perfect position to sprint home in a suitably fast-run event.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holyangelholy had been disappointing from a purely on-paper performance stand-point - starting short in the market in each of his six previous starts. But after that confidence-building last-start win, it seems the gelding is now ready to do what John Size-trained horses regularly do: progress through the grades - starting with the opening leg of Sunday's Triple Trio at Sha Tin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six points for a three-quarter length win keeps Holyangelholy in Class Four. He has drawn barrier one and Douglas Whyte returns to the saddle, but what appeals most is the promise of another genuinely run race.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My Memory (Ben So Tik-hung) is back up in grade and, while he may struggle with that, he will still get out and run. Regency Champion (Matthew Chadwick) is a chance to come over and create pressure from barrier 10, and possibly first-starter Gratified (Olivier Doleuze), who travelled keen in his last trial, could get in the on-pace mix.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sitting back at the tail is another backmarker waiting for the right race, the Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained Why Not (Howard Cheng Yue-tin). He progressed through distances up to a mile in his first season, but there was nothing wrong with his first run over 1,200m on debut. After Alvin Ng Ka-chun fell off Why Not when he was resuming over 1,400m in September, that might also have been a blessing, as he now steps back in trip.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One to watch is John Moore's first-starter Hit A Home Run (Tim Clark). He has had limited exposure with just two trials, but he looks a real natural and has drawn ideally in four. It wouldn't surprise for him to run in the first three. Throw in Regency Champion from the on-pace brigade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the middle leg, bank on How Speedy (Richard Fourie) getting better luck from a wide gate this time round after he was stuck on a limb facing the breeze last start.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How Speedy was three-and-four deep with no cover but managed to stick on to finish second to subsequent Class Three winner Little Cow, and breeding suggests the step up to 1,400m suits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elegant Frames (Weichong Marwing) may have got the soft-as-butter run last time out, but there is no reason why he won't get something similar again from gate three, and he, too, will be suited by the extra ground third-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One Of A Kind (Whyte) has drawn one and must be included, while consideration should be given to last-start Class Five winner Able Magic (Derek Leung Ka-chun) and Winning Bear (Brett Prebble).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the final leg, go without a banker and play narrow - but the Richard Gibson-trained Always Something (Olivier Doleuze) is an option as stand-out. He should win a race soon after finally finding his way back into Class Four.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">King Haradasun (Whyte) looked disappointing on face value last start, but the progression to 1,600m at his third run in is what he needs and barrier six is not too bad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Others to include are David Hall-trained Surrounded (Prebble), who continues to surprise but has again drawn wide, and Caspar Fownes' Blossom Daily, who was heavily backed when winning last start and drops into gate one.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> Dianping, one of China's most valuable private tech firms, is gearing up to challenge the monopoly of ride hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, a move almost certain to trigger a new price war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">, known as the Chinese </span><span class="s3">Yelp</span><span class="s1"> for its online-to-offline business model offering services from restaurant reviews, food delivery, movie ticketing and travel bookings, is expected to launch a national expansion of its ride-hailing business after debuting the service in Nanjing city in December, according to a </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> employee familiar with the plans who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The employee confirmed that the company will soon launch ride-hailing services in at least five cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen in south China's Fujian province.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A warrior's oath has been sworn at internal meetings,” said the source, referring to a motivational technique to spur employees to battle it out for the ride hailing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Services （in several cities）are slated to kick off by the end of this month,” said the source.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> declined to comment on its ride hailing expansion plans, which were reported earlier by Tencent News.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Didi, which counts tech giants Apple, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings among its biggest shareholders, has been the dominant player in China's ride-hailing market after pushing </span><span class="s3">Uber Technologies</span><span class="s1"> out of the country in 2016. Didi and Uber engaged in a destructive price war for dominance in China, with billions of yuan invested to buy loyalty from riders and drivers, effectively giving consumers free rides to win market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Didi and Uber splurged money to cultivate user habits, and by coming to the market late we can save this cost,” the </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> source said. “As Didi begins to profit by charging a higher commission from drivers, we stand to gain public favour.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's ride-hailing king channels Genghis Khan in preparation for a new price war [http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2126196/chinas-ride-hailing-king-channels-genghis-khan-preparation-new]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> raised US$4.1 billion in its latest funding round in October, providing a war chest for future investment in existing businesses and new business development. The company's private valuation of US$30 billion puts it behind Uber, </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Xiaomi, and ahead of </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">, as the world's fourth most valuable unicorn, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a strong player such as </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> joining the nationwide ride-hailing market, a new price war is inevitable, said Zhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As a late mover in the market </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will need to invest money to make its name in the ride-hailing business, especially given Didi's well-established position in China,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> is reportedly offering drivers low commission fees and high bonuses to entice them over to its app, and incentives to lure consumers are set to follow, according to Zhao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The app for </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> drivers is ranked number 89 under the category of “tools”, according to iTunes China store, with user comments including posts such as “hoping </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will come to Xi'an city soon”, and “hoping </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> will end the embarrassment of Didi being the sole player”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For its part, Didi is not afraid of the competition, according to its chief executive Cheng Wei. “Didi has withstood the fiercest competition in history, from Kuaidi to Uber. We have PK'ed countless rivals,” said Cheng, using local slang for beating an opponent in games. “</span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1"> may not be the weakest, but it may not be the strongest either,” he said in an interview with Chinese media outlet Caijing in January, the transcript of which was verified by Didi.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I have a personal story to share with you about the development of private equity, which may offer some indication of how fast the industry has grown over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many years ago I was appointed by my former employer Reuters as the British news agency's Asia private equity (PE) correspondent. When I tried to introduce my job to friends in China, I was a little surprised that somethought PE stood for “physical exercise”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When I relayed this experience to acquaintances at </span><span class="s3">KKR</span><span class="s1">, one of the world's biggest private equity fund houses, they told me they had encountered similar misunderstandings on the mainland in recent years. They had to keep explaining to local entrepreneurs that they weren't a gang on in anyway linked to the Ku Klux Klan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nowadays people in China, and elsewhere, have a better understanding of what private equity and venture capital are all about. Some may not have heard of </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">, but almost everyone knows </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and Apple, two high-profile examples of companies that Sequoia helps to build and grow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, private equity and venture capital managers are often dubbed “gods of fortune” by the media. As long as you can get funding from VCs and PEs, your start-up will grow, or at least there is no need for you to worry about surviving in a tough market in the early stages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/12/09/cee358d2-9e47-11e5-b919-9dd19e242533_image_hires.jpg?itok=uKm4UyFT]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But I would like to take the opportunity here to pose a simple question: What is the ultimate goal of venture capital, private equity and all those start-ups and new technology?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is it just about making money, getting higher returns for your investors, or getting your portfolio companies to launch their IPOs as quickly as possible?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Please don't get me wrong. Private equity and venture capital funds are not charity organisations. You must make money, and you'd better make a lot to stay competitive. I'm not against materialism or capitalism. Even non-profit organisations need to build revenue streams before they can do good. But if you want to make a difference, then you need to think about what your mission is.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> has a clear mission to organise global data. </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s mission is to keep everyone connected. My current employer, the South China Morning Post, aims to serve as a bridge between the West and East, particularly Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I recently met the co-founder of a fast delivery start-up operating in the business-to-business sphere who had just completed the first round of funding with several venture capitalists. He explained his business model to me and how the company rose quickly to become the market leader with the biggest network coverage in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/12/09/fb2bf2f4-9e48-11e5-b919-9dd19e242533_image_hires.jpg?itok=4V57hPEc]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then he asked me for some advice. I asked him if his goal was just to grow and become a “unicorn” - with a valuation in excess of US$1 billion - or he should think beyond the number of apartments his company can reach in the city and figure out ways of using big data to help make people's lives easier and more convenient.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That should be the mission at hand, and it will very probably pay off handsomely. The same logic applies to food delivery services and other companies: They need to build platforms offering tools that make life easier for the general public or consumer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is why technology is so important and why it really matters. It is not just about getting start-ups to list quickly on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of you may know me as a columnist for the Post, on top of my other responsibilities at the century-old newspaper. I have written several times in my columns - for which I adopt the pen name Mr. Shangkong[http://www.scmp.com/mrshangkong] in homage to my real and adopted hometowns of Shanghai and Hong Kong - that I am not a huge fan of this “get rich quick” culture I see spreading widely in the financial and technology world.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As you are probably well aware, China is full these days of fast-growing start-ups, and many are single-minded in what they hope to achieve: Grow bigger, get more users (or “fans”) and then quickly sell the company off or get it listed so that the co-founders can cash out and move on to the next project.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some VCs and PEs buy into this “quick money” strategy for the sake of their LPs (limited partners) and high investment returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But perhaps the next time you sign a deal, pause to consider what kind of impact you and your business partners can have to make the world a better place, and what your real mission and purpose is or should be.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">﻿It is not every day that a founder of a tech start-up lists enlightenment as one of its goals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chen Man is no ordinary start-up founder. Not yet 40, she has been China's top fashion photographer for the past decade and worked with A-list stars from pop diva Faye Wong to actress Fan Bingbing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She is also an accomplished visual artist[http://www.chenmaner.com/] and one of her most well-known earlier works, The Astronaut, is held by the Victoria and Albert (V&amp;A) Museum in London as part of its permanent collection. Another two works, Long Live the Motherland and Four Seasons: Spring were acquired by the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco in 2015 as part of its permanent collection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these days, in between juggling shoots[https://www.pinterest.com/kcotgrove/chen-man/] and engagements around the world, Chen is also busy with Big Shot (Dapian in Mandarin), a video-editing app that she started two years ago to give the average snapper the tools to produce professional-grade videos. She met with Apple CEO Tim Cook during his visit to China in October and he took part in a video with her using the app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen was taking a swig of warm water to wash down her daily dose of vitamins when the South China Morning Post visited her two-storey studio on the eastern outskirts of Beijing one recent autumn afternoon. The mother of two had just come back from an assignment in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What followed was not a typical interview with a tech start-up founder by any means.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For one, arranging a photography shoot meant carving out an entire morning or afternoon from her packed schedule, because she needed time for make-up and styling. Ditto the suggestion of doing a video shoot using the Big Shot app. In the end, the timings proved too difficult to coordinate, so we settled on a face-to-face meeting, no photos or videos, and she promised to send some images that could be used.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another thing that stood out throughout the hour-long interview, her first since the app's launch in July, was that Chen does not subscribe to the "move fast and break things” philosophy that is prevalent among start-ups. Nor does she believe in "scale up at any costs” in order to grab market share and secure venture capital funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And until she met with the Post, which pitched the interview, she was not all that interested in getting media exposure so that she can attract more attention for the start-up. Neither was she that enamoured with talking metrics, about the start-up's valuation, monetisation strategy or other terms that pass for usual tech-speak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leaning forward on a Chinese traditional horseshoe armchair, Chen explained how her artistic leanings and professional experience have been fused together to create Big Shot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a nod to the user-friendly design approach of one of her tech inspirations, </span><span class="s3">Apple</span><span class="s1">, the app features a clean layout and easy-to-use hand gestures to cut, edit and combine video clips via simple finger swipes or dragging. However, the inspiration behind the app is to create a "spiritual homeland” for China's growing middle class who want to capture vivid and diverse life moments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Users can also apply existing templates or "scripts” shared by others to automatically rearrange and touch up their works - helping with the professional use of captions, filters and combination of different clips into one composition. The hoped-for results are movie-quality video moments of peoples' lives, that can be managed and shared easily with like-minded people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The script mode is one of our original features, and also the first in the world,” said Chen. "Our motto is you are just one click away from becoming a [professional] movie director.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's foray into tech also underlines how the lines between art and tech are blurring, with advances in technology pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her bet on the app will ultimately depend to some extent on the breakthroughs promised by high-speed, high-capacity 5G wireless technologies and beyond, making real time transmission of big data possible, and the continued enthusiasm of young people for innovations in video communication.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it's the underlying philosophy that drives Chen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I believe our physical body is only temporary, while experiences are what shape us ultimately,” Chen says. "Every time a person sits down and edits videos on Big Shot, it should be a journey of self-discovery and reward for past experiences, and optimisation of them for storage, management and sharing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even the decision to shoot from a smartphone's rear or front lens is revealing to Chen, reflecting a person's character and outlook on life.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The rear and front cameras represent two completely different worlds … When users shoot from the back lens, the horizon is outward and much wider,” she says, pointing out how people use other live-streaming and short video apps. "It's no longer a mentality of pleasing others and seeking ‘likes' or rewards with selfies or performance.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And it's this element of enlightenment, or self-enrichment, that Chen wants to emphasise with her new app. She is unabashed about setting it apart from the dozens of short video apps[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2139347/chinas-generation-z-hooked-these-short-video-apps] that have mushroomed in China over the past few years, which lean more towards instant gratification.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Born into a family of artists [her father was a graphic designer], Chen's own childhood and upbringing is a fusion of multiple art forms. She learned painting and calligraphy at the age of three, and initially majored in graphic design before switching to photography. Her photography career took off in 2003 with high-profile covers for Chinese fashion magazine Vision while she was still studying her bachelor's degree at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's latest shoots include a pose of Jackson Yee, a Chinese version of Justin Bieber, slumped in a chair and rolling a pair of walnuts in his palm, and Batman actress Anne Hathaway eating dumplings. It is these kind of life moments that have propelled Chen to create a tool that allows people to capture their own visions in a professional, video format.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even so, the short video scene in China is crowded with not only unicorn start-ups such as ByteDance[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2171702/tiktok-video-platform-vaults-ahead-major-us-social-media-apps-number] and Kuaishou, but also offerings from tech giants including Tencent and Baidu, where eyeballs, traffic, stickiness and viewer time are everything, as they can be transferred to adverts and revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want to create a product that enables a most natural and elevated form of communication, so that users feel rewarded and enriched every time they use it,” she says. "It's easier to build a kill-time app, but that is not my purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even the design of Chen's Beijing studio speaks of her unique visual language. It has a Karesansui [Japanese rock garden] in the courtyard, surrounded by minimalist, white walls. Each room is named after one Chinese character and there's a separate room for meditation. It's simple yet elevating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We return to the theme of how art can inspire or infuse technology and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I believe a good company must be a crossover of humanity and technology,” she says. "The equation that defines me would be the sum of art, humanity and technology.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen says she has always been a techie and a regular attendee of </span><span class="s3">Apple</span><span class="s1">'s Worldwide Developers Conference in recent years. Inside Chen's office, framed photos of her calligraphy and Chinese-styled antique chairs are positioned harmoniously with a Dyson lamp and Xiaomi tread mill. A box of brand-new, state-of-the-art Sennheiser headphones sits unopened on her desk and the doors to adjoining rooms are unlocked via fingerprint sensors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen counts Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Tesla bad boy Elon Musk and Zhang Xiaolong, the mastermind behind China's ubiquitous instant messaging and social networking app </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">, among her idols.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Recalling a recent conversation with Zhang Xiaolong that was supposed to be 10 minutes but lasted for two hours, Chen said the discussion centred on product philosophy. "We both agreed that a good product should put a user's heart at rest instead of catering to human weakness.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elon Musk is an inspiration because of his determination to succeed says Chen, referencing Musk's June letter to staff[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2153343/i-think-we-just-became-real-car-company-elon-musk-celebrates] when he made the difficult decision to lay off 9 per cent of Tesla workers in order to "achieve the mission”. Chen looks a little embarrassed when she admits that she once used Tesla as her profile image on </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our philosophy is a simple one: only create products that the world needs,” says Chen. "We are here to serve all visual language users. This needs no form of translation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's determination to make Big Shot a success means she now shares the workaholic, hard-charging lifestyle of China's new army of tech entrepreneurs - where 996 means working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's only one standard to test your passion for a thing, which is whether you cannot wait to get up each morning,” she wrote in a July letter, after the start-up announced completion of a US$5 million pre-A round of financing led by Kuaishou. Other investors included Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI) and Lighthouse Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, being famous has also afforded Chen the time and space to grow the company in the way she wants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's been no need to rush this, because we believe a good product speaks for itself,” says Chen, who wants to avoid the pitfalls of being a flash-in-the pan fad. "Whether it's the brand, company or product, having an aggressive initial surge and peak may not be very healthy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen says her approach may have something to do with her female identity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Males tend to be linear thinking, making them focus on tasks and specific targets, while female thinking is more like water, which flows, expands and can find new direction,” she said. "I am definitely not setting out to copy the model of a successful, male entrepreneur.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Chen has created a new Weibo account for her role as Big Shot's product manager - loosening the association with her artistic work as she wants the focus to be on how people capture their own life moments - some of which can be so "touching and creative”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want to encourage people to live the world, feel the world, record and share the essence of it, before putting their smartphones away and getting on with their experiences again,” says Chen, estimating that there are as many as 200 million people out there who would be happy to plug into a community with shared tastes and meaningful exchanges.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia, with its population of 240 million, is a key battleground for e-commerce players looking to cater to the country's growing middle-class. But local e-commerce company Bukalapak is eyeing growth by targeting offline consumers - some of whom may not even own smartphones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Jakarta-based company, whose name translates as “open a stall”, is banking on a network of over 300,000 family-run stores to help bring more customers onto its platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bukalapak, which started out as a consumer-to-consumer e-commerce platform similar to Alibaba's Taobao, is one of several e-commerce companies in Indonesia competing for the wallets of customers. Bukalapak allows users to register and open a shop online, and also works with brands to sell products to its consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, with only 55 per cent of the Indonesian population connected to the internet, companies like Bukalapak see the offline space as an important channel to bring more consumers online - even if they do not know how to make payments online or have never engaged in e-commerce before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offline, Bukalapak works with some 300,000 warungs, which are small, family-owned convenience kiosks that sell daily necessities, or restaurants selling local food. Customers without internet experience who want to buy something on Bukalapak can approach warung owners for help in placing their orders online. The buyers then pay cash to the warung for the ordered item.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We're taking the ‘e' out of e-commerce by expanding into the offline space,” said Muhamad Fajrin Rasyid, co-founder and president of Bukalapak. “In reality, only about 10 per cent of Indonesia's population have bought something online before.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This method is one of the ways we're approaching the 90 per cent of the population who have never bought something online,” he said. It is also a win-win situation for the warungs who work with Bukalapak as they receive a small commission for each transaction they help close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the population in Southeast Asia, is often seen as a key market by technology companies looking to expand regionally. The large population of mobile-first users - Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> users in the world and fifth-highest when it comes to </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1"> - and its rising affluence makes it an attractive market for technology companies looking to engage users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indonesia set to tighten noose on online merchants evading tax[https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/2167067/indonesia-set-tighten-noose-online-merchants-evading-tax]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fajrin estimates that Bukalapak has about 15 to 20 per cent of the e-commerce market in Indonesia, where it is locked in a battle with other players like Indonesia's Tokopedia, Lazada and Shopee for market share. After its funding round last November, Bukalapak chief executive Achmad Zaky declared that the company was a unicorn with a valuation exceeding US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company declined to reveal the investors which led its latest round, apart from stating they are local and that Bukalapak will not fall into foreign hands. In August last year Tokopedia raised US$1.1 billion in a funding round led by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, the parent company of the South China Morning Post. Meanwhile, its other rival Lazada became an Alibaba subsidiary after the Hangzhou-based company pumped in US$4 billion and became a controlling shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Bukalapak plays the long game. It recognises that it's still early days in Indonesia and there are still literally millions of people to engage in daily commerce,” said Khailee Ng, managing partner of the 500 Startups' Southeast Asia fund, which was an early investor in Bukalapak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They've raised less money [than competitors] but their traffic and numbers are comparable,” Ng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bukalapak was founded in 2010 after its three co-founders saw how technology could transform the shopping landscape by helping small and medium enterprises sell online. The country's e-commerce industry is still largely classifieds-based where sellers advertise their wares on social media platforms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Instagram</span><span class="s1">, with payment being done by bank transfers from the buyer, Fajrin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To encourage sellers and buyers to use Bukalapak, the company offers an escrow service where it holds a buyer's payment until the item has been shipped and received, before releasing the money to the seller. Fajrin said this approach was inspired in part by Alipay which offered escrow services to improve the trust among Taobao users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fajrin identified payments as the biggest hurdle in e-commerce in Indonesia. While logistics was also a challenge it is not a “stopper” for e-commerce, he added. Instead, the larger discrepancy lies between the number of e-commerce customers versus the larger Indonesian population that are online and on social media platforms, but have yet to make an online purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People understand that Indonesia is an archipelago and to deliver to the different islands will take a few days,” Fajrin said. On the other hand, the low credit card penetration in Indonesia means that many people often have to pay for purchases offline and that is when many e-commerce transactions tend to drop off, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole Corp, a Chinese technology unicorn that makes the world's thinnest full-colour flexible display, unveiled a foldable smartphone on Wednesday, offering a screen the size of an iPad-sized tablet with the ability to fold up so it fits in the palm of your hand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Called the “FlexPai”, it comes with a 7.8-inch high-resolution screen with thickness of 7.6mm, the largest smartphone display size on the market today. But the retail price is also high, with the top end model going for 12,999 yuan (US$1,865), which compares to 8,999 yuan as the starting price for Apple's latest flagship iPhones.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole's lightweight and ultra-thin device, one tenth the weight of an LCD and one fifth the thickness, can be bent more than 200,000 times without breaking because of the materials used, Bill Liu Zihong, 35, co-founder, chairman and chief executive of the company said in Beijing on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is a historical moment we have been waiting for years [to see],” said Liu, who believes the technology will prove popular as it caters to the needs of consumers who want a large display-smartphone that is still easy to carry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meet the Shenzhen billionaire behind the world's thinnest flexible display[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2158864/meet-shenzhen-billionaire-behind-worlds-thinnest-flexible-display]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Royole's foldable phone, believed to be the first on the market, comes at a time when global smartphone brands are already looking for ways to equip flexible displays on their devices as they seek to update current handset designs that have largely remained the same since Apple introduced its first iPhone in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In early September, </span><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1">'s mobile division chief executive DJ Koh said it was “time to deliver” on a foldable device after consumer surveys carried out by the Korean electronics giant showed the market was ripe for such handsets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, China's leading smartphone brand, also revealed in September that it will introduce flexible displays on its next generation 5G handsets and that the new phones will be foldable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the Fifa World Cup in Russia this year, Royole incorporated a high-definition 2K resolution bendable display on hats and T-shirts which could stream content from a user's mobile phone or tablet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen company claims that its flexible screens integrate more than 20 million flexible ultra-precision devices, 6 million flexible integrated circuits, and nearly 100 kinds of micro-nano film materials to support the usage as a smartphone display.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultra-thin flexible display maker Royole raises another US$800m[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2113079/ultra-thin-flexible-display-maker-royole-raises-another-us800m]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new Royole phone, running an </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">'s Android operating system and offering vivid colours and images on the display, also supports dual Sim-cards, fingerprint recognition, fast charging, and artificial intelligence graphics algorithm which can support 5G applications in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new player in smartphone design, Royole has allocated 200 million yuan to encourage developers to work on applications to support the flexible phones, Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The foldable phone, starting from 8,999 yuan for the 6G RAM and 128G storage model, will be available for sale on November 1 from the company's website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The six-year-old start-up, claiming a valuation of US$5 billion after its latest Series E round of funding, has 2,200 employees working in 20 countries. It started operations at its 1.1-million-square-foot production campus in Shenzhen in June this year. The plant will mass produce the fully flexible displays, which can be bent, folded or curled, for commercial use.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why did you specialise in eyewear? “I've always loved sunglasses and have been collecting them since I was young. For me, it was about pursuing a passion. Eyewear is the only fashion accessory that both reveals and conceals at the same time, which means it's fun to play with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I launched, in 2013, there were few brands that specialised in creative eyewear. Today the whole game has changed, with luxury and even small brands offering well-made glasses at competitive prices. Eyewear itself has gone from functional to becoming a fashion statement.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What makes your brand different? “Since the begin­ning, we have tried to think outside the box. This has meant coming up with fun concepts such as our magnetic system, which allows the wearer to play around with their look. Our earliest design was a pair of cat glasses with detachable magnetic ears.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What inspires your designs? “My dreams! I dream about all these characters that don't exist in the real world. Then I take these crazy ideas and try to interpret them in a way that's functional yet different. This has led to styles with unicorn horns and vampire fangs. Our latest design features a magnetic ridge across the top of the frame, to which you can attach any letter of the alphabet and a hashtag.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What are the challenges of being a Hong Kong brand? “We were lucky as we were picked up a few months after we launched, by Colette [in Paris], which was my happiest day ever. Back then, I felt I needed to go back to the United States to launch the brand because it was the only way people would respect us in Asia. Today, things have changed. Thanks to social media, everything and everyone is being drawn closer, which means there are no more boundaries. Where you are based doesn't matter any more as long as you have a great product.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What eyewear trends are you most excited about? “People are talking about such things as augmented-reality glasses but I want to keep the line relatively classic while working around our signature magnetic strip.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past two years, 1990s micro baby glasses have come back, so we've included a few styles in our recent collection. I've also noticed a lot of accessories are popping up, including eyewear chains. We are also seeing sporty trends like the Oakley styles. Eyewear is closer to catwalk trends than ever before.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What next? “Two years ago we did an interesting collaboration with an artist in Los Angeles, who made sunglasses out of ceramics. I loved the fact that it wasn't just commercial and that we were exploring the idea of glasses as wearable art. I want to do more of this!”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One interesting fact came through on </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1"> after the race, with @jdkayll revealing “Friends Of Ka Ying is the only active horse to have raced in a Winx-less Cox Plate”. He ran in the race as a three-year-old in 2014, finishing well down the track behind Adelaide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So clearly ability is not the issue for Friends Of Ka Ying, but attitude is and the champion jockey doesn't want to waste his time with him any more.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rookie is off to a flying start this season and while he probably won't displace John Size as the best trainer in town, he couldn't have done much more in the first four meetings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ting has done a great job with four winners, a second and a third from nine runners to sit second in the trainers' championship behind the guru Tony Cruz.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He is certainly building a reputation as the first race specialist, winning three of the four openers so far, but the 45-year-old is keeping it in perspective.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But his early success will pay dividends with owners, who are always looking for an edge and Ting will be the recipient of more horses (he currently has 43 in work) if he can keep this up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a clear map to follow - the one set by Frankie Lor Fu-chuen last season.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has a high chance of reclaiming a spot in the top three global IPO league table in the second half of the year, with the total capital raised expected to reach as much as HK$140 billion (US$17.8 billion) from a flurry of new economy listings that would include well-known Chinese technology unicorns, according to Deloitte on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The potential pipeline of unicorns and mega listings include smartphone vendor Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] - expected to list soon - and telecoms tower operator China Tower, which has filed a listing application to the Hong Kong stock exchange to raise as much as US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is there enough funding in Hong Kong for multiple unicorn IPOs at the same time?[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2151283/there-enough-funding-hong-kong-multiple-unicorn-ipos-same]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another potential candidate is ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing[https://www.scmp.com/topics/didi-chuxing], reportedly considering a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in the second half and hopeful of securing a valuation of between US$70 billion to US$80 billion. Restaurant review and delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping is also mulling a Hong Kong listing to raise US$6 billion, according to various media reports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Others such as mainland Chinese live streaming platform Yingke has also applied for a Hong Kong listing while rival Douyu TV, backed by Tencent, video and photo-sharing app Kuaishou, and online ticketing provider Maoyan Weiying are considering going public in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ranking in the global IPO league table slipped to No 5 in the first half of the year in the absence of big IPOs, with total funds raised dropping a two-year low of HK$50.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-head Deloitte China's national public offering group, expected Hong Kong to climb back to the top three list in the rest of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Starting July, we are going to see many listings by new economy companies, including some famous Chinese unicorns, thanks to the stock exchange's listing rule changes,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He anticipated at least five mega listings in the second half - each raising more than HK$10 billion - from the so-called new economy sector, like fintech, emerging tech, and consumer industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the year, Au has forecast 180 IPOs to raise a total of between HK$160 billion to HK$190 billion, up 25 per cent to 48 per cent from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where do blockbuster IPOs stand as the fizz goes out of Hong Kong's stock trading debuts?[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2148830/where-do-blockbuster-ipos-stand-fizz-goes-out-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“More than half of this year's IPO fundraising will come from the new economy sector,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months, the consumer sector saw the most number of new listings, making up 33 per cent of the total IPOs, up from the 21 per cent recorded for 2017. By value, the sector accounted for 13 per cent of the total funds raised, up from 3 per cent a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest IPO in the first half was the US$1.1 billion offering by Ping An Good Doctor, a Chinese online medical service platform and a unit of Ping An Insurance Group[https://www.scmp.com/topics/ping-insurance].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi's Hong Kong IPO will launch in July[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2147746/xiaomi-puts-final-touches-us10-billion-ipo-gift-hong-kongs-july]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Au said downside risks included a stronger US dollar that will trigger fund outflows and US-China trade uncertainty[http://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-trade-war] that could dent investor appetite, which will affect the listing window of big IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, Shanghai has also benefited from the massive offering of </span><span class="s3">Foxconn Industrial Internet</span><span class="s1">, which collected US$4.2 billion, the second biggest IPO in the world in the first half. Total funds raised on the </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> reached US$9.4 billion for the first half, ranking it the third among global bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huge number of Chinese tech unicorns likely to IPO in Hong Kong in 2018[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144880/huge-number-chinese-tech-unicorns-likely-ipo-hong-kong-2018-says]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, Au expected the Chinese IPO market to become less active in the second half, as regulators tighten IPO approvals to ensure market stability when Chinese depositary receipts hit the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The number of IPOs could more than halve to 120 to 160 in 2018, while funds raised would correspondingly drop 13 per cent to 26 per cent to 170 billion yuan (US$26.3 billion) to 200 billion yuan for the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“CDRs by big Chinese companies will draw liquidity from the market, and regulators want to maintain the stability and protect small investors from potential wild fluctuations,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The A share market is more fragile, as retail investors account for 90 per cent of the total.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Harry Potter had a holiday home in the Mediterranean, it would look like this 17th-century farmhouse on the Maltese island of Gozo. Named Diagon Alley because of its location in a narrow backstreet, the 4,000 sq ft, four-bedroom house is spread over four floors, linked by staircases that lead off and around a central courtyard. It has castle-like crenellations, uneven walls that are more than one metre thick, a maze of rooms with vaulted ceilings and a cavernous underground swim­ming pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is the third house in the area that ex-Hongkonger Fox Daniels has bought and renovated. She and her husband, Paul, moved to Malta five years ago for a more relaxed pace of life, having had their fill of Hong Kong's bustle. When Diagon Alley came onto the market last year, the couple snapped it up with a view to renting it out as a holiday home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is one of the oldest farmhouses on the island,” says Daniels, an artist and ardent Harry Potter fan. “A Danish couple holidayed in this house for 30 years and decided to sell it because they were too old to travel. It hadn't been updated since they bought it so that became my job.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fortunately, Daniels has a flair for interior design, having renovated several properties, including a house in Yuen Long that she kitted out to look like a 20th-century Shanghainese bordello.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My style is very theatrical and I don't like my homes to follow a standard format,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A guided tour via FaceTime starts on the ground floor, which is level with the main courtyard and houses the kitchen and living and dining rooms as well as the Severus Snape bedroom and en suite bathroom. Each bedroom is dedicated to one of Harry Potter's teachers and is announced by an enchanting black-and-white door sign, inscribed with magical-looking calligraphy. The ancient-looking Albus Dumbledore room is hidden in the basement; and the Minerva McGonagall and Aurora Sinistra bedrooms, both of which have private terraces, are on the first floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I gave the best rooms to the witches,” laughs Daniels.The quality of the light in each house I have worked with dictates its colour. A lot of natural stone can make a house a bit dark so, in addition to the bright colours, I blue-washed the walls to give the house a liftFox Daniels</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A vibrant blue-and-yellow scheme runs through the house - blue to echo the colour of the Maltese sky and to emphasise the house's Moorish roots; and yellow, says Daniels, to embody the joy of holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The quality of the light in each house I have worked with dictates its colour,” she says. “A lot of natural stone can make a house a bit dark so, in addition to the bright colours, I blue-washed the walls to give the house a lift.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Diagon Alley's original structure didn't change, she created a couple of bath­rooms from existing spaces so that three of the bedrooms would have en-suites. She also designed and installed a white Victorian spiral staircase because there was no internal access between the ground and first floors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it was a working farm, the animals were kept in the basement and on the ground floor. The farmer and his family lived on the first floor and didn't want animal sounds and smells wafting up an open staircase,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daniels sourced furniture and finishes from local craftspeople, including Moorish-style tiles that can be seen indoors and out, on floors, arches and walls. She also found boxes of Scandinavian furniture and knick-knacks that had been left behind by the previous owners. With an eye for turning trash into treasure, Daniels gave many of these pieces a lick of yellow paint to match the doors, window frames and custom-made furniture, or turned them into decorative objects. However, she left untouched several features that hinted at the house's former life. There are holes in the living-room walls that once contained iron rings to tie up the livestock; alcoves in the Severus Snape bedroom were originally feeding troughs for bulls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daniels' biggest challenge was the creation of the spectacular Leaky Cauldron swimming pool in the basement. The long, low space had been used to store food and farming equipment, so 47 cubic metres of stone - a volume equivalent to three times the size of the original room - had to be excavated to create sufficient depth for the pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I allocated five days to do it as it wouldn't have been fair on my neighbours to prolong the noise and dust,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A practical kitchenette services another alfresco dining terrace on the second floor; one final flight of stairs takes you up to the rooftop sun deck, from where you can enjoy open sea views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I love the colour and the silence of this place,” says Daniels. “You can fall out of love with a project but that hasn't happened with this one. We live in the next village but even we come here for a break.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Living room The sofa and armchair cost a total of €700 (US$812) from Orienta[http://www.orienta.com.mt/], in Gozo, Malta. The rug, fireplace tools, urns, candleholders, side tables and mirrors all belonged to the house's previous owners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dining room The resin antler ceiling light was €1,000 from Silhouette The Light Shop in Gozo (tel: 356 2155 9048). The candlesticks, vases, easel, dining table, chairs and chest of drawers came with the house. The stone shelf is part of the house's structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kitchen The kitchen cabinetry was given a makeover with yellow paint and new doorknobs. Fox Daniels[http://foxdaniels.net/] replaced all the appliances. The wall clocks, easel and stone wall sconces came with the house while the brass sconces were €90 each from Silhouette The Light Shop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outdoor terrace and kitchenette The teak outdoor table, chairs, parasol and large wicker basket came with the house. The previous owners had used the indoor space as an office but Daniels turned it into a barbecue kitchen and painted the shelves yellow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Swimming pool Named after the wizards' pub in the fictional Diagon Alley, the Leaky Cauldron basement swimming pool is heated year round and lit by atmospheric green lights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Minerva McGonagall bedroom Daniels transformed a walk-in wardrobe into a bathroom alcove and installed a yellow sink unit and mirror, which were made by Gozo carpenter George Grech (tel: 356 2155 3653). He also made the wardrobe and mirror next to it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The black-and-white tiles cost €25 per square metre from Distinct Homes[https://www.distincthomes.com.mt/], in Malta. The armchair was €395 from Orienta and the brass lamp behind it was bought for €30 at a car boot sale. The sconces and hats had been left in the house by its previous owners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Aurora Sinistra bedroom The wrought-iron bed (€350) was custom made and spray-painted by an ironmonger and the blue bedcover and pillows set cost €250 from eBay UK[https://www.ebay.co.uk/]. Daniels bought 20 flat-packed MDF wall-mounted unicorn heads (€30 each) from Etsy UK[https://www.etsy.com/uk/] and scattered them throughout the house. Grech spray-painted them for her. The rug belonged to the house's previous owners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rooftop The rooftop boasts spectacular sea views, on a clear day all the way to Sicily. However, the only way up is via outdoor stairs. The loungers cost £530 (US$702) each from Hayes Garden World[https://www.hayesgardenworld.co.uk/], in Britain. The banana-fibre Alseda floor “stool” (HK$250) is available from Ikea[https://www.ikea.com/hk/en/]. The wrought- iron table and chairs (€180) came from Alfresia[https://www.alfresia.co.uk/], in Britain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tried + tested</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yellow fever Fox Daniels found a yellow version of the traditional beige mosquito netting common in all hardware shops on Gozo, and used it to hide the outdoor air-conditioning units and cover the external doors. To the latter she added fishing nets strung with small buoys, which were given to her by her builder, who is also a fisherman. The netting came from Dominic Department Stores[http://www.ddsmalta.com/].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The blue-and-white porcelain Skyros Deco Blanco tiles (seen in the courtyard and throughout the house) cost €25 per square metre from Meric Interiors (Triq L- Imgarr, Ghajnsielem, Gozo, tel: 356 9947 8562) and the winking sun wall decoration was custom made by Gozo Pottery Barn[http://www.gozopotterybarn.com/].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The object with four bells was found when excavating the basement and is thought to have accompanied the statue of the village saint as it was carried through the streets on feast days.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent-backed live-streaming platform Douyu has been removed from a number of Chinese smartphone app stores. The Wuhan-based answer to Twitch was not available on Apple's China app store on Wednesday and a search of Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> smartphone stores only showed a basic version with limited functionality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. The removal from app stores would prevent new users from downloading the app but not affect existing users.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The app's removal follows a crackdown by Beijing on content it deems inappropriate - which includes “pornography” and “illegal” online content, according to a </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> report in August. Users of live-streaming sites in China now need to register under real names, while platforms should set up a black list of offending broadcasters, and improve vetting mechanisms to guard against illegal or harmful content, </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> said, citing an industry notice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The moves comes as Weibo, China's answer to </span><span class="s3">Twitter</span><span class="s1">, announced it would be stopping any new users registering for its services under 14 years' old.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April, four news apps, including Jinri Toutiao and ifeng News, were removed from app stores for two weeks amid a move by authorities to “clean up” the broadcasting environment. In July, Nasdaq-listed video sharing site Bilibili was pulled for a month after being criticised by state-owned television for inappropriate content. China has now has shut down more than 13,000 websites in the last three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu banned one of its hosts Chen Yifaer in August over comments about the Nanking massacre, a mass murder committed by Japanese troops in 1938, and vowed to have all hosts attend regular patriotic education sessions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese online entertainment portal LeTV has invested US$700 million in car-hailing company Yidao Yongche for a controlling 70 per cent stake, according to media reports[http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/20/yidao-yongche-a-lesser-rival-to-uber-in-china-raises-700m-at-a-1b-valuation/#.q9smht:Xger] this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yidao Yongche isa distant No4 player in the Chinese market with a 2.7 per cent share as of the second quarter of this year, according to Chinese consultancy firm Analysys International. Other analysts say its true share may be as low as 1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also has a presence in over 20 cities in the US and other countries, mainly catering to non-English-speaking Chinese, according to China's state media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The extra funding raises the company's valuation to about US$1 billion, making it another Chinese unicorn,and shows how much faith LeTV has in China's car-hailing market, which is facing regulatory challenges and a backlash from established taxi operators.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese car-sharing services have been spending heavily this year to expand their market reach, but new government regulations may make it harder for them to turn a profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drivers have also complained that the government clampdown is making more of their peers ditch the apps[http://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-gaming/article/1868361/any-one-us-could-be-next-victim-more-chinese-drivers-ditch-car] as their attractiveness wanes and attendant risks multiply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ministry of Transport proposed a new set of rules on October 10 with stricter controls.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The companies must house their servers in China and let the local authorities dictate the fees they charge, the size of their fleet and the areas in which they can operate, among other conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed regulations are open for feedback for a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite these challenges, LeTV, which also sells smartphones in addition to its video site and other interests including robotics,has grand ambitions for its internet car business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said the deal with Yidao Yongche is a crucial next step in its electric car project, after it announced last year that it plans to produce its own electric cars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">LeTV has already struck a deal with British luxury car maker </span><span class="s3">Aston Martin</span><span class="s1"> to provide it with in-car entertainment.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">LeTV has also invested in DZ , a leading company in the field of charging infrastructure for electric cars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A chronic shortage of these charging stations is one of the major hurdles to more widespread adoption of electric cars in China, which the government is promoting with subsidies and other incentives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing will present its 13th Five-Year Plan at a plenum later this month and the building of such stations and the improved efficiency of batteries are expected to be highlighted, according to media reports.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Chong Sing Holdings</span><span class="s1"> FinTech, an online lending and payment operator that has been focusing on China and Southeast Asia, will apply for a virtual banking licence in Hong Kong as it seeks to expand into artificial intelligence-backed wealth management services in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Phang Yew Kiat said with the licence it hopes to operate a virtual bank based on an open platform concept and make its customers' data available to third parties, allowing them to offer their own wealth management and private banking solutions upon customers' consent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chong Sing, which has its headquarters in Hong Kong, is also aiming to make its banking operation “100 per cent paperless”, as it is ready to deploy its own private blockchain to process customers and internal records using the distributed-ledger technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With the use of fintech such as artificial intelligence and robo-advisors we are aiming to deliver better returns to our wealth management clients. Our expectation of better returns comes from the fact that AI can advise clients on their asset allocation decisions, and can do so without the costs involved in maintaining a network of branches,” said Phang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which is listed on the GEM board of the Hong Kong bourse for small to mid-sized companies, is one of at least 50 firms that have so far expressed an interest to the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA) in the new banking licence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They include home-grown unicorn WeLab, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered Bank</span><span class="s1">, and payment operator Yedpay! The HKMA has set August 31 as the deadline for applications, and new licences are expected to be issued around the end of this year or the first quarter of 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By allowing third parties to directly access clients' data and manage their investments and use of funds on its open platform, Phang said Chong Sing is effectively embracing the open banking regulations used in the UK, or the Second Payment Services Directive (commonly known as PSD2) of the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">. Both of these aim to foster more competition and innovation, and to level the playing field for new payment-services providers that have emerged in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes the virtual bank licence will help Chong Sing to spearhead that trend in Hong Kong too. Apart from wealth management and private banking services, the company also plans to offer payment services, such as cross-border money transfer through the virtual bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It plans to acquire its customers through online channels, and support them through smartphone apps and video calls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the virtual banks will only operate online, with no physical branch network, the regulator will require them to have at least one bricks-and-mortar office that can also handle complaints from customers. Phang said it plans to maintain one such customer support centre that will operate for up to 18 hours per day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, </span><span class="s3">Chong Sing Holdings</span><span class="s1"> Fintech offers a wide array of online loans, spanning mortgages, consumer loans, and loans for small enterprises. It claims a registered user base of 73 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Phang was previously a principal director of Standard Chartered private bank, and had served as deputy CEO at </span><span class="s3">China Bohai Bank</span><span class="s1">, in which </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> is the second-biggest shareholder.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There wasn't much talk about shared office space in Shanghai one year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in the interim period, a number of operators and developers have set up co-working office space leasing concepts featuring a chic environment, modern furniture and smart services. The new arrivals include New York-based WeWork, the biggest player in the co-working industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeWork announced last week it plans to set up its regional Asia-Pacific headquarters in Shanghai, according to a report by Shanghai-based Thepaper.cn.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A unicorn startup with 7 million square feet leased in 12 countries, WeWork entered China earlier this year and chose Shanghai as its first stop. The company currently operates three locations in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Shanghai has the largest office stock in China, which means Shanghai has the highest concentration of companies/businesses. Shanghai is also the financial centre of China. Even for small businesses or start-ups, access to capital is vital to their success,” said Joe Zhou, head of research at </span><span class="s3">Jones Lang LaSalle</span><span class="s1"> in China.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While WeWork also expanded into Hong Kong in August, David Ji, head of research and consultancy for greater China at Knight Frank, believes the cheaper rental is the key reason WeWork decided to base the business in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Office supply in Hong Kong is very scarce, the share-based office cost wouldn't be lower than traditional office space, ” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">WeWork declined to comment on the reasons it chose Shanghai for regional headquarters instead of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, co-working space has also grown significantly in Beijing. Between the Chinese capital and Shanghai, more than 500 co-working sites have been set up over the past 18 months, JLL data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UR Work, a Beijing-based co-working space provider founded last year, has seen its market value expand to 5.5 billion yuan following a series-B round of fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 40 sites its has set up since its launch, about half are located in Beijing, while the remainder are spread across nine other cities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UR Work has started strategic cooperation with Alibaba Cloud earlier this year, the cloud serviced arm of China's </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">. Alibaba will provide technical assistance to entrepreneurs using UR Work.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most recently, </span><span class="s3">Longfor Properties</span><span class="s1">, one of the largest mainland developers, also plans to open its first two co-working spaces, in Shanghai and Beijing, by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said it will use the spare spaces at its shopping malls and expects to see the synergies with retailers in the mall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dynamic economic growth in IT and finance and demographic changes, including the two-child policy, will create more opportunities for niche sectors such as co-working space to take hold, said Kenneth Rhee, the Urban Land Institute chief representative for the Chinese Mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies are also switching on to the use of co-working spaces. “More large corporations are increasingly considering co-working options for some of their business units or functions,” JLL's Zhou said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Zhou doesn't expect significant impact on demand for traditional office space, as the coworking community primarily caters to start-ups, freelancers and small businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou cautioned that the dramatic increase in coworking space could wind up increasing office supply, pushing down rental rates and eventually leading to a wave of consolidation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Coworking is not just providing space. The successful coworking operators offer a platform, a community and experience which we found their tenants value most,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alisports in April closed a US$190 million Series A funding round led by Hong Kong-based Yunfeng Capital, which counts Alibaba's Jack Ma as one of its founders. The funding round gave Alisports a valuation of over US$1 billion, making it a unicorn company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company also last month acquired Chinese fitness app Ledongli, which offers a steps tracking app that has amassed over 55 million users as Alisports looked towards expanding its e-commerce offerings and move towards a “new retail” model.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move to a new retail business model is in line with Alibaba's overall strategy. The term “new retail” was first coined by its founder Jack Ma, and the e-commerce giant has since invested in a string of offline retail companies as it looks to better integrate online and offline shopping to provide a better retail experience for consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alisports was established in 2015, with its operations encompassing television and digital sports rights, as well as venue commercialisation and sports event organisation. Over the last two years, Alisports organised the annual World Electronic Sports Games, a global electronic sports tournament with a multimillion dollar prize pool.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese internet companies Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, as well as LeEco, also operate their own sports arms, primarily to obtain exclusive streaming rights to sporting events as they look to carve out a slice of the growing subscription-based entertainment market in China.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed company Grandshores Technology Group, a blockchain investor tied to a 10 billion yuan (US$1.46 billion) global blockchain fund backed by the government of China's Hangzhou municipality, said late on Monday it had appointed China's “bitcoin evangelist”, Li Xiaolai, as its co-chief executive and executive director.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said in a stock exchange announcement that Li, known for founding Bitfund, a bitcoin-focused venture capital fund in China that at its peak had 3.8 billion yuan in assets under management, will lead various projects at Grandshores. One of these will be a “stablecoin” pegged to the yen. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, such as gold or a hard currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Mr Li will mainly be responsible for various projects in which the company is taking part, including the establishment of a stable digital currency system (focusing on mainstream international currencies),” the company said in its announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores is aiming to launch the yen stablecoin by February 2019, sources close to the company said on Tuesday. Its chairman, Yao Yongjie, has previously said it would also explore stablecoins pegged to the Hong Kong and Australian dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, there is a growing demand within the cryptocurrency community for stablecoins, which are being used for the settlement of cryptocurrency-denominated trades. Traders prefer stablecoins to fiat currencies because of their faster settlement time. Stablecoins are also often viewed as providing price stability, especially during periods of cryptocurrency market volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, 46, an English-language teacher before his career in bitcoin and blockchain start-up investment, graduated from Changchun University with a degree in industrial enterprise accounting. His other blockchain investment vehicle is INBlockchain, which has invested in leading blockchain projects such as EOS.IO, an open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralised blockchain applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li's term is unspecified and he will hold office at least up until the company's next annual general meeting, expected in August 2019. In its exchange announcement, Grandshores also said his pay will be determined by its remuneration committee and board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, Hurun, the Shanghai-based publishing group that compiles the lists of China's wealthiest individuals, estimated Li's net worth at 7 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grandshores has been positioned as an international launch pad for the Hangzhou Grandshores Fund. It is expected to help the backers of its affiliated mainland fund invest globally into blockchain start-ups with the potential of becoming the next blockchain unicorn, or private company valued at more than US$1 billion. Li is also one of the founders of the Hangzhou Grandshores Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's other co-CEO is Wang Qian, 30, formerly a fund manager with Grey Investment in Hong Kong. Shares in Grandshores closed 22.6 per cent higher at HK$1.25 on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yao and Li could not be immediately reached for comment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How can a medium-sized Nordic nation with a population smaller than Hong Kong grow more start-ups than any other country in the world?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ilkka Paananen, founder of the world's No.1 mobile game company Supercell, believes Finland's unique business culture makes all the difference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think the Finnish culture is to get things done, although we don't talk too much," Paananen said this week during a group interview at the company'sheadquarters in Helsinki.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Supercell is behind many of the world's most popular game titles including Clash of Clans, Boom Beach and Hay Day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paananen, who serves as chief executive of the technology company, gave six major reasons why Finland is becoming one of the world's top countries for start-ups to get up and running successfully.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the struggles that </span><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1">, formerly one of Finland's biggest success stories, has encountered in recent years in adapting to the smartphone era, new companies are flourishing in this sparsely populated country of 5.5 million (Hong Kong's population hovers around 7 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/images/methode/2015/11/11/c66ca10c-883c-11e5-9598-b94cb5b90839_image_hires.jpg?itok=KZ90u189]</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is no small talk in the country, so there is no guessing [among colleagues and partners] when we do business," said Paananen, who began his career in computer gaming right after graduation.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a "great work culture" bolsters efficiency and helps Finnish entrepreneurs and their teammates quickly turn their businesses into a success, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He made a point of comparing this to the high level of bureaucracy that can often tie up companies elsewhere in Europe and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Finland is a very small country ... so in many cases we know everybody [in a company] and there is less management needed, so we can be very efficient," she said earlier this week.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SLUSH, Europe's biggest start-up conference, is taking place in the Finnish capital this week with the support of the country's foreign ministry and other government agencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other factors that have made the country stand out in recent years include a strong reservoir of technology talents, including many experienced programmers and engineers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also praised Finland's education system for helping shore up and attract talent. It has been ranked as "the world's best" by the well-respected education industry standard Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is backed by the </span><span class="s3">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</span><span class="s1">?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paananen noted that after Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia in mid-2013[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1302434/microsoft-acquire-nokias-handset-business-hk557b], many former </span><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> employees, including many outstanding </span><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> developers, went on to start their own businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> used to ranks as the world' s largest mobile phone maker before it was superseded by Apple when the latter's iPhone redefined the industry landscape.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nokia</span><span class="s1"> may no longer be considered the biggest source of Finland's national pride, but many former staffers are now key drivers behind local start-ups and industry innovation in new business areas. Some have been by Paananen to work on new projects at Supercell.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-ups have taken off around the world in recent years and especially in China, with homegrown companies like car-hailing app </span><span class="s3">Didi Kuaidi</span><span class="s1"> valued at US$16 billion and drone maker DJI, which controls over 70 per cent of the global marker for civilian drones, now worth at least US$10 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the Chinese mainland ranks as the world's No.2 economy and the world's largest and fastest-growing internet market, Hong Kong is also keen to play a leading role in new technological advances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After years of delay, the city's new Innovation and Technology Bureau[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1877615/hong-kongs-new-innovation-and-technology-bureau-absorb-two] was approved last week by local legislators. Part of its aim is to help Hong Kong, which for decades has been known as one of the world's leading financial hubs, transform its economic structure by growing more start-ups with the aim of churning out so-called "unicorn" enterprises valued at US$1 billion or higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paananen, also one of the richest young business leaders in Europe, chose not to directly compare Finland with other countries in terms of their respective business environments for start-ups. But he noted how the strong English-speaking environment and high standard of living in the Nordic welfare state have also helped drive the success of new companies.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adopting a new mindset is also important, he said, as more Finnish people now have very different views on new businesses like mobile gaming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I graduated and began my first job in the mobile game business, many people would still ask me when I can find a ‘real job'," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Now that's certainly changing," he added, noting the game business has already become one of the major tax contributors bolstering Finland's economic growth.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Advanced manufacturing and smart transport are two one-time traditional industries that have been transformed by technological advances, for which Asia has become the global hub. Real estate could be next. For the first time in over a century, the way we build, buy and manage property is changing in response to new technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And while the "proptech” sector emerged in recent years in Western markets on the strength of new technology, the next chapter in the transformation of construction and property management is likely to take place in Asia - if it succeeds in leveraging cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced materials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proptech, or property technology, came to the fore as a major technology sector last year. Proptech companies raised US$12.6 billion last year, a 200 per cent increase from 2016. WeWork and </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1"> became two of the three most valuable start-ups in the United States. A dozen more proptech companies also passed the billion-dollar valuation threshold to achieve unicorn status.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the investors behind these companies ranged from blue-chip funds like </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Ford Foundation</span><span class="s1"> to some of the world's largest landlords and commercial brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US proptech fund Fifth Wall attracts Hong Kong, Asian interest[https://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2159126/us-proptech-fund-fifth-wall-attracts-strong-interest-hk]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rush of activity, however, was largely limited by technology and geography. Existing technologies like shared economy solutions and listing platforms dominated the funded companies. Little capital was deployed to start-ups driven by more sophisticated digital technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, the capital was focused in Western markets, with companies in the US and UK representing more than 70 per cent of deal activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How proptech is changing Hong Kong's property industry[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145546/how-proptech-changing-hong-kongs-property-industry]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both these limitations are now disappearing. The money in proptech is attracting the best technology. New start-ups are increasingly founded by software and engineering PhDs rather than exclusively real estate veterans. And technology ecosystems like Israel now boast vibrant proptech sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Given the global nature of property markets, we expect real estate centres in New York, London and increasingly Dubai, Hong Kong and Shanghai to link with technology hubs like Israel to create future unicorns. This trend is already under way, as some of proptech's most innovative companies - WeWork, Compass, Selina - were founded in international property markets by Israeli entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second missing ingredient in proptech - Asian markets - is also now coming into play. Investors and property groups in Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China and the Gulf have been moving quickly in recent months to stimulate the local proptech ecosystems. The global real estate broker JLL opened offices in Hong Kong for a dedicated proptech fund and in Singapore, JLL partnered with Lendlease to open the region's first proptech accelerator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore construction conglomerate Woh Hup assigned its investment subsidiary Aurum to focus on proptech opportunities. Venture capital funds dedicated to proptech are arriving in Hong Kong and Beijing[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145546/how-proptech-changing-hong-kongs-property-industry]. These firms may be joined soon by Asia's leading sovereign wealth funds. </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</span><span class="s1"> are reportedly considering following the example set by Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund, which invested heavily in SoftBank's proptech-driven Vision Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will a Saudi scandal cloud SoftBank's US$100 billion grand vision?[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2169321/will-saudi-arabias-unfolding-scandal-cloud-us100-billion-vision-softbanks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Asian proptech investors may have looked to the West for inspiration, the market for the new technologies is in their backyard. The scale of Asia's construction output is outpacing the entire construction output of the US and Europe. The importance of regional infrastructure expansion is headlined by ambitious government policies such as China's Belt and Road Initiative[https://www.scmp.com/topics/belt-and-road-initiative]. Moreover, Asian building regulations are generally far less onerous than Western standards - and yet more receptive to futuristic technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While "smart city” is often treated as a buzzword in Western markets, in Asia the term serves as a blueprint for projects as far afield as the futuristic planned city of Neom in Saudi Arabia and the Smart Nation urban planning programme in Singapore. For proptech, this provides an unparalleled entry point to grow on the back of Asia's accelerating and tech-friendly construction boom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When proptech emerged in 2016, the excitement was in the opportunity to disrupt an industry that was among the last to embrace technology. But the real revolution in proptech will take place when today's most advanced technologies are applied to construction and real estate in the fast-growing and technology-friendly markets in Asia and the Gulf. That revolution is now under way.</span></p>

The attack prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy to halt training programmes for the Afghan military and threaten to pull French forces out of Afghanistan earlier than planned.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On a hot summer's day in the hip district of Kreuzberg in Berlin, 28-year-old Simon Specka is closeted indoors with his team of 40 staff members facing an array of computer screens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huddled in an office in a century-old industrial building with neither air-conditioning nor an electric fan, they are trying to create the next-generation of internet security software. They make no attempt to wipe away the sweat soaking their sideburns. Their damp shirts clinging to their backs do not seem to bother them either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We want to make an impact on the world," says Specka, who three years ago co-founded ZenGuard, the Berlin-based tech start-up behind ZenMate, a software encrypting internet users' connection information and transmitted data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The software has bagged over 13 million users around the world in just three years. In Asia, nearly 200,000 have subscribed to the software that generates a virtual private network to keep secret who an individual is communicating with and information contained in the message.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Creating a better world, a vision for the future is our driving force," says Specka.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His motto is also a mantra resounding across the vibrant tech start-up scene in the German capital that has been dubbed Europe's "Silicon Alley" - one of the continent's hottest tech start-up hubs being billed as on its way to being the next Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Berlin might have been scarred by the history of a divided Germany. But today, a quarter of a century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it has become a creative Mecca drawing young entrepreneurs, artists and tech savvy talents from all over the world to realise their start-up dreams.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The German capital is home to some of the world's best-known start-ups such as online audio distribution platform </span><span class="s3">SoundCloud</span><span class="s1">, which was founded by a Swedish team.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The buzz in Berlin has caught the attention of venture capitalists and investors worldwide, including those from Hong Kong and the mainland. In April this year, Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures struck a six-digit-euro deal with Berlin-based start-up Jobspotting. On July 13, a delegation of 30 Chinese family business owners and investors looking for investment opportunities attended an event in Berlin to hear business pitches from tech start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traditional German corporations such as </span><span class="s3">Lufthansa</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Volkswagen</span><span class="s1"> are tapping into youngsters' minds for business inspiration by sponsoring events such as hackathons. </span><span class="s3">Lufthansa</span><span class="s1"> also recently established the "</span><span class="s3">Lufthansa</span><span class="s1"> Innovation Hub" in Berlin to scout for and build start-ups and digital companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/2015/07/23/26061964ce104c3f5a7c4beb75e83c4e.jpg]Official statistics show that investment in Berlin tech start-ups rose from €123.4 million (HK$1 billion) in 2012 to €136.2 million euros in 2013 - three times more than the €45.7 million invested in Bavaria, Germany's largest state that ranked second in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When Germany was still separated, Berlin was economically isolated. West Berlin had little space for manufacturing activities. East Berlin, on the other hand, was full of broken infrastructure," says Alex Jansen, a Berlin-based consultant for start-ups including ZenGuard and </span><span class="s3">Native Instruments</span><span class="s1">, the developer of hardware and software for music production used by top bands such as Kraftwerk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jansen says after reunification, more cheap spaces opened up for artists and creative talents who were already settling in the former West Berlin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Low rent became a comparative advantage for Berlin in transforming itself into a hub for artists and new businesses to try their innovative ideas at a low cost, says Jansen. According to data aggregator Numbeo, consumer prices in Berlin are 35 per cent lower than in London. And rent in Berlin is 72 per cent lower than in the British capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a conducive environment has helped to fire up the creative scene, says Jansen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One example is the three Samwer brothers, who in 2007 founded </span><span class="s3">Rocket Internet</span><span class="s1">. The internet company, though criticised for cloning successful business models from abroad, floated on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange last year and had a market capitalisation of €5.91 billion as of mid-July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Berlin start-up scene is supported by a thriving ecosystem. Jansen says that while the federal government offers various funding schemes to young entrepreneurs as seed money, the private sector also offers loans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some big companies also take on the role of accelerator. One of them is media giant </span><span class="s3">Axel Springer</span><span class="s1">'s Plug and Play Accelerator, offering start-ups an incubation programme, funding and global networking opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It all looks promising on paper. But according to insiders, there's still a long way to go before Berlin start-ups go truly global and become unicorns - companies that boast a valuation of US$1 billion or above. According to Fortune's The Unicorn List, online food ordering service </span><span class="s3">Delivery Hero</span><span class="s1"> is the only Berlin-based start-up on the list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Maks Giordano, managing partner and co-founder of creative strategist Kreait, says that while Berlin has the right environment for start-ups, it still lags far behind Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The business-cloning culture in Berlin, he says, makes it even harder to generate unique and original business ideas that can rival the big guns in the US. "Most innovation still resides in the US," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a global ranking last year of cities with the most tech start-ups set up in the past decade that had gone global or received huge investments, California's Silicon Valley was top with 201 start-ups, followed by New York with 144 and London with 90.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Berlin had 27, ahead of Bangalore, India (26) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (21).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expanding overseas has yet to be top of the agenda for many Berlin start-ups, Giordano says. Many are too busy focusing on making it big in Germany, which is quite a big market, he says. "They need to make the German market work first before going international," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, those with ambition recognise the need to go global, and exploiting the massive potential of China's market remains one of the ultimate goals. But there are huge obstacles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"People are very cautious," says Giordano, citing cultural differences and language barriers among the many problems. The protection of intellectual property is the crux of the issue. Stories of mainland Chinese factories ripping off foreign designs and making local versions of their own are often heard in the business world, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Hong Kong and the mainland offer Berlin start-ups major opportunities for fund-raising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Funds from mainland China and Hong Kong are looking outwards," says Holger Weiss, CEO of Berlin-based start-up Aupeo! He adds that he has met managers of Chinese funds that were keen on finding out more about Berlin start-ups. "They are looking for another unicorn," he says</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jansen says while the mainland remains "interesting" to many start-ups, many of them have no idea how to approach the market. "Market intelligence services would be necessary for start-ups hoping to go to China," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Specka says his company's service was previously available to mainland users. But about a year and a half ago, ZenMate was blocked by Beijing, and the company has yet to identify a solution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Specka is not giving up just yet. "There are plenty of serious venture capitalists in Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong might be very expensive to operate a business but you can make money much faster there," he says.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anthony Tan knew it was not going to be your usual business meeting when the taxi fleet boss he had arranged to meet in the Philippines entered the restaurant surrounded by burly bodyguards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I remember thinking, Manila is hot, why is everyone wearing a jacket and sunglasses at night? What is going on?” said Tan, co-founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia's most valuable tech start-up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan was there to sign up the taxi-fleet owner to his ride-booking app. Midway through the negotiations, there was a loud thud. He peered under their table and saw what looked like a machine gun on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I was like, holy cow, I guess this negotiation is going in your favour!” It was only later that Tan realised he had just sat across the table from one of the area's biggest arms dealers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan laughed as he recounted the early days of Grab to the South China Morning Post at its swanky new headquarters at Marina One West in Singapore's downtown business district. Occupying two floors with expansive views of the busy Tanjong Pagar port, both Grab's new digs and Tan's anecdote underscore how far the start-up he founded with fellow Harvard MBA classmate Tan Hooi Ling [no relation] has come from its beginnings in a cramped garage in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since its inception almost six years ago Grab has fought off no-holds barred competitors such as US-based Uber to lead the region's ride-hailing market. Grab has morphed into Southeast Asia's most valuable tech start-up with a valuation of over US$10 billion, giving Tan a personal fortune of around US$300 million, according to a Forbes estimate made before the latest fundraising round.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ctrip's female CEO on gender inequality and fighting internet platform companies[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2156661/ctrips-female-ceo-gender-inequality-and-fighting-internet-platform]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Southeast Asia, with its population of about 660 million, has long been seen as the next big market for tech companies - the ride-hailing business alone is forecast to be worth more than US$20 billion by 2025, according to a report on Southeast Asia's internet economy released by </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1"> in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, Grab operates in 225 cities across eight countries and boasts over 100 million app downloads. What started out as a taxi-booking app to help keep both drivers and riders safe has evolved to include bookings for private cars, bicycles, shuttle buses and now delivery services for food, parcels and groceries. To tie all of its services together, it also launched mobile payments service GrabPay in 2016, making payments for services more convenient and incentivising users to make in-store purchases in exchange for reward points. The company is expected to generate US$1 billion in revenue for 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dressed in a black polo T-shirt and charcoal slacks, Tan has a warm, approachable manner and his speech is peppered with colloquialisms common to Singapore and Malaysia. But Tan's down-to-earth manner belies his well-heeled background - before founding Grab, the 36-year-old was better known as a scion of a prominent Malaysian family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Singapore, a preview of the clash to come between Grab and Go-Jek[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2149640/singapore-preview-how-grab-and-go-jek-will-likely-face-across-southeast-asia]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I first met Anthony at a [Harvard] business school event. He was super well-dressed, very extroverted and knew all the right people in the room,” said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anthony Tan is the youngest of three brothers born to Tan Heng Chew, president of Tan Chong Motor, which assembles and distributes </span><span class="s3">Nissan</span><span class="s1"> cars across Southeast Asia. His father believed in the school of “tough love” though and so the younger Tan was put to work on an assembly line and accompanied his father to meetings with tough union bosses, which opened his eyes to a different world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At first I had the typical preconception [of him as a rich man's son],” said Hooi Ling. “But when I got to know him, I was super impressed with Anthony's work ethic. He is one of the most hardworking individuals I have ever met … despite the natural advantages he has from his family.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foo Jixun, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV, which led Grab's US$15 million Series B round of financing, said he found Tan's passion interesting, especially since he was born with the proverbial “silver spoon in his mouth” and did not necessarily have to prove anything.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The idea for Grab (originally known as </span><span class="s3">MyTeksi</span><span class="s1">) was conceived when the two Tans happened to sit next to each other during an MBA class. While ride-hailing companies at the time, such as Uber and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, focused on providing better matching of supply and demand for rides, Anthony and Hooi Ling had a different starting point - improving safety.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The safety of Malaysia's taxi industry at the time left much to be desired. There were some bad eggs among the taxi drivers, and it was giving the entire industry a bad reputation. “Hooi Ling experienced the pain for herself. When she was a consultant at McKinsey she'd finish work late at night and would have to pretend to be on the phone with her mother [while in the taxi as a safety precaution],” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Armed with an innate understanding of some of the dangers of single travel in the region, Grab allowed passengers to share the progress of their rides, in real-time, with someone else as a safety precaution. Soon after, it followed in Uber's footsteps by including number masking between drivers and passengers to protect user privacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, in a major broadening of its business, Grab announced that it would be opening its platform to third-party service providers as part of a push to build an everyday app that can provide a wide array of services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab to open on-demand services platform to third-party providers[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2152176/grab-include-third-party-providers-quest-build-everyday-app]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To find partners for its open platform, Grab has started a venture capital arm, and intends to beef up its financial services offerings to serve the underbanked in Southeast Asia. It has even moved into artificial intelligence, partnering with the </span><span class="s3">National University of Singapore</span><span class="s1"> to analyse user data and explore ways of improving mobility across the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, Grab has a list of shareholders that reads like a 'who's who' in the on-demand services industry and Tan can tap business leaders including </span><span class="s3">SoftBank Corp</span><span class="s1">.'s Masayoshi Son, Cheng Wei of China ride-hailing giant </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi for advice.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/28/33e596f8-9177-11e8-9656-94877fce2da3_image_hires_095200.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan recently went to Japan to meet with Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, which invested US$1 billion in the start-up. His early venture capital backers include San Francisco-based 500 Startups and Singapore's </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1">-owned </span><span class="s3">Vertex Ventures</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But none of it could have been possible without one particular investor - Anthony Tan's mother, Khor Swee Wah. Tan, who had worked as a marketing director for Tan Chong Motor before starting Grab, first brought the idea for the taxi-booking app to his father, who dismissed it and urged him to stay in the family business. His mother, wanting to be supportive, put in ‘several millions' to help Tan get things off the ground and accompanied him to investor meetings in the early days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With a rock star list of investors behind him and a green field of opportunity ahead, things have “gained traction” says Tan, being careful not to use the word success. “What is success? There's no end point. We will always find ways to disrupt ourselves,” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not everything has been plain sailing though and he is momentarily stumped when asked about challenges. “Every day is a challenge,” he says, glancing at his PR team across the room.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What he doesn't mention, until asked, is the recent dressing down Grab received from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, which accused the company of reducing competition after it took over Uber's Southeast Asian operations in a merger deal in March. “There's plenty of competition and we will make our representations known to the commission,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There's also the spectre of increased rivalry with Indonesia's Go-Jek, helmed by fellow Harvard MBA classmate Nadiem Makarim and which has set out ambitious plans to expand outside its home market, setting it on a collision course with Grab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek steps up rivalry with Grab as it expands in Southeast Asia[https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2152604/indonesias-go-jek-sees-lot-experimentation-it-expands-fight-grab]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two companies are in a battle for investors as well as customers - Grab and Go-Jek count Chinese tech unicorns </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Meituan-Dianping</span><span class="s1"> as investors respectively. Go-Jek's latest funding round values it at about US$5 billion. At the mention of Go-Jek, Tan trots out an oft-used line: “We welcome and embrace competition, because it's easy to re-anchor ourselves on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan and Makarim met at Harvard and were once close - Tan is said to have considered taking an early stake in Go-Jek when Makarim founded the business in Indonesia. But the two drifted apart as it became apparent that they would become competitors. The companies now seldom send executives to attend a conference or forum if the other party is present.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Until recently, Go-Jek operated only in its home market Indonesia, but has since announced plans to launch units in Thailand and Vietnam. Although the company is in fewer markets than Grab, Go-Jek offers more services, making it an interesting test case of whether it is wiser to build the platform suite of services before venturing into different markets, or to gain a foothold in different markets first before tackling more services. Go-Jek said this year that it has earmarked US$500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Go-Jek did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its competition with Grab.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Grab, like other start-ups that have reached a certain stage of development, is to decide on how to maintain initial growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Every big start-up, from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, Tencent to Alibaba, considers whether to build, buy, partner, or invest as it grows its footprint - and getting that right can be quite a journey,” said Khailee Ng, partner at 500 Startups, which made an early-stage investment in Grab in 2014. “This is the current phase Grab is in.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">True dominance of China's Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent revealed - and how their influence extends worldwide[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2154437/true-dominance-chinas-baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-revealed-and-how]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Managing an aspirant multinational company also requires different skills from running a scrappy start-up. This contrasts with the early days when everyone would “know when someone goes to the toilet because we were all sitting at one table, just the few of us,” says Tan. Grab now has 5,000 staff across the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When hiring, Tan says Grab looks for people with four attributes that the company has codified into guiding principles, namely: Hunger, Humility, Honesty and Heart. “We have made bad hires and learned from it,” said co-founder Tan Hooi Ling in a recent interview in Hong Kong. “We don't want to hire brilliant jerks.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Like many business founders, Tan has had to make the hard decisions to bring in more experienced, external talent when needed, placing them above some of the people who he started out with, says Chua Joo Hock, managing partner of </span><span class="s3">Vertex Ventures</span><span class="s1">, which invested in Grab in April 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab's ‘pay it forward' moment takes a page from mentor Softbank[https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2149306/grabs-co-founder-launches-venture-capital-arm-help-start-ups-avoid]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many start-up founders aren't able to make that step up, but Anthony has and that's credit to him,” said Chua. “He's very down-to-earth and truly wants to help people in the lower strata and is one of the rare founders in this part of the world who really understands the problems faced and can rally people to [believe in his vision].”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These days, both co-founders spend most of their time on the road. Anthony Tan frequently visits Indonesia, a vast archipelagic nation with around 260 million potential consumers, recently stopping by 18 shopping malls in one day to check out the adoption of GrabPay, the company's mobile payments wallet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/28/340d757e-9177-11e8-9656-94877fce2da3_image_hires_095200.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anthony Tan said that his personal faith, as a Christian, guides his actions and also how the company operates. A principle such as servant leadership is a core influence at the company. “If Jesus can wash his disciples' feet, then who am I?” said Tan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Grab has been aggressive when dealing with rivals though.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First there was EasyTaxi backed by </span><span class="s3">Rocket Internet</span><span class="s1">, then there was global leader Uber, whose founder Travis Kalanick took its bruising approach to markets outside the US. Like Grab's shareholder </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, the company was able to fight Uber to a standstill until it had a change of direction under new CEO Khosrowshahi. Grab took over Uber's Southeast Asian operations earlier in March, after the two companies reached an agreement to stop bleeding money in a subsidy war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Up until this point Grab had cultivated a good relationship with regulators, maintaining regular communications and striving to demonstrate how its presence in a market can be beneficial for society. Grab has also tailored its products to suit local markets. However, Singapore's competition watchdog is now examining Grab's dominance, noting a sharp reduction in the incentives customers and drivers used to receive when there was fierce competition between Uber and Grab.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One Grab private-car driver of around four years the Post spoke to said he used to be able to get S$1,000 (US$735) in driver incentives per month but now that had shrunk to about S$200 with more strings attached. Still, he admitted that he owed his job to ride-hailing apps like Grab.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All this seems a long way from the Kuala Lumpur garage where it all began. Tan recalls knocking on taxi windows to convince drivers who brought in their cars for repairs to download Grab's early app.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Uncle give us a chance lah, your income is sure to increase!” Tan recalls saying. “We were basically begging,” he says. “Maybe out of 10 drivers I pitched, two would agree to try it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the interview draws to a close, we ask Tan what his exit strategy is. “There is none. I'm all in,” he says. “This is all I know. I was born in Southeast Asia, this is my home. I will live and die here.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For more than 100 years, during the fourth month of the lunar calendar, residents of Cheung Chau have honoured the god Pak Tai to appease the wandering spirits of plague victims who died during the Qing dynasty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The island's residents ate vegetarian food and lit incense at the intricate Pak Tai Temple. Local men built three towers of steamed buns for a climbing competition while children, dressed as legendary heroes, were suspended on steel frames and appeared to float above the crowd's heads.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fixing the Cheung Chau bun festival in May on Buddha's birthdate and resuming the bun competition in 2005 after it had been halted for safety reasons have helped lure 40,000 visitors annually to the island. That's made the Cheung Chau bun festival one of Hong Kong's great cultural treasures that the city hopes to preserve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the popularity of the three-day carnival, which nearly doubles the population of the 2.46 sq km island each year, has also turned off natives such as Lai Tai-sing and his wife, Chan Kam-mui. During the festivities, they stay locked inside their public housing apartment, finding the event irrelevant.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's true that tourists make the island more vibrant and bring business to local shops," said the 49-year-old Lai. "The festival has little to do with us now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, the annual event joined China's national list of intangible cultural heritage - artefacts that include performing arts, skills, rituals, crafts and festivals, and that differ from physical heritage items such as buildings and possessions. Inclusion on the list wins national and possibly worldwide recognition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Safeguarding such traditions has become a global fashion, thanks to the advocacy of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (</span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">). Hong Kong got swept up in the trend, embarking in 2009 on a four-year survey of the city's cultural traditions. The result was the city's first inventory of intangible cultural heritage published in June, cataloguing 480 entries in hopes of keeping traditions alive, said Liu Tik-sang, director of the University of Science and Technology's South China Research Centre, which conducted the survey.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is a dilemma. To sustain cultural heritage that's at risk of disappearing, cash and resources are needed. Promotions help bring visitors and money. But overexposure can commercialise a tradition, turning it into tourism spectacle and severing its ties to the local community.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Community life and the community's sense of belonging are most important to intangible cultural heritage," said Liu, a cultural anthropologist. "But when a tradition becomes a show for tourists, it is taken out of context and loses its original meaning to the community."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is a treasure island of Chinese tradition. Civil wars, the second world war and the cultural revolution destroyed swathes of important customs over the last century, Liu said. After Chinese fled to Hong Kong, such traditions thrived and were preserved under colonial rule.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> lists 327 intangible cultural heritage items - from Albanian iso-polyphony music to Zimbabwe's Mbende Jerusarema dance. Thirty-eight traditions from China made the worldwide list, including those that thrive in Hong Kong: Cantonese opera, acupuncture and moxibustion, or heat application, used in traditional Chinese medicine.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 1982 </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> conference vowed to protect all forms of cultural items, especially in communities affected by colonialism, war and globalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worldwide recognition of a song or a craft brings prestige to a local community, Liu said. The item's mention raises people's awareness, which can, of course, become a form of promotion and drive preservation efforts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To reach the global list, a tradition such as the Cheung Chau bun festival must manoeuvre a bureaucratic route.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong began asking the public in 2006 to nominate traditions worth preserving. The 480 items correspond to the </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> guidelines. Released in June, the list includes Hakka Chinese and Cantonese, as well as techniques for making pineapple buns, shrimp paste and Hong Kong "silk stocking" milk tea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To get on the national list, an item must be nominated by the provincial or SAR government, which then submits it to the Ministry of Culture for vetting based on cultural and historical values and urgency for preservation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The national recognition is important. For a Hong Kong tradition to get </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> recognition, it must appear on the national list, as </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1"> accepts Chinese submissions only from Beijing. The national list also includes the Tai Hang fire dragon dance, the Tai O dragon boat water parade, and the Yu Lan ghost festival of the city's Chiu Chow community.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government submitted four other items to Beijing last year - the Quanzhen temples' Taoist ritual music; Wong Tai Sin belief and customs; the crafting of guqin, a seven-stringed plucked instrument; and the Hakka unicorn dance in Hang Hau. A decision on these has yet to be announced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Items from the city's inventory - to be listed online by the year's end - will be reviewed, said Florence Hui Hiu-fai, the city's undersecretary for home affairs, for future submissions. After the Hong Kong list is firm, the proposals to Beijing will come from there. It's not certain how many items will be chosen, Hui said, but those that have high cultural value and that face endangerment will receive priority.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benefits of getting national or international recognition can be immense.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Heritage sites and items lure money. The traditional dress of cheongsam - a figure-hugging outfit with a stiff collar - has inspired contemporary designers, drawing interest from youth. Food items such as egg tarts and cha kwo, or steamed sticky rice dumpling, introduce people to Hong Kong heritage, Hui said. Cultural tours that take visitors past heritage sites attract tourists.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And such items can lure much-needed philanthropy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong provides no designated funding for most intangible heritage preservation. Cantonese opera, which is on </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">'s list, is an exception. The government's Cantonese Opera Development Fund, started in 2005, channelled HK$9.8 million into 57 programmes in fiscal year 2013-14. The Lord Wilson Heritage Trust, founded by the government in 1992, subsidised 157 community projects at HK$41.6 million as of March last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2012-13, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Jockey Club</span><span class="s1"> Charitable Trust financed a study project with HK$359,000 of the Yu Lan ghost festival in the Chiu Chow community and paid HK$354,000 to help put on last year's Cheung Chau bun festival.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the growth of creative industries and cultural tourism can lead to commercialisation, which worries proponents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu said practices and rituals are performed to connect people with a community - for a community - not outsiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's promotion should be respectful, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, fishermen's laments traditionally sung for families at weddings and funerals to honour dead relatives should not become paid shows for tourists as that would be disrespectful, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government's effort to catalogue these perhaps fading traditions is important, he said. The elderly practitioners are dying, and younger generations of indigenous inhabitants have left their rural homes, severing their roots to attend elite schools and find well-paying jobs in the city centre. "If you can't sustain the local economy, you can't sustain [the heritage]," Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Resources, he said, should be given to local communities - either money or priority land use - so that the residents can carry on the traditions, rather than transforming their heritage into a tourism spectacle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Cheung Chau, tourists and the money they spend are vital for the dumbbell-shaped island. "Cheung Chau needs money," said Yung Chi-ming, a life-long resident of the island and chairman of the Bun Festival organising committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yung, who also chairs the island's Rural Committee, said that each festival costs more than HK$1 million to stage and fund-raising has been difficult in years past. He said the local economy soured in the early 2000s and few people visited Cheung Chau. "People moaned about the bad business," Yung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the bun festival's success in bringing tens of thousands of tourists has benefited the island's small local businesses, Yung said. National heritage recognition also made fundraising easier, he added. He said there were island natives who chose not to take part or come back to Cheung Chau for the festival, but there were others who are dedicated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The downside is that people now complain about the island being overcrowded with tourists," said Yung. "It's very difficult to find a balance."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the bun festival gets listed with </span><span class="s3">Unesco</span><span class="s1">, it would become part of the world's cultural heritage, said Chau Hing-wah, curator of the </span><span class="s3">Heritage Museum</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu, Chau and others insisted that safeguarding intangible cultural heritage was not about promoting tourism or creating other money-making opportunities. The truth is, Chau says, that many visitors are not aware of the real customs of the Cheung Chau festival besides the most eye-catching parades and lucky bun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is a dilemma. I certainly do not want to see the festival become too commercial. If [cultural heritage] serves tourists only, it is wrong," he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cultural critic and consultant Desmond Hui said: "Intangible cultural heritage carries intrinsic value that is important to a society's identity and knowledge."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Preserving such traditions helps to safeguard Hong Kong's identity amid a growing mainland influence, experts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yung said the Cheung Chau bun festival must go on - despite criticisms. The festival celebrates an identity that is unique in Hong Kong. He hoped more natives would return home. "It is our island's heritage that we are proud of," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The South China Morning Post will highlight some of the city's intangible cultural heritage in coming weeks</span></p>
