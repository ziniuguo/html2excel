<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has submitted a proposal to the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, calling for the establishment of a new board and a review of the Growth Enterprise Market, according to a local media report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board should have different categories of companies and each segment should be open only to the appropriate type of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, start-up companies will only be open to professional investors as they offer higher risks Start- ups will also have lower listing thresholds. But US-listed multinational companies with weighted voting right structures, such as dual-class share structures, will be open even to retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board aims to attract US-listed multinational firms, particularly China IT companies, and shift their listing to Hong Kong, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board might also lure start- ups from China, Hong Kong and member countries of the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the exchange has drafted a proposal for the setting up of a new board. He stressed the importance of ensuring relevant measures are in place to protect retail investors if weighted voting right structures are to be permitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last October, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder said that it was not impossible to allow a version of the voting right structures to operate in the local market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks inched up yesterday after opening lower and falling to their lowest point since February 14 in the morning session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the close, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was at 31,044.25, up 199.53 points or 0.65 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Afternoon trading once saw the index surge 236 points to 31,081 after dropping to as low as 30,453 in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike past years, the sharp correction in Hong Kong stocks has not drawn swarms of mainland bargain hunters, suggesting to some market watchers that a sharper slide may be coming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US policy tightening would reduce liquidity in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ANZ said factors shaping the Hong Kong dollar this year include the HIBOR-LIBOR spread, which widened after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> ended the zero rate regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is expected that the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will issue more and lower aggregate balance to influence the Hong Kong interbank offered rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, higher fluctuation of the yuan is expected this year and will depend heavily on the US dollar and the international market, said Raymond Yeung, ANZ's chief economist, Greater China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700), which was most actively traded with a turnover of HK$11.93 billion, surged in late trading 3.42 percent to HK$447.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> closed 0.86 percent higher to HK$8.22. </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (2318), which once saw its two-week low in the morning, was up 1.5 percent to HK$84.70.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The best-performed blue chip yesterday was </span><span class="s3">Sino Land</span><span class="s1"> (0083), jumping 4.05 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC Hong Kong Financial Investment (1520), which is related to CEFC, plunged nearly 30 percent after news that CEFC chairman Ye Jianming has been investigated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing yesterday said that investors should understand the risks of investing in companies under the proposed dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said "The weighted voting right under the proposed revisions will be only entitled to individuals but the SFC is communicating with the local bourse to the feasibility of allowing companies to have the weighted voting right."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of China Packaging Group (0572) plunged 39 percent yesterday after the company was informed that its major shareholder, Able Success Asia, would no longer be able to exercise its voting right.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Skyway Securities Investment, through its solicitor, informed CPG that Able Success Asia, which holds a 33 percent stake in the firm, will be shut and the hearing on the winding up will take place on August 13.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Able Success Asia is wholly owned by He Jianhong, the chairman and an executive director of CPG, who was suspended from his position on January 27 due to his continued absence since November 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He had used his stake in the packaging material maker as collateral to secure a loan from Skyway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company also warned yesterday that it expected to record a net loss for the first six months this year, mainly due to the increase in legal and other related expenses as a result of recent proceedings against the company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Establishment-linked Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen became president after the pro-democracy camp boycotted the vote at the end of more than four hours of chaos and clashes. That included members against Leung "occupying" the president's chair.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung, who belongs to the Business and Professionals Alliance and represents the industrial sector, finally defeated James To Kun-sun of the Democratic Party in a 38-0 vote. There were also three blank votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The election should have taken place after the oath-taking ceremony at about 1pm, but Eddie Chu Hoi-dick of the Land Justice League, Nathan Law Kwun- chung of Demosisto and "Long Hair'' Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats stood on the stage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The three claimed Andrew Leung had not provided enough evidence to prove he had renounced his British citizenship. That was despite him providing copies of two letters from the </span><span class="s3">British Home Office</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chu said he should provide his declaration of renunciation bearing a stamp of registration. Leung refused.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung Kwok-hung and Helena Wong Pik-wan also said a renunciation of citizenship did not mean he had abandoned right of abode in Britain, which would go against the Basic Law.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung Yiu-chung, the second most experienced legislator, started presiding over the meeting at 2.15pm when the opposition moved into occupation mode, starting a debate on Leung's citizenship.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Leung finally provided the original declaration of renunciation at 4pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung Yiu-chung then relinquished his place and the third most experienced legislator, Abraham Shek Lai-him, stepped up. He decided to relocate to a meeting room at 5pm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guards then stopped opposition legislators from occupying the chair there and Shek decided to start the voting right away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration and Edward Yiu Chung- yim of the Professionals Guild were then blocked from entering the room.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Civic Party's Claudia Mo Man- ching tried to usher Yau inside but ended up complaining of being hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pro-democracy legislators then left the meeting to protest at Shek's decision, with many tearing ballot papers on the way out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By 5.30pm Andrew Leung was the winner. "The election was carried out in accordance with the rules, but it was not done very well,'' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starry Lee Wai-king of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong is House Committee chairwoman and Dennis Kwok Wing-hang of the Civic Party deputy chairman.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is host to the world's busiest venue for initial public offerings this year, but has suffered the worst losses in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A boom in technology listings has propelled local deal value to US$35.7 billion (HK$279.32 billion), ahead of the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Yet companies that raised at least US$100 million dropped 6.2 percent in their first month of trading on average, the worst return since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A sharp pickup in IPOs may signal a sector's down cycle ahead," said Liang Jinxin, a strategist at Tianfeng Securities. "Technology companies fear an industry downturn will get worse if they don't go public now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New-economy firms accounted for more than 40 percent of Hong Kong's proceeds this year, up from about 20 percent in 2017. But they have also been some of those that suffered the most, with giant Tencent (0700) heading for its worst year on record.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing reform to attract technology companies helped boost IPO supply, but the demand remained slack amid macro weakness, said Philippe Espinasse, former head of Asia's equity capital markets group at Nomura.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both firms listed with weighted voting right, smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810) and food-delivery giant </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> (3690) fell yesterday, with the latter losing 4.38 percent and extending a record low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For firms that raised more than US$100 million in Hong Kong this year, individual investors placed orders for a median 1.6 times the stock available to them, down from 2.4 times in 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Despite sluggish demand, Chinese companies decided to go ahead with their listings to bolster their war chests as the United States increased interest rates and fought with China on trade, Espinasse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, mainland telecom software firm </span><span class="s3">AsiaInfo Technologies</span><span class="s1"> (1675) closed at HK$10.02 on its market debut yesterday, 4.57 percent lower than its IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, </span><span class="s3">Pacific Millennium Packaging</span><span class="s1">, the mainland corrugated packaging supplier, has raised HK$299.13 million after setting its IPO price at HK$3.98, the bottom of its indicative range.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other news, Chinese power supplier Sichuan Energy Investment Development has raised HK$476 million from its float after pricing in the bottom half of the range of HK$1.76 to HK$2.34, according to Reuters IFR.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun- wah says he will consider running for chief executive as "a professional civil servant.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he sidestepped the question of whether he would continue as financial secretary if Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying wins a second five-year term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said in July that he "would not mind" running for the top post if he can be of service to Hong Kong, but described it as a "tough job'' as whoever is the chief is subjected to criticisms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This job is definitely not easy. It's a very challenging one,'' Tsang said yesterday in an </span><span class="s3">RTHK</span><span class="s1"> interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But it's an important mission and it requires thorough consideration.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there is more than enough time to consider whether to join the chief executive election set for March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Between now and next year is still a long time and I will have a lot of opportunities to thoroughly consider it, from a personal perspective and a professional point of view, I think,'' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked what he meant by professional, he merely said: "Myself as a professional civil servant.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is widely tipped to seek a second five-year term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked if he would serve another five years as financial secretary if Leung wins, Tsang said the question is hypothetical, and that he will think about this when the time is right.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang called on all Hongkongers to use their voting right in Sunday's Legislative Council general election.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he will miss the elections because he is attending the G20 summit in the mainland. Tsang leaves for Hangzhou this morning to attend the Business 20 summit tomorrow and the G20 summit on Sunday and Monday as part of the mainland delegation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said he intends to meet with senior finance officials of different countries to strengthen Hong Kong's economic and financial ties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is not an official summit member but the SAR's financial secretary is a member of China's delegation, an arrangement that has been in place since 2008.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui said the commission will adopt an open-minded attitude on new product or weighted voting rights development, and the market development would be one of their considerations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui also said he will travel to Beijing to meet with the China Securities Regulatory Commission chairman Liu Shiyu, and hopes the Exchange Traded Fund connect cross-listing can be launched in the next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the most difficult part in opening the ETF connect is that the structure of ETF products between Hong Kong and China are very different. No timeline has been set on the launch, but he pointed out the SFC has already made some comments on the consultation paper on the corporate weight voting right scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui disclosed that the SFC received more than 80 reports of fraud and misconduct by the public through an online forum in the last two to three months, and some cases are being followed up.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record 220 companies are expected to list in Hong Kong this year, raising about HK$300 billion, twice as much as last year, according to Deloitte International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm also revealed that HK$243.4 billion was raised from IPOs in the first three quarters of the year, adding that the city will regain its crown as the world's top IPO destination in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-leaders of National Public Offering Group of Deloitte China, said new-economy firms have dominated the IPO market, with three out of top five IPOs this year being new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dick Kay, co-leaders of National Public Offering Group of Deloitte China, said the weighted-voting right structure implemented this year by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has been very successful, as the new rule was only implemented early this year but two companies have already listed on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, another accountancy firm EY said Hong Kong's IPO market experienced sharp spikes in the third quarter this year by both deal number and proceeds, with 18 percent of IPOs and 49 percent of global proceeds during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We saw the positive impact of new listing regulations on the Hong Kong IPO market," Ringo Choi, EY Asia-Pacific IPO leader said. "However, IPO activity was also negatively impacted by interest rate hikes and investors looking for interest rate-driven investments, a trend which could continue in 2019."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will work closely with mainland regulators and strive to include new-economy companies to stock connects, hoping to confirm the timetable as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse operator made the announcement after mainland stock exchanges said they would not expand their stock connect scheme with Hong Kong to foreign firms, companies with different voting right structures and so-called stapled securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stapled securities are formed when two or more securities are contractually bound together to form a single unit that cannot be bought or sold separately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Exchanges on both sides have agreed that foreign company shares and stapled securities will not be included in the list of eligible securities under stock connect's southbound trading for the time being," the HKEX said, implying its counterparts have not reached an agreement in accordance to dual-class listed firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai stock exchange said it reached the decision after consulting with domestic brokerages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Most of the investors expressed a lack of understanding of these new types of securities," the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Domestic investors do not fully understand the concept of stapled securities and had not completely grasped the operations and financial systems of foreign companies, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These types of securities need to wait until they have reached a certain quantity and a market operation basis before they can be considered for the participation of mainland investors," the exchange added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Responding to that, the HKEX believed companies listed in the city with weighted voting rights are eligible to be included in connects due to strict listing requirements it has set for such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse said investors are thus well protected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only companies with a market capitalization of HK$40 billion can get listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China exchanges' decision not to include the three types of firms means that mainland investors will not be able to invest in </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">, which made its debut in Hong Kong last week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The High Court has rejected an application by activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung for a judicial review to lower from 21 to 18 the age for candidates standing in the Legislative Council elections.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong, secretary general of the newly formed Demosisto party, disagreed with the court that the age limit is a political issue and said he will consider whether to appeal against the ruling.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong, 19, who filed the application on October 12, 2015, one day before his 19th birthday, argued that the difference in the minimum age requirements - 18 for voters and 21 for candidates - is unconstitutional. High Court Judge Thomas Au Hing- cheung said Wong's grounds for challenge were not reasonably arguable with a realistic prospect of success.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the right to vote and the right to stand for election were different.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Au said the imposition of the minimum candidate age requirement was obviously aimed at ensuring a degree of maturity for the person to carry out the functions and duties of a legislator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Au agreed with government counsel Benjamin Yu Yuk-hoi that voters do not occupy any public office that comes with its responsibilities that need to be discharged in the public interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Given the higher responsibility associated with the right to stand for election, it is reasonable for an electoral regime to impose a minimum age of candidature which is higher than that of voting," Au said, adding the notion is supported by the </span><span class="s3">European Court of Human Rights</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Au also said political issues should be handled by the legislature rather than in court.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The choice of the minimum candidate age is a discretionary political judgment for the elected members of the Legco to make, Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Au said the court should not make decisions for which it is not equipped, such as issues that should be deliberated by the legislature. Wong said the court decision would not affect Demosisto's preparation for the upcoming Legco election, and called on people to support the party's Oscar Lai Man-lok and Nathan Law Kwun-chung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said he respected the court ruling and the rule of law in Hong Kong, but disagreed with the court that the age limit is a political matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fighting for the right of people above 18 to stand for election is the same as getting the voting right for prisoners, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the court has refused leave for a judicial review, I still hope legislators will push forward to reduce the age limit from 21 to 18 to give Hong Kong people their equal rights to vote and stand for election," Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added ''having young politicians is a trend'' and the candidate age requirement will be an inevitable issue for the legislature.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange described a dispute with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges over plans to bar investors' access to dual-class shares as temporary, while analysts believe the ban is to stay for the time being.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland exchanges caught investors and Hong Kong stock exchange officials off guard on Saturday when they said they would not allow mainland investors to buy shares in Hong Kong-listed foreign firms, companies with different voting right structures or so-called "stapled" securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, pictured, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said he will fly to Beijing today and discuss the move with Chinese regulators and bourse officials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When you look at the two announcements, it is not about whether to include, it's about when to include - it's about temporarily giving people a chance to look at it, to study how it will work, but the direction of the inclusion is not changing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said any small difference between the exchanges is not going to change Hong Kong's role as a connector between international markets and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts found Li's move pointless and are convinced that the ban is due to Beijing's determination to develop Chinese depository receipts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That's only Li's own wishful thinking," said Shum Chun-ying, chief of Sincere Securities. "The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> will meet with him, but will not change its decision."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He argued that the commission aims to protect mainland investors, given that Xiaomi, the first company to list in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights, failed to answer a long list of questions required by the regulator and withdrew its Chinese depository receipts application last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Thus it still holds a lot of doubts on Xiaomi, and if the company makes it into stock connects, that would still hurt benefits of investors in the country."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides, if Xiaomi does trade in the mainland via Chinese depository receipts, it is not fair on investors who buy Xiaomi now when it is highly overvalued, said director of Phillip Securities Louis Wong Wai-kit. The prohibition has nothing to do with capital outflow, Wong added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Medical Council reform proposal should please most people in that one aim is for a reconstituted 32-member body to speed up the handling of complaints against doctors, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She is also optimistic her administration's plan going before the legislature will not be filibustered aside like her predecessor's effort because of its intention to increase the representation of the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine on the council rather than beefing up the number of appointed members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking ahead of an Executive Council meeting yesterday, Lam said there is a preliminary consensus among involved parties that the number of Department of Health and Hospital Authority representatives to be appointed will be one each rather than two each while the number of representatives of the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, which confers specialist accreditation, will go from two to four.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the four, two would be appointed and two elected by the academy, which represents about half of the SAR's 14,000 doctors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides speeding up the handling of complaints against doctors, Lam believes it will be easier for the Hospital Authority to engage overseas doctors to solve a chronic shortage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said: "We hope the increased number of academy representatives can enhance the professional competence in the Medical Council. I believe the academy will elect its representatives fairly and openly.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Civic Party legislator and urologist Kwok Ka-ki said the two elected doctors should be voted upon by all registered doctors in Hong Kong rather than by the academy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And he disagreed with Lam that a consensus has been reached as officials did not consult widely on the new plan. "It is very difficult for practising doctors to become academy fellows since the threshold is very high," he said. "It would be a bit weird to let the academy elect the two seats."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The academy said in a statement that it would consult its fellows and collect opinions on the election method for the two additional seats under the latest proposal. The Hong Kong Medical Association said the new proposal is "imperfect" but acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its president, Gabriel Choi Kin, said many doctors were against the proposal in a meeting last week as half of registered doctors would be deprived of a voting right under the amendment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But we decided to reluctantly accept the plan because we don't want to drag things on and further divide society," Choi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Patients' Rights Association of the Society for Community Organisation welcomed the new proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Spokesman Tim Pang Hung-cheong said the two additional members from the academy could enhance the medical standard and level of professionalism in the council. But "if doctors continue to stall and oppose the revised plan public trust in doctors will further deteriorate," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is Hong Kong not ready for democracy? This is a rhetorical question frequently asked by democrats. We all know the answer, so let's not get struck on it. A more realistic question is, "Is Beijing ready for Hong Kong to become a democracy?" I know the typical unthinking answer from our usual hate-China suspects would be a resounding, "NO!"</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But let's pause for a moment. The answer to Beijing's readiness or not is actually far from clear. I am not sure our top leaders have a clear answer at this moment. Basic Law Committee head Li Fei has only presented a framework, not a fixed position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has been Beijing's strategy to slow, but not to halt, democratic development in Hong Kong. It has insisted, until now, on controlling the composition and numbers of the election committee which alone has the voting right to choose the chief executive. Beijing is now ready to transfer that voting right to every eligible voter in Hong Kong. Think about what that means for an authoritarian dictatorship to do that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is universal suffrage by any definition. It is, however, not fair or "real" suffrage, in the rhetoric of many pan-democrats, because of the screening of candidates. That Beijing will still influence the background, numbers and composition - indeed the very existence of a nominating committee - means that such a full suffrage will fall short of international practices. It is, however, right out of the Basic Law. I don't deny the pan-democrats may win out yet. Bear in mind that sovereignty-obsessed Beijing was willing to grant considerable sovereignty-like powers to the two SARs, a subject I discussed previously. That could mean it could go all the way on democracy too. However, it is a no less valid position, held by many Hong Kong people but demonised by most pan-dems, that it is ok to accept a "broadly representative" nominating committee for 2017, with the proviso that it is not the endpoint, but a stepping stone, to full and FAIR democracy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would get the ball rolling on negotiations by focusing on the composition of the committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The all-or-nothing demand of many, but not all, pan-dems on public nomination is becoming a distraction; it may get us everything - or, more likely, nothing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ongoing legal tussle between Television Broadcasts (TVB) and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> looks set to continue with the regulator refusing to act on the broadcaster's latest disclosure, about its shareholder structure and appointment of directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts, however, welcomed the TVB move as they believe it will give the company more transparency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have no comment,” an SFC spokesman told the South China Morning Post, on the latest clarification from TVB that it would make any change to the regulator's decision over its share repurchase plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities watchdog first expressed concerns over the shareholder structure at TVB in May and said its major shareholder China Media Capital (CMC) may have too strong an influence appointing and removing directors of TVB.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC raised its concerns during the vetting process of a HK$4.21 billion (US$541 million) share repurchase planned by TVB. The regulator did not accept TVB major shareholder Young Lion's application for a whitewash waiver - a resolution that must be passed before a target company in a buyout situation can give financial assistance, forgive debts or provide other financial dealings to the buyer of the acquiring entity — to allow the company to be exempted from making a general offer to buy all the outstanding shares in TVB.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In late May, TVB brought judicial review proceedings against the SFC decision, but before</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">those could take effect, the company on Wednesday voluntarily released more information on its shareholder structure underlining how CMC did not have excessive influence in appointing directors to the TVB board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Athough the single largest shareholder in TVB through Young Lion, CMC can only nominate two directors to the broadcaster's 12 member-board of directors, TVB said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's despite Young Lion having the rights to nominate TVB four directors but CMC only has the right to nominate two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Chan Kwok-keung, the current TVB chairman has the right to nominate one director to TVB through his control of another holding company, Innovative View Holdings, which is also an investor in Young Lion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TVB now has 12 directors including Chan as the chairman and Li as vice-chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be good for TVB to disclose more information about its shareholder structure and how much influence its major shareholders have on the company. It will add transparency and boost confidence among investors,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director of VC Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TVB shares price closed at HK$28.95 at midday on Thursday, down 1.03 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TVB is majority-owned by Young Lion Holdings, which bought a 26 per cent stake in the broadcaster from the late Sir Run Run Shaw in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CMC, founded by chairman Li Ruigang, dubbed China's Rupert Murdoch, became an indirect investor in TVB when it bought an undisclosed stake in Young Lion in April 2015. Other shareholders in Young Lion include TVB chairman Charles Chan Kwok-keung and HTC Corp chairwoman Wang Hsiueh-hong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some 89.39 per cent of Young Lion's shares carry no voting rights, only 10.61 per cent have, the TVB announcement on Wednesday said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's Innovative View controls a majority of the voting shares in Young Lion while CMC indirectly controls a majority of all shares but most are non-voting right shares, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Chan Kwok Keung, chairman of TVB via Innovative View Holdings controls 56.51 per cent of all voting shares of Young Lion shares and 6 per cent of the total share in the company, the TVB announcement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CMC indirectly controls 32 per cent of the voting shares of Young Lion shares and 79 per cent in total, while Profit Global Investment controls while controls 11.49 per cent voting right shares and 14.99 per cent of Young Lion shares in total.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The board of directors of Yong Lion comprises five directors, Innovative View and CMC each nominated two directors while Profit Global Investment nominated the fifth director, TVB statement said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CMC also has the right to require Innovative Viewto sell all of its voting shares in Young Lion to a third party ordinarily resident in Hong Kong and nominated by CMC, TVB said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future, the California-based electric car start-up founded by Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting, said on Monday that its largest shareholder </span><span class="s3">Evergrande Health Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> had deliberately withheld promised payments and prevented it from seeking alternative financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The development comes after Evergrande accused FF of trying to scrap the original stake sale deal after spending the initial investment of US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande Health, a unit of the Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group, announced in June that it would buy a 45 per cent stake in FF for a total investment of US$2 billion, as part of the group's diversification plan into the hi-tech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the deal, Evergrande fully acquired Season Smart, which owns 45 per cent of the joint venture that controls FF - Smart King. Through Season Smart, Evergrande has already made an initial investment of US$800 million in FF. It also agreed to pay another US$1.2 billion in two equal instalments in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Evergrande said the EV start-up had started assembling its first high-end car, FF91, at its US production base. FF also set up an operating headquarters in China for research and development and production in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, in an exchange filing on Sunday night, Evergrande said FF demanded another US$700 million in July after spending the initial investment of US$800 million, following which it signed another agreement with the start-up to pay this US$700 million under certain “payment conditions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While “the payment conditions had not been fulfilled”, Jia “manipulated” his majority board seat position to begin an arbitration against Evergrande at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre on October 3, 2018, the filing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jia was seeking to deprive Season Smart of its shareholder right to approve any future financing plan, while also trying to terminate all the other agreements with Evergrande, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said that it has already fulfilled its obligations under the relevant agreements and that the arbitration has “severely damaged” their rights and interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Season Smart has engaged a team of international lawyers and will take all necessary actions to protect Season Smart's continuing rights under the relevant agreements, and to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF responded on Monday afternoon denying the accusations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Contrary to what has been reported, Evergrande failed to make any of the promised additional payments beyond the original US$800 million, despite FF and its CEO complying with their obligations and meeting all required conditions for funding under the July 2018 agreement,” FF said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Instead, Evergrande held the payments back to try to gain control and ownership over FF China and all of FF's intellectual property. At the same time, Evergrande is preventing FF from accepting any immediate financing from other sources.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF denied either Jia or anyone else had “manipulated” the board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up said Evergrande had a full understanding of why and when FF needed the additional US$700 million, which is to achieve production and delivery of FF91 in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the only reason ‘FF is trying to get out of the deal with Evergrande' is because Evergrande has failed to live up to its end of the bargain and make the payments it agreed to make … Evergrande shouldn't be permitted to withhold the funding and simultaneously prevent FF from accepting alternative financing or investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF added it will continue to take actions, including pursuing other funding opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in Evergrande Health briefly skidded 37 per cent at Monday's open, before paring losses to 16.4 per cent, to close at HK$8.78. Evergrande Group also lost 6.3 per cent to end at HK$20.95.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Evergrande Health has gained 90 per cent from the level before the June announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future is considered key to Evergrande Group's electric car ambition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hui Kayan, chairman of Evergrande Group, said in April the group plans to invest 100 billion yuan (US$14.5 billion) in the next 10 years in a wide range of hi-tech sectors like life sciences, AI, robotics, and alternative energy. Electric cars are an important part of the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said in August that Faraday Future aims to reach an annual production capacity of 5 million vehicles by 2028. The Chinese unit of Faraday Future has already been set up in Guangzhou city, with a registered capital of US$2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, Evergrande Group invested 14.5 billion yuan for a 41 per cent stake in Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment Group, one of China's largest car dealers. The investment has been regarded as an effort by Evergrande to pave the way for Faraday Future's car sales network in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Evergrande Health became the largest shareholder of the joint venture, it has less voting right than Jia because of the dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on the June agreement, each share Evergrande Health owns equals one vote compared to 10 votes for each share held by Jia. Consequently, Evergrande Health only has 12 per cent of the voting right. Jia, who owns 33 per cent of the company, controls the rest of the voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the agreement has a special clause, which stipulates that if the management is unable to perform its duties, Jia's voting rights will be reversed to Season Smart. It would result in a full control of Faraday Future by Evergrande Health.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future was founded in 2014 by Jia, chairman and CEO of the debt-saddled technology conglomerate LeEco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Jia defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to China and said he needed to stay in the US to focus on Faraday Future. He said his brother and wife had been empowered to handle matters relevant to the company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first salvoes in a corporate legal battle royal between the two largest shareholders of Hong Kong's biggest independent financial advisory firm were fired on Monday, as the second largest shareholder in </span><span class="s3">Convoy Global Holdings</span><span class="s1"> Kwok Hui-kwan launched his bid to overrule the company chairman's decision last December to revoke his voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kwok and his father, Kwok Ying-shing - the chairman of mainland developer Kaisa Group - both appeared in a packed High Court in Admiralty to attend the first day of what is expected to be a complex but intriguing five-day hearing before Mr Justice Jonathan Harris, dealing with several lawsuits brought by different shareholders of the company, including the one filed by the younger Kwok.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Explainer: Who's who in the tangled web of the Convoy enigma[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2126172/explainer-whos-who-tangled-web-convoy-enigma]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the first time he had ever appeared in public, but he still chose to wear a green medical face mask when he left court. Neither he nor his father responded to reporters' questions as they swiftly exited.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Monday's hearing listed the various lawsuits filed between December and February by the company's two largest shareholders: the Tsai family from Taiwan, who own Taiwan's </span><span class="s3">Fubon Financial Holding</span><span class="s1"> and have a 29.98 per cent stake in Convoy, and Kwok, who has a 29.91 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Convoy has around 100,000 customers, including the Hong Kong pension scheme, the Mandatory Provident Fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Convoy Collateral, the moneylending unit of </span><span class="s3">Convoy Global Holdings</span><span class="s1">, is also currently being investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> for corruption and market misconduct, after the two bodies raided its offices in early December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four senior Convoy officials were arrested, including former chairman Quincy Wong Lee-man.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dramatic turn of events prompted a management reshuffle which saw Johnny Chen Chi-wang installed as chairman, and a team backed by the Tsai family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A complicated series of subsequent lawsuits were then filed by Chen and the new management team against Wong, missing former Convoy director Roy Cho Kwai-chee, and over 20 others defendants, seeking some HK$715 million (US$91.41 million) regarding a number of share placements by Convoy in 2015 and other fund raisings, the proceeds of which are alleged to have gone into a network of companies related to Cho.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cho himself has not been seen since November, and earlier this week he was removed as a director after being out of contact for six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Convoy's lawyer Wong Ming-fung claimed on Monday the new management considered Kwok's accumulation of 29.91 per cent of Convoy involving various transactions during August 2017 matched the selling pattern of sales of stakes by Cho-related parties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said it was due to Kwok's share-trading connections to Cho that had led chairman Chen to attempt to block Kwok's shareholding rights the voting rights at a shareholder meeting in December.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The meeting itself was called by Kwok with the intention of removing any directors supported by the Tsai family and replace them with his supporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen's action meant Kwok was unable to vote to remove Tsai's supporters from the board. Kwok filed lawsuits the following month to oppose Chen's decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Sussex, representing Kwok junior, described Chen's decision to abandon Kwok's voting right as a “DIY (do-it-yourself) injunction” at Monday's initial hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sussex said the chairman should have applied for a court injunction to let a judge decide if Kwok's shareholder voting rights should be invalidated and not made the decision himself.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fascinating day two awaits on Tuesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So Rapper Dragon is the Horse of the Year already, right? Well, not quite, and the upcoming spring features, although diminished with a lack of overseas runners, will play a pivotal role in who gets top spot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This season's HOTY contest could also expose a flaw in the voting system, and there are still as many as four possible winners of the top gong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, Rapper Dragon could make it a very simple decision for the voting committee, winning the Group One Champions Mile would wrap it up after sweeping the four-year-old series and then beating the older milers in the Chairman's Trophy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even with the type of banner season John Moore's newest superstar has had, Rapper Dragon might not even be clubhouse leader for the award at this point.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Let's look at the other horse of the year and what has to happen for them to clinch it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If we stopped voting right now, rationally speaking, Helene Paragon has to be Horse of the Year. Two Group One wins, the Stewards' Cup and Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup, trump Rapper Dragon's season.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hey Rapper Dragon has won three Group Ones and a Group Two" wail his fans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Incorrect, not now that the club have been forced to strip the four-year-old series, including the BMW Hong Kong Derby, of black type status. With the four-year-old series not open to outsiders, they don't carry the cache of Group Ones... or do they? That will be up to voters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Helene Paragon upstages Able Friend as John Moore takes a Group One trio[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2074210/helene-paragon-upstages-able-friend-john-moore-takes-group-one-trio]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, if Helene Paragon wins the Champions Mile then he is even further in front. Neither horse wins, and then it is a tough choice - but there are other scenarios that could play out over the next two weekends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Winner of the Group Two Jockey Club Mile and Group One Hong Kong Mile, Beauty Only could easily be the forgotten horse in these discussions - unless he wins the Champions Mile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While that on its own might not beat Rapper Dragon's resume, or even Helene Paragon's, here's what it would do; make Beauty Only Miler of the Year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why does that matter? Under the current rules, Horse of the Year is chosen from the four champion categories: champion sprinter, miler, middle-distance and stayer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It seems a little unfair, at least historically, that Rapper Dragon could be made ineligible to win the main award. Especially given that whatever happens in the next few weeks, it's almost certain that 10 years from now we will look back and remember Rapper Dragon's rise to prominence and flawless efforts in the four-year-old races.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Horse of the Year has to be chosen from a champion category is a glitch in the system we've written about before and should be fixed. What if a horse comes along that wins at Group One level at 1,200m, 1,600m, 2,000m and even 2,400m? OK, crazy, but not inconceivable, and a horse like Ambitious Dragon may have been even capable of the feat. One win in each category might not be enough to win an individual champion award but it clearly that type of record should be rewarded with horse of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Beauty Only takes Champion Miler, it leaves Rapper Dragon needing his Classic Cup and Derby victories to clinch the middle-distance award. That's not a given, especially if Werther repeats in the </span><span class="s3">Audemars Piguet</span><span class="s1"> QEII Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japan beckons for Beauty Only after showing class in Hong Kong Mile[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2053729/japan-beckons-beauty-only-after-showing-class-hong-kong-mile]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other way Beauty Only could leave officials without any doubt is if Tony Cruz finally follows through on a promise to head to Tokyo for the Yasuda Kinen with his six-year-old.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frankly speaking, Beauty Only might not be good enough for what has become an increasingly difficult overseas target for Hong Kong horses, but the Yasuda Kinen does tick a lot of boxes for the horse. A typically fast-run mile that plays more like 1,800m on a rock hard surface would be perfect for Cruz's horse, but for one factor, the really, really good Japanese milers you have to race on home turf.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See above. A second consecutive QE II Cup and a win in one of the weakest Hong Kong Gold Cups of recent times might not be enough on its own, but it's likely that Werther will then press on to the Group One </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> Champions &amp; Chater ­- a win there as well would do the trick.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Class prevails as resilient Werther collects Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup[https://www.scmp.com/sport/racing/article/2074211/class-prevails-acrobatic-werther-takes-citi-hong-kong-gold-cup]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If everything stays the same, lets say internationals win both the Champions Mile and QE II - it looms as a test to see how highly the six-man voting committee, made up of members of the Association of Hong Kong Racing Journalists and racing executives, rate the four-year-old series and Derby.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The simplest scenario is of course that Rapper Dragon just wins that Champions Mile, and proves without doubt that he is Horse of the Year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Convicted former soccer boss Carson Yeung Ka-sing lost in his attempt to remove court-appointed receivers of </span><span class="s3">Birmingham City</span><span class="s1"> Football Club's parent company, as a High Court judge found he had used the company as his personal "cash dispenser".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yeung's son Ryan was on the payroll of </span><span class="s3">Birmingham International Holdings</span><span class="s1">, getting HK$80,000 a month, while Yeung was in charge as a significant shareholder, according to the receivers' reports, Mr Justice Anthony Chan Kin-keung noted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ryan, a full-time student, was also provided with an expensive vehicle and a flat for his use in Britain. His bodyguard received HK$40,000 a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither Ryan nor his bodyguard provided any service to the company or its subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It must be pointed out that the investigations conducted by the receivers have revealed a very disturbing picture which suggests that Yeung was treating the company as his cash dispenser," Chan wrote in his judgment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yeung asked the board of directors in December to remove the company's chairman and executive director, and to appoint as directors his wife, his son's bodyguard and a man who worked for him, the judge said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is perfectly plain that Yeung is unhappy that the company has been taken out of his control, and he would like to restore it by exercising his voting right and electing new directors to run the board," he wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yeung was jailed for six years in March last year on five charges of laundering HK$721 million. He was granted bail only two weeks ago, pending his appeal at the Court of Final Appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After he requested a shake-up of the board of directors, the board applied to the courts for receivers to be appointed. The receivership order was granted in February, after which Yeung filed a discharge application to the courts to remove those receivers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan noted the receivers had uncovered suspected misappropriation of funds by the previous management and prepared three reports about the accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They were also negotiating with Trillion Trophy Asia, which was interested in the shares of Birmingham International and had agreed to provide cash of HK$9.8 million and a HK$153 million loan to the football firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It appears that the receivers are doing a good job in keeping the company afloat, and taking actions to recover its losses from the wrongdoers," Chan wrote.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week leaders from five emerging economies celebrated the birth of a new bank on the block.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Development Bank is intended to rival Western-led financial institutions and become a more sympathetic alternative for developing countries and a platform for China to exert greater global prowess.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it faces an uphill battle, analysts say. Potential competing interests among the five so-called BRICS nations, and the bank's relatively small initial capitalisation, present obstacles, they say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the bank will start lending by 2016 with an initial capitalisation of US$50 billion and a US$100 billion emergency reserve fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite disagreement about the location of the bank's headquarters, Shanghai was chosen in the end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank's declaration says all member states will play equal roles. India will provide the first president, while the first chairman of the board of governors will be from Russia, and the first chairman of the board of directors chosen by Brazil. It takes a long time and intense negotiation for such issues to be settled Oliver Rui, finance professor</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> spokesman, all members would have equal share of voting rights in the new bank. But for the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, a US$100 billion pool to help countries facing short-term liquidity pressures, China would have the largest voting right - 39.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any such friction could undermine the lender's growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oliver Rui, a professor of finance and accounting at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said nations seeking to cast a more influential role and leverage could present a hurdle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It takes a long time and intense negotiation for such issues to be settled," Rui said. "It's not easy at all."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said such questions would not prevent the bank from providing financing to developing nations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No consensus has emerged on which nations will be the initial recipients of the loans. The founders have said any nation can apply for assistance, but some scholars say the bank is unlikely to lend outside the BRICS grouping, at least initially.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In either case, the bank's capitalisation will limit the reach of the institution. Zhu Jiejin, a researcher with the Centre for BRICS Studies at </span><span class="s3">Fudan University</span><span class="s1"> in Shanghai, said the bank's financial size would not be enough to make a big impact on the five emerging economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It might take 20 years before the real impact of the New Development Bank can be felt around the world," Zhu said. "But the establishment of the bank is certainly in line with China's strategy to play a bigger role in the world."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cao Heping, a professor of economics at </span><span class="s3">Peking University</span><span class="s1">, said the small initial capitalisation would mean the bank could only prioritise projects within its founding members. "The US$50 billion could only fund five to six projects in China," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The existing international development financing system is centred on the </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">, set up 70 years ago. But many also see the new bank as an attempt by China to challenge what it views as a US-led system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Professor Stephany Griffith-Jones, an economist at the Initiative for Policy Dialogue at </span><span class="s3">Columbia University</span><span class="s1">, said huge infrastructure needs in the developing world provided room for more institutions like the BRICS bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We talk about competition in the private sector, we encourage that, and we should have competition in the public sector too."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said that while the </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> had in the past enforced conditions that were not always in the developing countries' best interests, the new bank might offer an alternative that is more sympathetic to such clients.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They [BRICS countries] may have more sympathy to developing countries because they have undergone, or are undergoing, development themselves," Griffith-Jones said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong must reform its listing rules to attract New Economy businesses and remain relevant as Asia's financial hub, said </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">' founder Jack Ma. The city as a destination for the initial public offer of Alibaba's online payments unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is “not a foregone conclusion,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, also called AliPay, is poised for an IPO to fund its expansion. At issue is whether Hong Kong's regulatory framework is suitable for companies engaged in financial technology, or fintech, said Ma.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There's been a lot of media reports and speculation as to whether AliPay will list in Hong Kong,” Ma said in a telephone interview with the South China Morning Post. “We will list in Hong Kong only if we think the city is ready.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“All the existing listing regulations were designed decades ago before the Internet Age for property developers, banks, financiers and traditional retailers, and not relevant to startups and new businesses,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 343 companies that raised capital in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013, only 22, or 6 per cent of the total, were technology related, according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chose to list its shares in New York in 2014, in a US$25 billion IPO that was the world's largest that year. The Hangzhou-based company operates the world's largest online shopping and e-commerce platform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A factor that swayed Alibaba's choice was the Hong Kong regulator's refusal to allow for a dual-share structure, on the grounds that it violates the long-held principle of “one share, one vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such structures are prevalent among many technology startups including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba, where many company founders hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 US-listed Chinese companies such as Baidu and Weibo, 29 of them have dual-class structures. Baidu's founder Robin Li owns only 15.9 per cent of the company but has a voting right of 53.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The global economic structure has changed, and our existing listing regime must change with it,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a broker and the Hong Kong lawmaker representing the city's financial services. “If nothing is changed, all these technology and New Economy companies will list in the US or other overseas markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The competition has taken on added urgency. The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) won approval from its listing advisory committee in September to allow companies to list dual-share structures. It may be a necessary measure for Singapore's bourse, which has attracted few IPOs in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US market has shown that such structures can attract big technology startups to list. The top 25 dual-share structure companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">LinkedIn</span><span class="s1"> in the US have a combined market capitalisation of US$927.42 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, an AliPay IPO in Hong Kong doesn't need a waiver to the regulator's principle, since the company isn't incorporated under a dual-share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, an intensive debate and several rounds of public consultation have been underway in Hong Kong since the city missed out on the IPO of Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock sale would have added much-needed market turnover, giving brokers higher commission income from transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, US$1.61 billion of Alibaba's shares changed hands in New York, equivalent to a fifth of the market turnover on Hong Kong's main board on the same day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, the commercial unit of the stock exchange, also missed out on an initial listing fee of HK$650,000 and an annual listing fee of HK$1.9 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AliPay, through which shoppers on Alibaba's Taobao and TMall platforms can make payments, is valued at US$60 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What is lacking in Hong Kong is the spirit of innovation, which regrettably stands in the way of the city realising its goal of becoming Asia's financial centre,” Ma said. “I'm confident Hong Kong can still claim its place as the financial centre of the region if it carries forward with its reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in 2014 began consulting the market about various measures to change its listing rules and mechanism, including the possibility of permitting dual-share structures in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation has gone in fits and starts, with the deadline of the latest round that began in June extended until November 18.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The introduction of dual-class technology stock listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely to</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">narrow the valuation gap between Chinese and US technology stocks listed in the United States, says the chief executive of exchange-traded fund manager Enhanced Investment Products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tobias Bland said that thanks to the impending launch of the weighted voting right governance structure by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, he expected several Chinese technology “marquee players” - smartphone giant Xiaomi as well as leading fintech players Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> - and Ping An Good Doctor to list with Hong Kong as their primary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights will also lead to dual listings in Hong Kong by technology companies that are already listed in the US as American depositary receipts, he said. Together, the growing number of technology stocks in Hong Kong will mean that the price-to-earnings multiples of Chinese technology American depositary receipts - and their respective share prices - would be due for an upgrade, said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weighted voting rights structure, which is still not allowed by Chinese regulators, will also incentivise more Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, industry players have long said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we look at Chinese American depositary receipts that make up our exchange-traded funds portfolio, last year they had a 70 per cent run on average in their share prices based purely on their revenue growth, which is about 40-50 per cent on average per year. Yet, they are trading at an average 28-29 times the 2018 expected earnings, which is a big gap compared with the 35 times average of US internet stocks,” said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American depositary receipts are the US dollar-denominated shares of a non-US company. Created by depositary banks, these represent one or several underlying shares from the company's local stock market, and are interchangeable with the underlying stocks.Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuationsJerry Peng, China equity strategist, Citi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors seeking to profit from price level differences between underlying stocks and their US-listed counterparts often create or cancel American depositary receipts through depositary banks. In such arbitrage trading strategies, investors target to profit by selling American depositary receipts trading at a premium to the underlying stock, and buying the underlying stock, or vice versa. Hence, arbitrageurs help to narrow out the price differentials that could exist across the two markets, enabling their prices to often track each other closely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Bland said, the good news for holders of American depositary receipts - such as those of </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, NetEase, Ctrip, Baidu, Alibaba - is that they can expect to see their price-to-earnings multiples getting re-rated by investors in the US market. Tencent, for example, is trading at forward multiples of more than 40 times, and that could be a level that the earnings multiples of other American depositary receipts could match as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the moment, their American depositary receipts performance is often hurt by a general scepticism among US investors about Chinese names,” he said. Contrarily, investors in China and Hong Kong have better understanding of their businesses as frequent users of their services, and such understanding will support Hong Kong-listed technology stocks' performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jerry Peng, China equity strategist at Citi, however, said that while he did not rule out that American depositary receipts might be boosted by strong investor sentiment around more Chinese technology stocks listing in Hong Kong, any such benefits are likely to be short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Offshore investors still look at fundamentals. Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuations,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peng said investors who trade American depositary receipts and Hong Kong stocks will still look at the American depositary receipt levels as reference for valuations, as many leading technology focused investors are still based in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of these American depositary receipt investors trade global technology stocks, including those listed in Korea, Taiwan and China … they already know a lot about these companies. Hence, in terms of knowledge of the issuers they are not significantly disadvantaged to Hong Kong investors,” said Peng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX is expected to launch a formal consultation on the proposed amendments to listing rules that will pave the way for the launch of weighted voting rights during the first quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street cheers Hong Kong's IPO rules revamp but sees New York's dominance unthreatened[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2133566/wall-street-cheers-hong-kongs-ipo-rules-revamp-sees-new-yorks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) busies itself consulting on detailed trading rule changes, to pave the likely way for companies seeking dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, it's time to outline exactly what their inclusion in the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index would mean.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a proposal by HKEX, a one-month consultation period ends on March 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its plan is to attract three categories of new-economy companies to list here: large biotech companies without revenue, giant dual-class shareholding structured new economies companies, and US-listed mainland new-economy companies looking for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting right over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are popular among many tech firms such as US tech firm </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, and pointedly mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns South China Morning Post. The fact Hong Kong could not then offer Alibaba a dual-class structure was seen as a strong reason why the tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With several “unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion) expected to seek public funding in the not-too-distant future, such as Xiaomi, WeLab, Lufax, and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">, officials in Hong Kong are anxious not to have a repeat of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX expects to start accepting dual-class applications, soon after the end of the consultation's conclusion in late April, with the first dual-class share companies floating in the city as early as June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we still don't know whether or when successful dual-listed companies will eventually be allowed to be included in the benchmark Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's important, as many passive fund managers track the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index. If such companies were be added to these indexes, they could be accessed by a much larger pool of institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there are the Stock Connect share trading links between the Hong Kong exchange and its peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen to consider, which only allow the trading of stocks listed on the major Hang Seng Indexes (again, the Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index) to qualify, and in which mainlanders and mainland mutual funds have readily invested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong exchange's turnover comes via southbound trading over the Stock Connect links.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So if these stocks are not allowed to be included in the major indexes, mainlanders would unable to buy them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Indexes Company, which compiles the benchmark indices, completed its own public consultation on the issue, ending On February 28 - but it's still yet to publish its conclusions nearly a fortnight on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants themselves, say they still have mixed views on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers, supports the inclusion of dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index, giving a green light to mainlanders to plough into them via Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many passive fund managers, however, oppose the suggestion, as once dual-class shares are included in the leading Hang Seng indexes, they fear they would have no choice but to focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other fund managers express reservations on the dual-class structure as it violate the city's “one-share, one vote” rule - an important principle for listed companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, New York's S&amp;P and London's FTSE indexed have not included these companies in some of their indexes, as in some cases they add restrictions on calculating their weighting on a gauge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSCI, another major index complier, is also consulting the market on their inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland exchanges consider allowing them, we are going to see more of these companies listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any blanket ban on them appearing in major indexes would be unlikely - but we are likely to see some restrictions coming with such issuances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many sector the adage that “uncertainty breeds opportunity” rings true, but not in this case. Markets hate it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so it's now doubly important the Hang Seng Indexes Company and other compilers announce their final decision on dual-class shares, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> governor Zhou Xiaochuan is personally backing efforts to develop a yuan trading centre in Australia, Treasurer Joe Hockey told the South China Morning Post on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Obviously if we can have a relationship on RMB trading like London or some other jurisdictions, that helps, but the trend is heading in the right direction. Governor Zhou has given me a personal assurance that if there is more that can be done to facilitate the growth, we'll work together to make it happen," he said, without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hockey made the comments after attending the signing ceremony for the newly established US$50 billion </span><span class="s3">Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</span><span class="s1"> (AIIB) in Beijing on Monday. Australia was the first foreign nation to sign up as a founding member of the China-led multilateral bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China has come a very long way in a very short period of time in deregulating its currency and the West has not given China enough credit for how quickly it moved for such a massive economy," Hockey said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sydney is among the major cities around the world looking to become a yuan trading hub. The city was granted a clearing bank facility in February and a 50 billion yuan (HK$63 billion) investment quota under the RQFII (Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) scheme through which offshore investors can directly purchase mainland stocks and bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia also renewed a currency swap agreement worth 200 billion yuan with China in April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cities like London, Singapore and Luxembourg are increasingly vying for a bigger slice of the offshore yuan business. Yuan trading volume in both London and Singapore more than doubled last year. Hong Kong, however, remains the largest offshore yuan centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Promoting the international use of the yuan as a trade settlement currency has been the core strategy of China's financial diplomacy since 2009, when it launched a pilot programme in Hong Kong to settle physical goods trade in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hockey highlighted the just-concluded free trade agreement between China and Australia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will be a free movement of people between the two countries. As a result of the free trade agreement, I see a substantial increase in person-to-person trade and in small-business-to-small-business trade. In this case, there will be great flow of money and the RMB/AUD trade will increase in volume," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, for the first time, China became the biggest foreign investor in Australia, with Chinese investment there totalling A$64.5 billion (HK$383.6 billion). Australia was the second-biggest destination for Chinese investments, after the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia's imports from China grew by 10.2 per cent to A$52.1 billion while its exports to China fell by 4.9 per cent to A$90.1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> will this year review the yuan's eligibility to join the Special Drawing Rights, its reserve currency basket. To make it to this elite currency list, the yuan will have to win at least 70 per cent of the votes of </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> member countries. Australia has a 1.31 per cent voting right at the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China is certainly doing everything it can to have the yuan qualified as part of the SDR currencies," Hockey said. "There is no shortage of willingness that I can detect from the Chinese leadership to move in the right direction in relation to the RMB."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The AIIB is expected to provide a massive boost to those ambitions as it underwrites infrastructure across the region that currently see a demand of about US$1 trillion a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China on Monday obtained a 30.34 per cent stake and the largest share of voting rights in the AIIB, giving it an effective veto in the institution.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is not uncommon in these international institutions for a large player involved in the set-up to have veto power. The US has one over the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">, for example," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors have mixed views on the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s consultation exercise for a change in listing rules to accommodate companies with dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> found a wide range of reactions when it conducted a survey of its members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some fund houses oppose changing the rule to allow companies with a dual-share structure to list here as that would allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. They fear this would affect investor protection," association chairman Bruno Lee Kam-wing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, there are others who believe we should consider a rule change to allow technology companies like Alibaba [Group Holding] to list. They believe the current regulations cost us the opportunity to have such a mega company list here and hurt the competitiveness of the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEx consultation, which runs until the end of this month, follows its refusal in October last year to exempt Alibaba from the ban on dual-share structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of its board members even though they only hold a minority stake. Alibaba listed in the United States in September in the world's largest flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has banned dual-share structures since 1989, with Swire Pacific the only exception because its two classes of shares were issued before the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">'s head of corporate governance David Smith said he would prefer HKEx to maintain the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is not lagging the world at all as most Asian and Western markets do not allow such structures," Smith said. "The US is the largest market that allows companies with a dual-share structure to list, but it also allows investors to use class actions to sue the companies or directors while Hong Kong does not allow class action."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that if Hong Kong changed its rules to allow dual-share structures, listing hopefuls and their bankers would think of different "creative shareholding" structures to protect the interests of major shareholders or management at the expense of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If many new listings and existing companies shift to a dual-share structure, it would limit the pool of single-share-structure companies for investors," he said. "Investors would prefer investing in a company with a single-class share structure to a company with a dual-class structure. One share, one vote is the best."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith said his fund invested in dual-share-class companies with good management, such as Swire, and there was a variety of models for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two classes of Swire shares carried the same voting rights but had different dividend payment levels, while some dual-share-structure companies had sunset provisions that turned shares with more voting rights into ordinary shares when they were transferred, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We invest in a company for the long term or forever if possible," he said. "As such, we want to make sure we have the voting right to remove poorly performing management or directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If a company lists in a way that ensures the management cannot be removed, we will have to question why it is doing that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shareholders will support any management if it can bring profit and benefit to shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While some believe dual-share structures should be allowed as long as the risks are disclosed, Smith said passive fund managers would have no choice but invest according to the weighting of the index. That would mean that if some dual-share firms were added to an index, they would be forced to invest in those companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sun Hung Kai Financial executive director Joseph Tong Tang said Hong Kong could consider changing the listing rules as long as additional measures were put in place to safeguard shareholder interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many technology firms have good prospects but their founding members only hold minority stakes," Tong said. "Hong Kong could be more flexible in our rules to attract these companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Securities Association chairman Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak said brokers had reservations about a rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The dual-share structure would create unequal treatment of shareholders," Chan said. "It would be good to have more new listings but we do not want this at the expense of having two classes of shareholders, with some having more say than others."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> reported on Wednesday a 44 per cent increase in interim earnings, boosted by a raft of initial public offerings that helped it regain the top spot in global fundraising rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX said on Wednesday its interim net profit stood at HK$5.04 billion (US$642.1 million) or HK$4.07 per share, up from HK$3.49 billion a year earlier. This is the highest half-year profit since the exchange was established and listed in 2000. It is also higher than the 37 per cent profit growth to HK$4.8 billion estimated by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's shares closed 1 per cent higher at HK$229 following the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After deducting first-quarter profit of HK$2.56 billion, net profit for the second quarter from April to June stood at HK$2.48 billion, up 40 per cent from a year earlier and beating Nomura's estimate of 22 per cent year-on-year profit growth to HK$2.16 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the first half of 2018, the world's financial markets experienced bouts of volatility following significant corrections across major stock markets. Investor sentiment was dominated by uncertainties over escalating US-China trade tensions, geopolitical risk in several parts of the world and policy divergence of major central banks. Lingering uncertainties are likely to cast a dark cloud over global markets for the remainder of this year,” said Laura Cha Shih May-lung, chairwoman of HKEX, in her first interim results statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the world enters a new era of fintech, there will be many opportunities as well as challenges. At HKEX, an innovation lab was established to explore the increased use of emerging technologies in various parts of our business, both operationally and strategically,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse's trading and clearing fee income was boosted by rising average daily turnover, which increased 67 per cent to HK$126.6 billion in the first half, compared with HK$76 billion in the first half of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee income rose as 108 companies launched IPOs in the first half, up 50 per cent from 72 last year, after the HKEX in April started accepting dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotech firms without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told reporters at a late afternoon press conference on Wednesday that Hong Kong had reclaimed the top spot in global fundraising rankings thanks to the trading debuts of China Tower and </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is back to No 1 worldwide in terms of IPO funds raised,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wednesday action catapulted Hong Kong ahead of the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in terms of global rankings, bringing its year-to-date fundraising to HK$187 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have received three weighted voting right companies and nine biotech firms applying to list in Hong Kong under the new listing regime. There are dozens of more companies making enquiries,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He cautioned of challenges ahead in the second half due to lower turnover as investors focused on rising trade tensions between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/08/fec6023e-9949-11e8-9a20-262028f49e8a_image_hires_201439.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's board said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$3.64 per share, up 43 per cent from HK$2.55 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect scheme linking Hong Kong with mainland China exchanges brought in revenue of HK$365 million in the first half, more than double the HK$162 million a year earlier. Funds from mainland Chinese investors into Hong Kong stocks now represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of market turnover.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a large pipeline of ‘new economy' listings which, in our view, could change the market dynamics and structurally lead to higher turnover,” said York Pun, an HSBC analyst, in a research note before the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Robert Lee Wai-wang, executive director of Hong Kong-based broker Grand Finance Group, said he was upbeat on the earnings prospects for HKEX in the second half in spite of global political and economic headwinds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market turnover of HKEX in the second half of this year may be affected by the poor market sentiment. The US and China trade war may continue to haunt markets. Interest rate rises would also have an negative impact. However, the listing reform could bring in more technology firms and biotech companies to list. The long-term outlook of HKEX remain positive,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will hold a press conference in the afternoon to discuss the results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is gaining traction as the primary choice for mainland technology firms seeking to float as they shun stock exchanges in New York, and mainland China, amid the two countries' simmering trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frank Lin, a partner at PwC in Shanghai, said an increasing number of Chinese companies are seeking to raise capital in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sectors on the city's stock market, as they assess the ongoing and potential future impact of the trade stand-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US-China trade war is expected to escalate in the foreseeable future, and it is going to affect decision-making by Chinese TMT firms looking to choose listing venues,” he said, adding that mainland companies are also closely analysing the spat's effect on their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle among regional and global stock exchanges to attract prospective Chinese technology firms escalated in the first half of this year when mainland regulators attempted to up their ante in easing IPOs by foreign-funded mainland companies through the Chinese depositary receipts (CDR) mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Announced in March and aimed especially at luring overseas-incorporated technology leaders, the CDR enables mainland investors that are barred from freely moving their money abroad, to directly trade-in the underlying securities issued overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pick up in IPO business in Hong Kong is significant, given the high stakes involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Shanghai eclipsed Hong Kong for the first time in both the number of IPOs and the amount of capital raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with mainland exchanges for global fundraising crown[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the recent lacklustre performance of the A-share market has deterred mainland regulators from launching any CDRs, with not a single Chinese technology firm jumping aboard so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online parenting firm Babytree Group and AsiaInfo, the leading provider of telecom software and information-technology services, are among the mainland technology firms to have already submitted applications to the Hong Kong exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the industry watchdog, also sets a higher listing threshold for start-ups, requiring any IPO applicant to have posted a profit before even filing papers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months of this year, only four Chinese TMT companies completed IPOs in Hong Kong, but that number is expected to soar in the second half buoyed by rising enthusiasm in raising funds on the market, says Lin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1810&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] netted HK$37.1 billion (US$4.7 billion) through an IPO before China Tower Corp[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=0788&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which operates the telecommunications towers for the world's biggest cellular phone networks, completed a HK$54.3 billion share sale the following month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin said Hong Kong's efforts to ease listing requirements for tech companies have paid off handsomely, with reforms on both the city's weighted voting right (WVR) structure and the allowing of pre-revenue biotech firms to list on the local stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The WVR structure, or multiple classes of shares, also allows company founders to exert stronger control on a listed business, even with a minority ownership.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has gained the upper hand in attracting hundreds of promising mainland tech firms hungry for capital,” said Ding Haifeng, a consultant with Integrity Financial Consulting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the next few months, it's certain that more companies will consider listing in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is democracy? It's a particularly relevant question for this city as it debates how it should elect its next chief executive in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And the Hong Kong Arts Festival contributes to this discussion by bringing Fight Night to town, an engaging and entertaining piece of interactive theatre that offers some insight into this political system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Directed by Alexander Devriendt, the show's premise is straightforward: five actors are put on stage as "candidates" and only one will be left standing by the end of the performance after the rest are voted out by the audience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fight Night first appeared to be about the actors, and how they would outwit one another in order to survive. But as the evening progressed, it became increasingly apparent the show was less about them but more about us, the voters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So who was "us" on this opening night? Under the guidance of facilitator Angelo Tijssens, we used a remote control device to "vote" on a series of questions that established the audience profile: statistically, it was predominantly female, single, aged between 25 and 44, and, apparently, earned more than HK$70,000 a month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Next entered the five candidates and the audience was asked to use the same device to vote for its favourite candidate based on their appearance, beliefs, inclinations and so on. Everyone had a vote. All fair and square, it seemed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But I soon found myself slipping into the minority; whichever candidate I chose, lost. The show reached its climax when part of the audience was persuaded to give up their voting right all together to "occupy" the stage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Credit should be given to Devriendt, who tweaked the Fight Night format for Hong Kong - it worked. He also showed us the power of the majority in a "democracy".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing reforms, due to kick-start later this month, are likely to attract more technology firms to list on its stock exchange - but only as long as the authorities can provide appropriate investor protection measures, the head of leading global fund manager Janus Henderson Investors has cautioned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, is now in a race with counterparts in mainland China, Singapore and the US to compete for new technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what's expected to be the largest listings shake-up in Hong Kong for three decades, dual-class shareholdings are likely to be included for tech and biotech companies without strict requirements on revenues and profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities commission backs introduction of dual-class shares on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124972/securities-commission-backs-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a structure will allow one class of shareholders to own more voting right than others, an arrangement favoured by many founders keen to maintain control while still holding minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move comes after more than two years of consultation, and remains controversial, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While HKEX and many tech firms want to change the rules to allow them to list here, many fund houses oppose the change as they would violate the city's long-held “one share, one vote” principle, and may hurt the interest of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major UK investor Aberdeen Standard Investments, for instance, does not favour these kinds of company listings, due to corporate governance concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1">, the fund industry's controlling body in the city, has also called on HKEX to require dual class shareholding companies to appoint more independent board directors, to safeguard the interests of fund companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Andrew Formica, Janus Henderson's co-chief executive, has now come out and said his company would invest in these companies, but only with the caveat they have good corporate governance standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will the introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong boost Chinese tech shares listed in US?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2131905/will-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong-kong-boost-chinese-tech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[Investing in] technology companies is a fast growing market in the US and Europe,” Formica said in an interview with South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What's important is that HKEX and the regulators introduce measures to protect the interests of [all] investors, who are [taking a share] in these tech companies.”What's important is that HKEX and the regulators introduce measures to protect the interests of [all] investors, who are [taking a share] in these tech companiesAndrew Formica, Janus Henderson Investors' co-chief executive</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said his fund house had invested in some US-based dual class shareholding companies now listed, and would again in future, only “if the managements can show they are adopting good corporate governance standards for small shareholders”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Janus Henderson was created by the merger of </span><span class="s3">Janus Capital Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Henderson Global Investors</span><span class="s1"> in May last year, which expanded its footprint with managers investing across stocks, bonds and other alternative assets classes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Headquartered in London and dual-listed itself in New York and Australia, Janus Henderson has US$344.9 billion worth of assets under management, more than 2,000 employees and offices in 27 cities worldwide.Its Asia-Pacific assets under management had risen to US$58 billion by the end of last year, and it has 200 staff in Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney and Melbourne.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Formica said after the merger, it has more resources to develop its new technology investment portfolio, and certainly aims to expand further in Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asia has a huge population and fast economic growth,” he said. “There are a lot of customers who have growing demand for investment services in the region.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new board is among the measures </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) will consider in its bid to lure more technology start-ups to list on the city's bourse, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 343 companies to list in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013, only 22, or 6 per cent of the total, were technology related, according to HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to introduce a dual-shares structure on the grounds that it would violate the long-held principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-share structures, which allow shares with unequal voting rights to be listed, are popular with technology firms, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate had raged for years on the issue, but the topic was thrust into the spotlight two years ago when Chinese e-commerce juggernaut </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, opted to list its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Losing out on a listing by Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has been costly for the Hong kong exchange, financially and in terms of market development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Thursday, turnover of Alibaba shares was US$2.75 billion (HK$21.43 billion) - equivalent to almost a third of total Hong Kong stock market turnover of HK$65 billion on the same day. HKEX's turnover would get a significant boost from the increased trading fees, while brokers would benefit from higher commission income from these trades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised a record-breaking US$25 billion from its IPO in the US in 2014. Its decision to choose New York meant Hong Kong lost out that year as the world's largest IPO market. HKEX also missed out on an initial listing fee of HK$650,000 and an annual listing fee of HK$1.19 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No doubt these are among the factors that have prompted HKEX to examine ways of lowering the entry barriers for new tech companies wishing to float their stock here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should have a new board, or we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets for the new start-ups and innovation companies to list here,” Li said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments came as regional competition among bourses looking to attract a new generation of technology start-ups intensified.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bourse to study measures to attract more tech start-ups to raise funds in the city[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2012287/hong-kong-bourse-study-measures-attract-more-tech-start-ups-raise]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) on Monday won approval from its listing advisory committee to allow companies to list dual-shares structures, favoured by many start-ups as many of their founders hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It may be a necessary measure for Singapore's bourse, which has attracted few IPOs in recent years, but some analysts point out that the move is risky as up to 90 per cent of start-ups fail.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the US market has shown such structures can attract big tech players to list. The top 25 dual-share structure companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and LikedIn in the US have a combined market cap of US$927.42 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies, such as Baidu and Weibo, listed in the US, 29 of them have dual-class structures. Baidu's founder, for example, has only a 15.9 per cent stake in the company but has a voting right of 53.5 per cent.We will study whether we should have a new board or adopt a new disclosure regime for the new start-ups to list hereCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had wanted to list in Hong Kong in 2013 with a structure that would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate half of the board, but the dual-share arrangement has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in 2014 began consulting the market about the possibility of permitting dual-share structures here, but the exercise ground to a halt when the SFC opposed the idea, fearing it would undermine investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city is not lacking start-ups. They just choose not to raise funds through HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 2015 survey by </span><span class="s3">InvestHK</span><span class="s1"> reported a 46 per cent increase in the total number of start-ups to 1,558 compared with 1,065 in 2014. Hong Kong is now home to more than 10 accelerator and incubation programmes, ranging in scope from financial technology to healthcare, run by large corporations including </span><span class="s3">Accenture</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board's requirement for HK$50 million in profit in the three years ahead of a listing is considered to be too high for start-ups, as is the Growth Enterprise Market's stipulation of a cash flow of HK$20 million in the previous two years of operation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jack Ma told University of Macau students in June that he “very much hopes” to list Ant Financial Services, the operator of Alipay, in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A lack of clear leadership among protesters means the situation is getting increasingly dangerous and out of control, an executive councillor has warned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Cheng Yiu-tong, also honorary president of the Beijing-friendly Federation of Trade Unions, believes that Beijing will not step in, as some people fear, because the police are capable of controlling events.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Nobody is calling the shots after the Occupy campaign started. You can have protesters with different views on whether to retreat or stay on certain protest sites," he said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are different kinds of people taking part in the occupation activities and it's easy for it to get out of control."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The veteran Beijing-loyalist branded the three Occupy co-founders as "shameless" for taking a back seat after kicking off the civil disobedience movement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benny Tai Yiu-ting, co-founder of Occupy Central, said protest organisers could not make the decision to retreat from protest sites lightly before concrete progress was made.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tai admitted earlier the campaign was out of control and the protests might stop only if Leung Chun-ying stepped down as chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Sunday, pledges to restore access to the Chief Executive's Office in Admiralty as well as a section of Nathan Road in Mong Kok came undone within minutes of them being made. The swift change in plans highlighted a split in strategy among the tens of thousands of demonstrators occupying parts of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, blood was spilled in street brawls in Mong Kok between Occupy Central protesters and their detractors. Accusations flew that police had failed to allocate enough manpower to protect peaceful protesters and sided with anti-Occupy supporters, many believed to have links with triad societies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I'm worried something unpleasant will happen if the protests drag on, although I don't want to see any force being used," Cheng said. "The longer the protests last, the more dangerous the situation will become."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng said the police were justified in using tear gas to disperse crowds on September 28 as some protesters charged at police codons. He is one of the few Beijing-friendly heavyweights to come out in defence of the handling of the protests by the government and the police.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng believed there was interference by foreign forces in the pro-democracy protests that paralysed parts of the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Where does the money and the abundant supplies of food for protesters come from? Can you believe it just comes from sympathisers of the campaign?"</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheng, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's </span><span class="s3">Congress</span><span class="s1">, said there was still room to make the method for electing the 2017 chief executive more democratic within the restrictive framework set down by the NPC Standing Committee in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Our federation is open to the idea of expanding the electorate base of the nominating committee," he said. "In the election of committee members representing the labour subsector, we have no objection to the idea of granting the voting right to all trade union members."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, one of China's largest global asset buyers of the past five years, has reshuffled its senior management team following the death of a co-founder, as it continues a process of unwinding its acquisitive business strategy to align with Chinese government priorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which owns a range of assets from China's fourth-largest airline to hotels, promoted Chief Executive Officer Adam Tan Xiangdong to chairman of the group's overseas unit HNA International, a position left vacant by the demise early last month of Wang Jian. Tan, 51, will continue as CEO of HNA Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang was HNA's de facto top decision maker before he died on July 3 from an accident during a business trip to France. After his passing, HNA's co-founder Chen Feng was named group chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These changes will help us meet our commitment to refocus around our core aviation and tourism and logistics businesses,” Chen said in a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/02/82b81f02-962d-11e8-acb0-2eccab85240c_image_hires_194325.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several other promotions and appointments were made in the group. Chen Chao was named executive chairman of HNA International and chief investment officer of HNA Group, succeeding Wang Shuang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yang Guang, who previously signalled his intention to leave HNA for a new business venture, stepped down as president of HNA Group North America and as a trustee of the Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation, a custodian of the controlling shares of the closely held group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Every senior manager and shareholder of HNA is required by the company's charter to donate his shares of the company to Cihang upon death, co-founder Chen said in an interview with the South China Morning Post last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Ling, Chen Xiaofeng, Chen Chao and Liu Daoqui were elected to the board of directors of Swissport, which HNA bought in 2015 for US$2.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Exclusive Interview: HNA's founder calls fugitive Guo Wengui's patronage claims ‘a pack of lies'[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2099887/hnas-founder-calls-patronage-claim-pack-lies]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new line-up of senior management does not provide any clarity to HNA's decision-making process or shed light on the company's ownership, said Brock Silvers, managing director at Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai based investment advisory firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Who holds the 15 per cent voting right in </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, that was previously owned by Wang Jian?” Silvers said. “The company said the stake would be transferred to Cihang. But who are using the voting rights?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1"> has snapped up an estimated US$40 billion of assets since he began on its shopping spree in 2015, driven partly by its founders' ambitions for the group to be among the world's 100 biggest companies. Much of all that shopping was financed by borrowings, raking up US$90 billion of debt, with 27.4 billion yuan (US$ 4 billion) of bonds due to mature in 2019, Bloomberg data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That all came to a stop a year ago when China's financial regulators ordered HNA and other asset buyers like Anbang Group and </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1"> to cut their borrowings, unwind their positions. Beijing was worried that the shopping binge had been backed by risky financing channels that created a web of interwoven debt that involved mainland financial institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/02/a00005ac-962d-11e8-acb0-2eccab85240c_image_hires_194325.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since late last year, HNA had been busy downsizing, selling its stakes in </span><span class="s3">Hilton Worldwide Holdings</span><span class="s1"> for US$1.1 billion, a 25 per cent stake in Spain's </span><span class="s3">NH Hotel Group</span><span class="s1"> for US$726 million and an office tower in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for US$320 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the group has sold three prime plots of land at the site of the former Kai Tak airport for a combined HK$22.2 billion, after owning them for a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It bought four plots in the area for a total HK$27.2 billion between November 2016 and March last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have seen a tremendous amount of divestments in the earlier months, but everything they sell for now is just a small step in the right direction,” said Silvers. “The firm will face debts due in 2019, and its survival remains to be seen.”</span></p>
