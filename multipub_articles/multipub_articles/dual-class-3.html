<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asia Pacific Investment Partners (APIP), the Hong Kong-based real estate developer, is to launch a full initial public offering in London next month, on the SME-dominated alternative investment market (AIM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which invests and develops properties primarily in Mongolia, has applied to list its entire share capital to trade on AIM, which allows smaller firms more flexibility than London's main stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">APIP plans to use the funds raised, on further expansion of its real estate portfolio, including Mongolia's middle-income residential market and providing mortgage loans to individuals and businesses in Mongolia, according to Lee Cashell, its chief executive officer, for which it has a licence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further down the line there could also be expansion into Myanmar and other emerging markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have spent the last 15 years in the Mongolian market,” Cashell said. “We believe the group is now well positioned to capitalise on the strong growth opportunities in the Mongolian economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">APIP's revenue rose in the first half of the year to US$1.36 million compared with US$1.02 million in the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has developed around 53,000 square metres of real estate across five developments in the country's capital Ulaanbaatar, and holds eight plots of land on which it believes it can build a further 450,000 square metres.We believe the group is now well positioned to capitalise on the strong growth opportunities in the Mongolian economyLee Cashell, its chief executive officer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its real state assets in Mongolia were estimated to be worth US$312.8 million, according to DTZ </span><span class="s3">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">APIP said it has “strong growth underpinned by current and near-term projects, future planned projects and development and growth of prime land bank at attract cost”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cashell first indicated back in October 2012 he planned to float the company in Hong Kong by early 2014, so the shift in choice could be cause for concern for HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong still leads the world's IPO market, but unlike </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> it operates under the principle of “one share, one vote”, which prevents companies with a dual-class structure from floating their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong represented 22 per cent of worldwide listing funds in the first nine months of the year with 40 issuers, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data. London accounted for 3.6 per cent with nine IPO issuers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In recent weeks, the hottest topics on the minds of Hong Kong and mainland residents have been the opening of two major infrastructure projects, Hong Kong's high-speed rail connection[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2163423/sacrifices-hong-kong-made-high-speed-rail-mainland] to the mainland and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2171825/hong-kong-asks-guangdong-authorities-investigate].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the nation marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2170136/chinas-reform-and-opening-can-keep-delivering-miracles-says-xi], these connections are official steps to form a "one-hour living circle[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1817579/success-rail-link-hong-kong-china-mainland-depends-joint?page=all]” between Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau, and will usher in greater movement of people, goods and services between the cities. As the nation continues to reform and open up, Hong Kong could play a more proactive, flexible role in integration with the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back on the past 40 years, Hong Kong and mainland China have developed in complementary ways, and both sides are indispensable. Since the early days of reform and opening up, when Hong Kong and Macau accounted for 80 per cent of foreign investment in China, Hong Kong has always served as a bridge between the mainland and the international community. China took 40 years to modernise, a process that would have taken many other countries more than a century, and Hong Kong has been there every step of the way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said: "We are a contributor as well as a beneficiary in China's reform and opening up[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2170636/hong-kong-eager-play-bigger-role-chinas-further-reform-and].” In the process of reform, Hong Kong has always built on its strengths to support the country's needs. For example, Hong Kong has stepped up efforts to drive innovation and technology[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2154652/carrie-lam-promises-more-support-new-economy-and-tech-after-hong-kong-learns] in recent years, setting aside some HK$50 billion from its budget to support development in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, fintech and other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against this backdrop, the Hong Kong stock exchange reformed its listing regime[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142536/hong-kong-exchange-accept-listing-applications-under-new-rules] to allow firms from innovative sectors and companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong. It resulted in the Hong Kong listings of Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2154346/xiaomi-shares-fall-hong-kong-trading-debut-us-china-trade-war], Meituan[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2164966/meituan-dianping-shoots-past-42-top-hong-kong-firms-market-value] and other mainland tech firms. The listings not only bring more investment, but will also promote Hong Kong's understanding of mainland internet companies and inspire young people to join the tech sector. This is a prime example of the synergy that can be created between Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our closest neighbouring city, Shenzhen, is the best testament to China's reform and opening up. In 40 years, Shenzhen has made great advances in economic development, and arrived at principles known as the "Top 10 Concepts of Shenzhen”. The most widely known are "Time is money, efficiency is life” and "Innovation encouraged and failure tolerated”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, these concepts can be brought into play in many aspects of the country's development, especially with regard to flexibility in policy implementation. For example, many Hongkongers find it a hassle to seek employment on the mainland given the restrictions, and this has been the concern of many members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In response, the state has issued a series of policies to improve the employment environment[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2159989/new-id-card-will-give-hong-kong-macau-and-taiwan-residents] confronting residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the mainland. Residents of the three areas can now join the mainland's housing fund scheme, be exempt from work permits, and enjoy tax breaks in Hengqin[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2162170/hongkongers-working-mainland-china-face-being-taxed-their], a special economic zone in Zhuhai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of course, as everyone knows, Hong Kong and Shenzhen are in different stages of development, and both cities have different strengths in terms of urban management and industrial development, which is why there is still plenty of room to learn from and be inspired by each other. Today, Shenzhen and Hangzhou[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2152935/hangzhou-chinas-answer-silicon-valley-hit-returning-graduates] are full of vitality, thanks to rapid development in hi-tech industries and flexible policies. Hong Kong's present achievements are built on its rapid development in the past, and have benefited many people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I truly believe that in the deepening of the country's reform and opening up, Hong Kong can be more integral to the development of the country, so that Hong Kong's youth can continue to access a wealth of opportunities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Tsang Chun-wah, former Hong Kong financial secretary and chief executive aspirant in 2017, has embarked on a new chapter, one that he has promoted since his time in office - fintech investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He was last week named vice-chairman of Ion Pacific, a fintech focused merchant and investment bank, and is now poised to be appointed as chairman at BVL, a fintech company that has developed technology that lets merchants verify the identities of customers using the latter's smartphone telecommunication data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang, who is also an investor in the company, believes the technology will help to promote e-commerce. “The BVL technology will be safer and better than current methods such as passwords, biometrics and facial recognition,” he said, adding that banks, merchants and telecommunications companies had shown interest in the technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former financial secretary John Tsang joins fintech-focused merchant bank Ion Pacific [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2149705/former-financial-secretary-john-tsang-joins-fintech-focused]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While he did not disclose his investment, Tsang said the company was yet to generate revenue as it was still in the process of setting up. But BVL has completed the technology development stage and Tsang was in the process of approaching banks and merchants with the service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-born and raised, Tsang is the city's longest serving financial secretary. He held office for a decade until 2017 and guided the city through the 2008 global financial crisis. He resigned in late 2016 and ran for the post of Hong Kong chief executive in early 2017, eventually losing out to Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked if he would run for chief executive again, Tsang said: “I will not look back, as I have already moved on to a new chapter - and fintech will be my new focus.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Interestingly, it was during Tsang's tenure as financial secretary that </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s listing was lost to New York. Tsang said he does not regret not giving special preference to the e-commerce giant, as companies with dual-class shareholding structures where banned in Hong Kong at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, went public in 2014. Hong Kong as only just started allowing such companies to list here, after the city introduced its biggest listing reform in 25 years in April.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What we have in Hong Kong is the rule of law, and a legal system that can't be changed because of one company. We can't move the goalposts,” said Tsang. “Someone said Hong Kong was conservative. Yes. Conservative is OK!”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said money was not a reason for him to get involved in banking and fintech. “Hong Kong has always been a good integrator. For instance, Ion Pacific focuses on Israel and fintech projects that will bring technology, talent and projects to the city,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Israel has a lot of technology projects, such as desalination. It will be good for Hong Kong to build links with Israel. China and the US have a lot of trade tension and it would be good if Hong Kong can build relations with more markets,” said Tsang.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, said it did not support a draft proposal to allow companies to issue weighted voting rights (WVR), a week after markets operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it would launch a second round of consultation on the contentious topic later this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SFC is of the view that Hong Kong's securities markets and reputation would be harmed if WVR structures became commonplace,” the SFC said in a statement on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On his website, shareholder activist David Webb said: “This should kill it, as all changes to 8listing rules must be approved by the SFC.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC decision puts it at loggerheads with the HKEx over an issue many in the business community supported, hoping it would lead to greater deal flow and fee income. The debate was revived last year after Alibaba jilted Hong Kong in favour of New York, where dual-class share-holding structures enshrining minority control are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder raised concerns about the integrity of Hong Kong's securities markets if the listing rules were amended.This should kill it, as all changes to 8listing rules must be approved by the SFCDavid Webb,shareholder activist</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Would fund managers apply a ‘governance discount' to stock prices, or adjust portfolio weightings away from Hong Kong?” he said. “Will the WVR proposal be the magic bullet that would cause listing hopefuls to choose Hong Kong over a foreign stock exchange?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC said the draft proposal did not explain how many proposed safeguards and conditions could be monitored on an ongoing basis and what actions could be taken by regulators or public shareholders if they were not complied with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of large international fund managers, including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> and BlackRock, have warned that dual-share structures could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week: “The second-stage consultation on weighted voting rights structures should consider the balance of investor protection and maintaining our competitiveness, as answering with a simple yes or no would be premature.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange said yesterday the SFC's view would “be material” to the proposal put forward for second-stage consultation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would add GoGoVan to the litany of voices clamouring for </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd</span><span class="s1">. (HKEX) to establish a new board for start-ups and technology companies to raise capital in the city. The bourse operator is overseeing a public consultation on its proposal to divide the new board into two segments called the New Board Premium and New Board Pro, segregated by investor-protection standards commensurate with risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong had been missing out on the surge in initial public offerings (IPOs) by technology companies, which tripled in value to US$18.87 billion in the first eight months of 2017, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data. Asia's third-largest equity bourse by capitalisation wasn't even among the top 10 of technology IPOs during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan's success disrupts not merely Hong Kong's business, but also social strata norms[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2110104/gogovans-success-disrupts-not-merely-hong-kongs-business]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue are Hong Kong's listing rules, which currently don't allow start-ups and companies with dual class chares -- common in many technology companies -- to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX's plans for a new board would "set a foundation for GoGoVan to consider an IPO seriously," Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan, founded in Hong Kong in 2013, merged with 58 Suyun -- the freight haulage business of </span><span class="s3">58.com</span><span class="s1">, mainland China's answer to </span><span class="s3">Craiglist</span><span class="s1"> -- two weeks ago to have a valuation of more than US$1 billion, a "unicorn" in the lexicon of the venture capital industry. The merger's investors include private equity funds </span><span class="s3">KKR &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> and New Horizon Capital, as well as technology companies Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding. Alibaba also owns the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, a stock listing is not the endgame for GoGoVan, which Lam founded with Nick Tang Kuen-wai and Reeve Kwan Chun-ma. The merged company, using the name GoGoVan in English and 58 Suyun in Chinese, plans to extend its reach to 200 more Chinese cities. It will start offering services to corporate clients in 40 mainland cities, and step into more Southeast Asian markets in the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">GoGoVan to become Hong Kong's first US$1 billion start-up after merger with 58 Suyun[https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2108658/gogovan-become-hong-kongs-first-us1-billion-start-after-merger-58]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the merger, GoGoVan hopes to ride on the boom in China's logistics market, which surpassed the United States in 2015 as the world's largest, estimated at US$1.6 trillion according to iResearch[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1709505/000104746917004222/a2232277zf-1.htm#de46701_industry_overview]. Growth is expected at a compounded rate of 2.1 per cent per year from 2016 to 2021, iResearch said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are a lot of courier companies in China," said Lam. "A lot of them are big. We are building a logistic network that can support whatever movement in the cities."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said GoGoVan had focused on business to business operation in eight cities in China, working with bicycle-sharing firms, convenience stores and logistic hubs . "That part was growing really fast in China," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam, 31, has already been in talks with Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao online shopping platforms on different projects. GoGoVan was among the first batch of start-ups to get funding from Alibaba ‘s Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, a non-profit initiative.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"By the time we know it's the right time to talk to Alibaba," said Lam. "We definitely think it's a good partner down the road. Just look at the business scope, there s lot of ways we can work together and provide value to each other."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam grew up in a public housing estate in Hong Kong before moving to the US for higher education. "Our culture is quite similar [with 58 Suyun]," he said. "The mindset of service quality in Hong Kong I guess is still a little different from China. How we bring that quality level to China would be part of the integration that I focus on."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, the first overseas-listed biotechnology firm to seek a secondary flotation in Hong Kong under revised listing rules, dropped 5 per cent at the start of its trading debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the Beijing-based cancer drug maker, which is already listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, fell to HK$103 from the offer price of HK$108 early on Wednesday morning. They later bounced back slightly to HK$105.7.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The poor debut performance came despite eight cornerstone investors - including the Singaporean sovereign fund GIC - buying a combined 31 per cent of the international shares offered.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> is the second biotech firm to float its stock in Hong Kong under new rules that came into effect in April. Both have got off to a bad start on the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Biotechnology companies are new to investors in Hong Kong. They have not yet made any profit while some may not even have any revenue,” said Gordon Tsui Luen-on, managing director of Hong Kong-based brokerage Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The poor performance of the first two biotechnology firms will have a negative impact on the other six biotech companies which have filed for listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They have also come at a bad time, as the overall market sentiment has been hard hit by the ongoing US-China trade war.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">'s offering was met with lacklustre demand, with the retail tranche - 9 per cent of the total shares on offer - only achieving an oversubscription rate of 1.7 times.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It managed, however, to attract some strong cornerstone investors, who took up half of the international offering, which was “moderately oversubscribed”. This helped the company to price its shares in the middle of its indicative range to fulfil its HK$6.83 billion fundraising plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is definitely a very important market as our company starts to commercialise our products. A listing in Hong Kong will expand our investor base and brand awareness in Asia,” said Howard Liang, chief financial officer of BeiGene, at the time of the offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong bourse in April carried out the biggest overhaul of its listing rules in 25 years in a bid to attract giant technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures - shares that carry different voting rights - and biotechnology firms that are yet to generate revenue to list. So far, two biotech firms have listed and six more have submitted applications.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, the first early-stage biotechnology company to list in Hong Kong under the new regime, debuted a week ago, and saw its shares slide 32 per cent in the first three days to close at HK$10.02 on Friday.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, which recently carried out its largest listing reform in 25 years with the aim of becoming a hub for technology companies, reported a record net profit for the first six months of 2018 as a result of higher market turnover and new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX said on Wednesday its interim net profit stood at HK$5.04 billion (US$642.1 million) or HK$4.07 per share, up 44 per cent from HK$3.49 billion a year earlier. This is the highest half-year profit since the exchange was established and listed in 2000. It is also higher than the 37 per cent profit growth to HK$4.8 billion estimated by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After deducting first-quarter profit of HK$2.56 billion, net profit for the second quarter from April to June stood at HK$2.48 billion, up 40 per cent from a year earlier and beating Nomura's estimate of 22 per cent year-on-year profit growth to HK$2.16 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the first half of 2018, the world's financial markets experienced bouts of volatility following significant corrections across major stock markets. Investor sentiment was dominated by uncertainties over escalating US-China trade tensions, geopolitical risk in several parts of the world and policy divergence of major central banks. Lingering uncertainties are likely to cast a dark cloud over global markets for the remainder of this year,” said Laura Cha Shih May-lung, chairwoman of HKEX, in her first interim results statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the world enters a new era of fintech, there will be many opportunities as well as challenges. At HKEX, an innovation lab was established to explore the increased use of emerging technologies in various parts of our business, both operationally and strategically,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse's trading and clearing fee income was boosted by rising average daily turnover, which increased 67 per cent to HK$126.6 billion in the first half, compared with HK$76 billion in the first half of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee income rose as 108 companies launched IPOs in the first half, up 50 per cent from 72 last year, after the HKEX in April started accepting dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotech firms without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/08/fec6023e-9949-11e8-9a20-262028f49e8a_image_hires_125134.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's board said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$3.64 per share, up 43 per cent from HK$2.55 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect scheme linking Hong Kong with mainland China exchanges brought in revenue of HK$365 million in the first half, more than double the HK$162 million a year earlier. Funds from mainland Chinese investors into Hong Kong stocks now represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of market turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a large pipeline of ‘new economy' listings which, in our view, could change the market dynamics and structurally lead to higher turnover,” said York Pun, an HSBC analyst, in a research note before the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX traded at HK$229, up 1 per cent, at the midday close before the earnings announcement during the lunch break. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will meet the media in the afternoon to discuss the results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's three-year run of growth in the city's listings market will switch into reverse gear next year, reports say, as deal sizes get smaller.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Professional services firms EY and KPMG forecast that Hong Kong's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market will raise HK$200 billion from up to 120 companies next year, against about HK$225 billion in 109 deals this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The projected smaller scale of the initial public offerings reflects that most of the mainland's state-owned enterprises have listed over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reports may give ammunition to those market participants wanting to see an end to the city's ban on controversial dual-class share structures. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is conducting a consultation on whether to amend its listing rules to accommodate structures that give shareholders the same financial benefits but with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation was prompted by mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's move to bypass Hong Kong for New York, where exchange officials agreed to allow its senior managers to have greater voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the global IPO rankings for 2014, Hong Kong ranked second after the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which hosted Alibaba's record-breaking US$25 billion sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO market has never returned to the heights seen in 2010, when it raised a record HK$449 billion from 101 listings in 2010, thanks to </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$22 billion dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital in Asia will return to the US markets once the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> starts to raise interest rates, Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY, said in a briefing on the report yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Choi believes that Beijing is considering loosening its grip on the full circulation of H-shares, which should translate into higher trading volumes as the overhang of non-tradeable shares is removed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [full-circulation of H-shares] scheme, if fully implemented, should attract more institutional investors to invest in mainland companies listed in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> is reviewing the full circulation of locked-up Hong Kong shares, with relevant documents to be released next year, EY said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's approval for such a move means that restricted shares issued by a mainland company can be traded in full outside the mainland and denominated in foreign currencies, such as the Hong Kong dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2005, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> was given special permission from Beijing to list with this arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at KPMG, said financial firms would be the major IPO driver next year, reflecting their need to meet tougher capital requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Robert Lee Wai-wang, executive director of Hong Kong-based broker Grand Finance Group, said he was upbeat on the earnings prospects for HKEX in the second half in spite of global political and economic headwinds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market turnover of HKEX in the second half of this year may be affected by the poor market sentiment. The US and China trade war may continue to haunt markets. Interest rate rises would also have an negative impact. However, the listing reform could bring in more technology firms and biotech companies to list. The long-term outlook of HKEX remain positive,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will hold a press conference in the afternoon to discuss the results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's financial industry professionals are still divided over how they can remake the city's stock exchange to make it the world's most attractive place for startups and technology firms to raise capital, even as the first round of a public consultation process drew to a close on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited</span><span class="s1">, the operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation and overseer of the consultation, has proposed the establishment of a third board to provide a listing avenue for companies with dual share structures, as well as those with no profit track record. Accountants, bankers, brokers and lawyers are divided over whether a third board is needed, in addition to the existing main board and the growth enterprises market (GEM) for startups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/18/da1bea5a-83ee-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_163241.JPG]"We received a lot of comments already, and we expect to receive more," said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited, the bourse operator overseeing the process. "If the market supports, we will have another round of consultation of detail regulations. If all would gain support, I would hope to see the new board to start in the first half of next year," said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, at the exchange result briefing last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake is how Hong Kong can make its bourse attractive enough as a fund-raising destination in competition with New York, Shanghai or Singapore and other global markets, especially for startups and so-called new economy companies in financial technology, e-commerce and biotechnology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies raised US$5.8 billion in Hong Kong through initial public offerings during the first six months of this year, a decline of 19.5 per cent compared with the same period in 2016, when the city was top of the league table for new listings worldwide, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The companies that raised funds in the city were dominated by the financial industry, accounting for 59 per cent of funds raised during the period, while technology companies raised the equivalent of 0.8 per cent, the data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/18/20bd598a-83ef-11e7-a767-bc310e55dd10_image_hires_163241.JPG]The loss of appeal to technology was the factor that unseated Hong Kong from the top of last year's league to third place. New York took the crown in the first half, with companies including Snap Inc raising a combined US$18.2 billion. Shanghai was the second largest, with US$9.6 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further illustrating Hong Kong's lack of appeal to new-economy companies, the Shanghai Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange, or Lufax, obtained a license to operate its financial technology business in Singapore, instead of Hong Kong, a stone's throw from the base of its parent Ping An Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed third board will comprise two parts. One is a so-called premium market open to all investors, hosting companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but with a dual-class share structure currently disallowed on the main bourse. The second is the so-called pro market focused on startups where only professional investors with higher appetite -- and understanding -- of risks are allowed to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposals are taking the wrong direction entirely to improve Hong Kong's markets," said David Webb, founder of the activist shareholders' platform Webb-site and former HKEX director. Hong Kong doesn't need a new board, and he favours "a single board, under a single statutory regulator, combining listing and takeover regulation, and not the four-board mess that HKEX advocates," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stockbroker community support the new board, provided it has enough protections for shareholders, said Benny Mau, chairman of the city's Securities Association, an industry guild.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the industry watchdog agency, said it's open minded, either way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC keeps an open mind to listen to what the market says about the new board," the agency's chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said in response to inquiry by the South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology, China's largest health care and online medical platform, is to raise US$1 billion from an initial public offering in Hong Kong and will be traded in early May, after it got a verbal go-ahead by the city's bourse, sources said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen-based financial conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) will spin off the health care and technology unit, which is also known as “Good Doctor”, for the IPO, which will value it at US$5.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's revenue rose by 240.4 per cent to 1.02 billion yuan (US$162.2 million) in the last nine months of 2017 from a year earlier. But it still lost 497.4 million yuan in the same period, after a net loss of 614.2 million yuan during the first nine month period of 2016, according to an application prospectus published on Hong Kong bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An gears up for IPO of its health care tech unit on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2131088/ping-gears-ipo-its-health-care-tech-unit-hong-kong-stock-exchange]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The potential IPO has already attracted major shareholders, including Softbank Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund, and Vision Fund Singapore SPV, both of which have a 7.41 per cent stake in Ping An Healthcare, according to the document.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The joint sponsors are Citigroup Global Markets Asia and JPMorgan Securities (Far East). Proceeds from the listing will be used for business expansion, potential acquisitions and the development of an artificial intelligence assistant and other technologies, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched in April 2015, Ping An Healthcare offers online medical services and has 192.8 million registered users, with network coverage that includes 3,100 hospitals and 7,500 pharmacies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was China's largest internet health care platform in terms of average monthly active users and daily average online consultations in 2016, according to the US consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frost &amp; Sullivan has forecast China's internet health care market to grow to 197.8 billion yuan by 2026 from 10.9 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange is pushing ahead with IPO reforms to allow weighted voting rights for technology companies from June, in an attempt to attract more new economy companies to list and keep its status as a global financial services leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shares are favoured by founders and certain shareholders who want to retain more voting rights than other shareholders, and critics have argued that such a structure might lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare's issued share capital is split into A shares (77.2 per cent) and class B shares (22.8 per cent). But it will have only one class of ordinary shares upon the completion of its share redesignation, the application said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Poor performance by newly listed stocks is undermining Hong Kong's ambition to rival the United States as a hub for technology flotations, and Chinese technology companies are once again favouring US listings, according to </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong emerged as first choice after the city's bourse operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, in April carried out its biggest reform in 25 years, according to John Hall, co-head of investment banking coverage and technology, media and telecommunications (TMT), Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, the largest bank in the US in terms of assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Before the reform, 90 per cent of Chinese technology companies chose to list in the US. After the reform, nine out of 10 Chinese technology companies chose to list in Hong Kong,” Hall said in an interview during the bank's annual TMT Conference last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But more than six months later, the trend is shifting back to the US. "Now it has gone down to about five out of 10 that choose to list in Hong Kong, and the rest want to list in the US. The post listing performance of these companies shows Hong Kong does not have a deep pool of investors like the US,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, 2018 has been the strongest year ever for China technology IPOs. And after HKEX approved listings by dual-class shareholding companies as well as biotechnology companies without revenue, Hong Kong attracted dozens of applications and IPOs such as that of Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But share performance has been disappointing. Four out of the five companies that listed under the new rules either reporting a flat trading debut, or fell on their first trading day, according to Bloomberg. Long-term investors too have lost out, with five stocks falling 20-56 per cent below their listing prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market performance of some of these IPOs in Hong Kong was hit hard by volatility. This has led some Chinese technology companies to opt for listing in the US, where there is a deeper investor base for technology companies,” said Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the US was also more flexible when it came to pricing an IPO and successfully executing smaller deals. "In the US, a small offering of US$200 million is completely doable. Hong Kong tends to require larger sized offerings,” said Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong has the potential to catch up. "Hong Kong investors understand the China market better than US investors, although they have less knowledge of the technology sector and less experience valuing fast-growing businesses,” said Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong remains a very attractive place for companies to go public. Having 50 per cent of technology firms want to list here is very good. If the share performance of IPOs improves, Hong Kong may get 70 per cent of Chinese technology firms to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong reclaimed the crown of No. 1 IPO market worldwide[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165850/hong-kong-regains-crown-new-york-no-1-market-raising-funds] in terms of funds raised by all companies in the first nine months this year. But US exchanges raised US$18.31 billion year to date until Friday through 49 TMT flotations. Over the same period, Hong Kong raised US$14.67 billion through 29 TMT listings, according to Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the five-year period between 2013 and 2017 before the HKEX reform, the US reported 264 TMT listings, raising a total of US$94.52 billion, far more than Hong Kong, which reported only 90 such IPOs, raising US$10.58 billion, according to Refinitiv.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jennifer Nason, global chairman for investment banking at </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">, was optimistic about the IPO market and said next year onwards a number of blockbuster technology IPOs, including those of Uber, Ant Finance and Lufax, could take place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many innovative start-ups in Asia and China that need to raise funds for their development. When the market is down, they may delay for a while. But if they wait too long, the price may get even lower,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Companies with the right assets can go ahead with their listing plans to raise funds to expand their business. They may need to accept lower valuations now, but the fundraising could help enhance their competitiveness for the longer term,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US [had] dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them [were] IT companies. In Hong Kong only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business, August 30</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some people just don't know when they are well off. In my view, one of the strongest arguments for banning distorted voting rights in listed companies is that it helps keep those wretched IT companies off our market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, I know that some of them have been spectacular winners. But for every Apple Corp there are a hundred sinkhole stocks in information technology. Let the venture capitalists have them, I say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the ordinary investor and for the reputation of the stock market nothing beats boring companies that do boring things. They make you money. IT loses you money. Don't believe me? Welcome to poverty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And let's get it straight about Alibaba, too. The Hong Kong exchange was actually willing to listen to the plea that its founders be given preferential voting rights but insisted they would have to feel at least some of the pain of their smaller shareholders if things went wrong. You've got to put some skin in the game, said the listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba wouldn't have it. The game the founders wanted to play was "heads I win, tails you lose". The committee quite rightly showed them the door, upholding the principle that all questions of democracy have long been settled in Hong Kong - A shares have the same voting rights as B shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But now we have our exchange officials dismayed that Alibaba made good on its threat and is listing in New York instead. Maybe we should allow high-powered B shares after all, they say in a consultation paper, wringing their hands all the while - "The Exchange has formed no view for or against Weighted Voting Rights".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Uh-huh. I see. Is that also true of your boss, fellows?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the key question here is one that this paper only touches on briefly. It is that investor protection in New York goes well beyond regulators who may, and then again may not, have more than the greater glory of their exalted selves in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What investors have in New York is two very good tools for wringing compensation from market brigands who have robbed them. These two are class-action lawsuits and contingency fees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you believe you have been cheated, you can join your lawsuit to those of others who are taking the same case to court, and you can make arrangements with the lawyers handling the case that they will only be paid if they win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's in New York, where people live in the 21st century. Our own lawyers in Hong Kong still live in the 18th century and will have none of it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Class-action lawsuits are not allowed and lawyers who accept contingency-fee payments can be sent to prison for it. It's called champerty, a horror in the eyes of our judges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus all we have in Hong Kong if things go wrong is the Securities and Futures Commission, which cannot always get your money back for you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two essential legal reforms that could possibly make preferential voting rights worth considering here have been rejected outright.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have even been made a crime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Abandon all hope ye who think things may change. They won't. Our lawyers are dead against it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They see a threat to their income and, as we have an overweighting of lawyers in the </span><span class="s3">Legislative Council</span><span class="s1">, the sky will fall in before champerty is recognised as a legal virtue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In these circumstances I can't for the life of me understand why the exchange bothers putting out a paper soliciting views on preferential voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To introduce such a thing in the absence of class-action lawsuits and contingency fees is to put a noose over the head of the small investor and the rope in the hands of any bandit who happens by.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just forget it, fellows. If you can't change the lawyers' rules, then don't change your own.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has paved the way for a listing in the United States, with a spokesman for the mainland e-commerce giant saying yesterday that both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq had accepted its special partnership structure, which would let its top executives nominate the majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two bourses had formally accepted Alibaba's partnership structure, which derailed its initial public offering (IPO) plan in Hong Kong, the spokesman said, adding: "We just want other people to understand the partnership structure is an open, innovative, responsible and sustainable system for a company's fundamental needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another Alibaba spokesman said last night that the company had not yet selected an exchange or appointed underwriters for a US listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong regulators had said there was no provision in listing rules that allowed preferential treatment of one group of shareholders over another.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's a pity that Hong Kong lost out on this iconic internet giant being listed in the city, but the Hong Kong stock exchange, as a regulator as well, had to safeguard the interests of minority shareholders," said Linus Yip Sheung-chi, strategist at First Shanghai Securities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future, the California-based electric car start-up founded by Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting, said on Monday that its largest shareholder </span><span class="s3">Evergrande Health Industry Group</span><span class="s1"> had deliberately withheld promised payments and prevented it from seeking alternative financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The development comes after Evergrande accused FF of trying to scrap the original stake sale deal after spending the initial investment of US$800 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande Health, a unit of the Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group, announced in June that it would buy a 45 per cent stake in FF for a total investment of US$2 billion, as part of the group's diversification plan into the hi-tech industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the deal, Evergrande fully acquired Season Smart, which owns 45 per cent of the joint venture that controls FF - Smart King. Through Season Smart, Evergrande has already made an initial investment of US$800 million in FF. It also agreed to pay another US$1.2 billion in two equal instalments in 2019 and 2020 respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Evergrande said the EV start-up had started assembling its first high-end car, FF91, at its US production base. FF also set up an operating headquarters in China for research and development and production in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, in an exchange filing on Sunday night, Evergrande said FF demanded another US$700 million in July after spending the initial investment of US$800 million, following which it signed another agreement with the start-up to pay this US$700 million under certain “payment conditions”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While “the payment conditions had not been fulfilled”, Jia “manipulated” his majority board seat position to begin an arbitration against Evergrande at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre on October 3, 2018, the filing said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jia was seeking to deprive Season Smart of its shareholder right to approve any future financing plan, while also trying to terminate all the other agreements with Evergrande, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said that it has already fulfilled its obligations under the relevant agreements and that the arbitration has “severely damaged” their rights and interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Season Smart has engaged a team of international lawyers and will take all necessary actions to protect Season Smart's continuing rights under the relevant agreements, and to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF responded on Monday afternoon denying the accusations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Contrary to what has been reported, Evergrande failed to make any of the promised additional payments beyond the original US$800 million, despite FF and its CEO complying with their obligations and meeting all required conditions for funding under the July 2018 agreement,” FF said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Instead, Evergrande held the payments back to try to gain control and ownership over FF China and all of FF's intellectual property. At the same time, Evergrande is preventing FF from accepting any immediate financing from other sources.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF denied either Jia or anyone else had “manipulated” the board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The start-up said Evergrande had a full understanding of why and when FF needed the additional US$700 million, which is to achieve production and delivery of FF91 in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the only reason ‘FF is trying to get out of the deal with Evergrande' is because Evergrande has failed to live up to its end of the bargain and make the payments it agreed to make … Evergrande shouldn't be permitted to withhold the funding and simultaneously prevent FF from accepting alternative financing or investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FF added it will continue to take actions, including pursuing other funding opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in Evergrande Health briefly skidded 37 per cent at Monday's open, before paring losses to 16.4 per cent, to close at HK$8.78. Evergrande Group also lost 6.3 per cent to end at HK$20.95.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, Evergrande Health has gained 90 per cent from the level before the June announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future is considered key to Evergrande Group's electric car ambition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hui Kayan, chairman of Evergrande Group, said in April the group plans to invest 100 billion yuan (US$14.5 billion) in the next 10 years in a wide range of hi-tech sectors like life sciences, AI, robotics, and alternative energy. Electric cars are an important part of the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evergrande said in August that Faraday Future aims to reach an annual production capacity of 5 million vehicles by 2028. The Chinese unit of Faraday Future has already been set up in Guangzhou city, with a registered capital of US$2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, Evergrande Group invested 14.5 billion yuan for a 41 per cent stake in Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment Group, one of China's largest car dealers. The investment has been regarded as an effort by Evergrande to pave the way for Faraday Future's car sales network in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although Evergrande Health became the largest shareholder of the joint venture, it has less voting right than Jia because of the dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on the June agreement, each share Evergrande Health owns equals one vote compared to 10 votes for each share held by Jia. Consequently, Evergrande Health only has 12 per cent of the voting right. Jia, who owns 33 per cent of the company, controls the rest of the voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, the agreement has a special clause, which stipulates that if the management is unable to perform its duties, Jia's voting rights will be reversed to Season Smart. It would result in a full control of Faraday Future by Evergrande Health.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Faraday Future was founded in 2014 by Jia, chairman and CEO of the debt-saddled technology conglomerate LeEco.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this year, Jia defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to China and said he needed to stay in the US to focus on Faraday Future. He said his brother and wife had been empowered to handle matters relevant to the company.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking at HKEx's interim results we were struck by a paragraph in the chairman's statement which said, "We never lose sight of our responsibilities as an exchange controller, a regulator as well as a listed company". Although chairman Chow Chung-kong says he never loses sight of this triple responsibility, one thing he doesn't seem to see is the conflict of interest that is inherent in this arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a listed company HKEx is duty-bound to maximise profits for its shareholders. The executives and management are incentivised to work to this end, hence their juicy bonuses. But as regulator it is not focused on maximising profits but is, or should be, more concerned with running a fair and orderly market and maintaining high listing standards. It's not hard to see the conflict here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed this dilemma was nicely encapsulated by the debate over whether or not Alibaba should be listed in Hong Kong. The pain at the exchange for having let such a milch cow slip through their fingers was palpable. They were at a number of meetings to try and get round the vexed issue of Alibaba's dual-class shares. In one of his blogs HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia observed that one share, one vote, has a nice ring to it and, "if we only care about reputation, this approach will certainly help to maintain Hong Kong's nominal regularity purity". But this position has a price. "If this becomes a trend, Hong Kong could lose a huge franchise for good," referring to the possible loss of new China listings to the US exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chow's recent chairman's statement gave no inkling as to how this problem was to be resolved. He simply says, "Therefore, we will continue to review our regulatory regime with a view towards upholding market quality, and we will explore further collaboration with our stakeholders to drive sustainable performance in the economic, social and environmental dimensions of our industry." Clearly this issue has not gone away.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There seems to have been a falling-out between Hong Kong businessman Balram Chainrai and his erstwhile partner Levi Kushnir. The two bought English football club Portsmouth after it came out of administration in August 2010. But Chainrai has recently taken out a writ in Hong Kong's High Court in which he is demanding 29.5 million Israeli new shekels (HK$66.7 million) from Kushnir, together with Kushnir Family Holdings, Israel Sorin Shochat, and Yaacov Liraz, all of whom are based in Israel. The suit relates to loan agreements between Chainrai and Kushnir Family Holdings between June 2005 and February 2006 which the writ says were guaranteed by Levi Kushnir. Vaacov Liraz acted as a legal adviser to Chainrai during this period. The writ alleges conduct amounting to breach of contract, negligence, breach of fiduciary duties, collusion or conspiracies to defraud Chainrai and breach of professional codes of conduct.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jobs galore</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Demand for professionals in Asia remains brisk according to headhunters Robert Walters. Its Asia Job Index tracks advertisements for professionals. These grew 28 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year. In Hong Kong job adverts for legal and compliance professionals rose 33 per cent as a result of the continued tightening of the regulatory environment. This also created demand for accounting and finance professionals, with advert volumes up 29 per cent. Companies are apparently devoting more time and effort to retaining staff as the economy stabilises, and therefore adverts for human resources roles increased 25 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have a brand new market next year for “new economy” companies, allowing companies ranging from start-ups and technology firms with dual share structure to list, according to a consultation paper by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> released on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal, announced in the paper to collect views over the next two months, recommends that the new board will not accept any traditional or old economy firms, but only those classified as technology or new economy firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This will be the first market in the world that restricts the types of companies allowed for listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has a main board which currently requires companies to make a combined profit of HK$50 million (US$6.42 million) in the three years prior to the listing. The second board Growth Enterprise Market does not require a profit track record but companies have to have HK$20 million in annual cash flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Neither the main board nor the GEM has attracted many technology firms to list. Of the HK$19.4 billion raised by initial public offerings in the city last year, 69 per cent was accounted for by financial firms, with just three per cent from technology companies, far lagging behind the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and Shenzhen's ChiNext.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Out of Hong Kong's total market capitalisation, financial or property companies account for 44 per cent, while new economy firms only make up a mere three per cent. This pales in comparison with the 59 per cent on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> and 44 per cent on the </span><span class="s3">NYSE</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our IPO market is now dominated by traditional companies, while we have few new economy companies listing. The proposed new board is aimed at attracting new economy companies from the mainland or other international markets to list here,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX in a briefing on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope these new economy companies now already listed in the US or other markets would consider a secondary listing on the new board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Disallowing firms with dual share structure to list in Hong Kong is part of the reason companies have shunned the city for the US. With a proposed third board, Hong Kong may be able to compete for the US$49 billion raised in the US in the past 10 years, which represented 17 per cent of all IPO funds raised in Hong Kong during the same period.The proposed new board is aimed at attracting new economy companies from the mainland or other international markets to list hereCharles Li, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Singapore and London are considering allowing dual class share firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's proposed new board will have two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target technology or new economy companies that meet the main board listing requirements, but have a dual share structure. US-listed companies with dual share structure would also be allowed to apply for a secondary listing on the premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> adopt such shareholder structures as their founders hold minority stakes but want to retain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But firms will face trading suspension if they failed to properly disclose financial information or if the exchange consider them unsuitable to be listed. They will be delisted on the premium market if they were suspended from trading for six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Retail investors could also trade in the premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The other market in the new board is designed for start-up companies. Neither profit nor turnover records would be required and the regulation would also be a light touch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There would be a delisting requirement where after a certain period of time, if these companies fail to meet certain operation requirements or if their share prices drop to certain threshold, they would be delisted. Firms that have been suspended from trading for 90 days will be delisted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is an easy in, easy out concept for the start-ups to raise funds easily, but they would also be easily delisted unless they work hard to prove that they have a business case,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since the risks of these start-ups would be high, the start-up market would be restricted to professional investors to trade only,' he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, said the new board would be popular with start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, there would be challenges of defining what companies are qualified as new economy, for them to apply to list on this new board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation paper also made recommendations to the GEM and the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The role of the GEM will be redefined as a market tailored for small- and medium-sized companies that do not meet the main board listing requirements and are not technology or new economy companies. All listing candidates should launch initial public offerings instead of private shares placements that are currently allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, GEM would be removed as a stepping stone to the main board, as the minimum market capitalisation for firms will be lifted from HK$100 million to HK$150 million, with annual cash flow requirement to be increased from HK$20 million to HK$30 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the main board, changes proposed include raising the minimum market capitalisation of firms from HK$200 million to HK$500 million and the minimum public float from HK$50 million to HK$125 million, as well as extending the lock-up period from one to two years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks rose the most in three years on Monday, boosted by gains in Chinese financials amid expectations Beijing would slow down its deleveraging campaign if trade tensions with the United States affect the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 2.5 per cent, or 67.88 points, to 2,815.11, while the CSI 300 Index, which tracks large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose by 2.8 per cent, or 94.06 points, to 3,459.18. The increases recorded by both indexes were their biggest since May 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose by 1.3 per cent, or 372.88 points, to 28,688.50, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed by 1.4 per cent, or 145.73 points, to 10,768.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock market rebound came from a very sharp previous drop, and the US not hitting back at China with even bigger tariffs over the weekend,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “The key resistance level for the [Hang Seng] benchmark index will be in a range of between 29,000 and 29,500.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, signs pointed to the US taking a softer stance towards China, with Washington taking a break from further escalating its trade war with Beijing after both countries fired their first salvoes last week, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">office of the US Trade Representative</span><span class="s1"> announced an exclusion process for Chinese products subject to Section 301 tariffs, seeking to lessen the blow for US companies. And judging by China's retaliatory tariffs on a range of US agricultural goods so far, the mainland seemed to be avoiding an escalation in trade tensions too, said analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> advanced by 1.8 per cent to HK$70.95, </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2 per cent to HK$6.94 and the </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> gained by 1.5 per cent to HK$5.61.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And while smartphone maker Xiaomi, the first company with a dual-class share structure to list in Hong Kong, closed 1.2 per cent below its listing price, at HK$16.80, on its trading debut, technology related companies fared well. Internet giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> rose by 2.4 per cent to HK$396, </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology (Group) </span><span class="s1">rose by 2.2 per cent to HK$145.1 and </span><span class="s3">AAC Technologies Holdings</span><span class="s1"> was 1.1 per cent higher at HK$107.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts widely expect the US to impose tariffs on US$50 billion worth of imports from China; and in a bearish scenario, there is a risk the duties could expand to hit a further US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods.The key resistance level for the benchmark index will be in a range of between 29,000 and 29,500Linus Yip, First Shanghai Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As international trade conflicts flare and cause significant stress to the Chinese and global economy, domestic policy easing is likely to step up and offset the pain, according to Helen Qiao, China and Asia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A set of Chinese growth data to be released this week is expected to be a critical test for the local markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, the Shenzhen Composite Index rose by 2.5 per cent, or 38.56 points, to 1,574.54, while the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">-style ChiNext rose by 2.5 per cent, or 38.56 points, to 1,574.54.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other Asian markets also rose on Monday. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained by 1.1 per cent, or 264.04 points, to 22,052.18. South Korea's Kospi was up by 0.6 per cent and Australia's All Ordinaries Index edged up 0.2 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the world's fourth largest smartphone supplier, reported a surprise profit for the quarter ended June 30, assuaging recent concerns about its ability to grow and join the league of China's biggest internet companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's performance was in line with our internal expectations, but beyond external expectations,” chief financial officer Chew Shou Zi said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday after the market closed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based company posted a profit of 14.6 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion) in the second quarter, rebounding from an 11.9 billion yuan loss a year ago, on the back of higher smartphone sales volume and average selling price for these devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sales grew 68.3 per cent to 45.23 billion yuan, up from 26.9 billion yuan a year earlier, beating the market's 38 billion yuan consensus estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Has Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi lived up to its pre-IPO hype?[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2160753/has-chinese-phone-giant-xiaomi-lived-its-pre-ipo-hype]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, which sells mostly budget-priced handsets, said its smartphone business recorded revenue of 30.5 billion yuan in the second quarter, up 58.7 per cent from the same period last year, on total shipments of 32 million units.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion from its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong last month, were up 1.61 per cent to close at HK$17.68 on Wednesday. That was around 19 per cent down from its high of HK$21.55 on July 18.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the strong second-quarter performance, Xiaomi could bolster investor confidence for its business model, which company founder and chief executive Lei Jun described in June as a “triathlon” of hardware, e-commerce and internet services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not everyone had agreed with Lei's internet-business narrative ahead of Xiaomi's public listing last month. The Chinese securities regulator asked Xiaomi whether the firm considered itself a hardware or internet company, while international institutional investors questioned the valuation which they thought was high for a hardware company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eight years ago, I came up with a crazy idea, which was to build a smartphone business based on the business model of an internet company, transforming the global image of ‘Made in China' products and benefiting everyone across the globe with amazing products at honest pricing,” Lei said in a statement on Wednesday. “The interim results that Xiaomi announced today prove that this idea has become reality.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi was the first company to be listed in Hong Kong with a dual-class shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts see Xiaomi building up its market position in the so-called of Internet of Things (IoT) market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the past few years, Xiaomi has built a unique integrated internet-hardware ecosystem that acquires users by selling high-quality products and monetising user traffic, a virtuous circle that underpins long-term growth,” CCB International analyst Ronnie Ho and Rocky Zhang wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi reported that revenue from its IoT products, including smart television sets and laptop computers, increased 104.3 per cent in the second quarter to 10.4 billion yuan. Revenue from internet services, which include online advertising, rose 63.6 per cent to 4 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company was still in the early stage of development for its own finance business, according to Chew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid a saturated market in China, Xiaomi has been sharpening its focus on India, the world's second largest smartphone market, and across Europe.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi introduced on Wednesday a separate mobile phone brand, Poco, to take on industry leaders </span><span class="s3">Samsung Electronics</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1"> in the premium segment of the global Android handset market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The push towards the higher end of the smartphone market comes at a time when the major Chinese brands have squeezed international brands in the mass market segment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's top four smartphone brands - </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1">, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - had a combined global market share of 39 per cent in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Samsung</span><span class="s1"> led the industry during that quarter with a 20 per cent share, while Apple slipped behind second-ranked </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> with an 11 per cent share. Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo ranked behind the iPhone maker.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following its IPO in Hong Kong, Xiaomi set a goal to further expand worldwide. It wants to have overseas markets account for more than half of its annual revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Xiaomi remains committed to a business model that puts a 5 per cent limit on the profit margin of every piece of hardware - from smartphones to suitcases and ballpoint pens - that it sells, certain expenses ballooned in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It reported a 4,469 per cent jump in administrative expenses to 10.6 billion yuan last quarter, which was mainly attributed to the one-off share-based compensation of 9.9 billion yuan awarded to Lei before the company's IPO.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April, bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) introduced its biggest listing reform for 25 years with the aim of turning the city's stock exchange as a listing hub for technology and biotechnology companies which now are mainly listed in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the reforms have yet to work their magic for the exchange as only two companies have successfully listed so far. Biotech firm </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1"> made its debut on August 1 and smartphone maker Xiaomi in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three types of companies can apply. Technology giants with dual class or multiple class shareholding structure; biotech firms without profit or revenue; and innovative companies currently listed in the US or the UK seeking a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rules[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124972/securities-commission-backs-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong] apply to only tech or new economy companies with multiple voting rights shareholding structure, usually with two different classes of shares. Each share held by the premium class of shareholders - mostly the founders and other key executives - can have up to 10 times more voting rights than the others. No corporate shareholders are allowed to hold the premium class of shares. The company must have a market value of at least HK$40 billion (US$5.1 billion) at the time of the listing, or market cap of HK$10 billion and annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech candidates need not comply with the profit requirements of the main board, which stipulates at least HK$50 million of profits in the three years leading to the listing. They also do not need to have any revenue track record. However, they must have a market valuation of at least HK$1.5 billion at the time of listing, one “sophisticated” pre-IPO investor, a product that has passed phase one clinical trial primarily aimed at showing its safety, and has regulatory approval to begin phase two to prove its efficacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech firms must already be listed on one of the three qualifying exchanges - </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. They also must have a market cap of over HK$40 billion, or market cap of HK$10 billion and annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While initial public offerings by technology unicorns - start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion - such as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology</span><span class="s1"> have attracted hoards of retail investors looking for a quick profit, venture capitalists such as Rebecca Lin Rui have kept a cool head.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This despite the prospect of upcoming IPOs offering her company, Eight Roads Ventures, an opportunity to exit its investments at a handsome profit.Eight Roads is a proprietary investment unit of fund management company </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1"> that has backed internet companies such as Asiainfo and </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> , which owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following a listing reform introduced last week, Hong Kong now allows flotations by companies whose founders and key managers want to retain control through dual-class share structures, as well as biotechnology companies that do not have any revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The best ways of climbing aboard the biotech investment bandwagon [http://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2141590/best-ways-climbing-aboard-biotech-investment-bandwagon]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This has paved the way for many companies, which would not have otherwise listed in Hong Kong, to appear on the radars of local investors, who are mostly unfamiliar with biotechnology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Globally, the investment enthusiasm for Chinese biotech firms is unprecedentedly high,” Lin, who leads Eight Roads' China health care venture investments, told the Post in an interview. “For us, I'll ask if there is really good science and good entrepreneurs to build world-class companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The enthusiasm for biotechnology was supported by a sweeping industry reform in China aimed at making it internationally competitive. The industry regulator, China Food and Drugs Administration, has published dozens of policy circulars in the past 18 months to simplify and speed up the clinical trials of new drugs and their commercialisation approvals, as well as to incentivise new and generic drugs development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this all should also be backed by sound fundamentals, said Lin, who is a partner at Eight Roads.“There is too much attention on quick exits and IPOs,” she said. “We are not too concerned about the hype … we only focus on early stage start-ups and our focus is on value creation together with the companies.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms [http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A major reason why Eight Roads has been able to take a long-term approach with its investments is the fact that all of the money it invests belongs to its parent, </span><span class="s3">Fidelity International</span><span class="s1"> , freeing it from external investors' pressure to take profit and distribute returns regularly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eight Roads first invested in China's health care sector as early as 1995, when it bought into Pharmanex, a manufacturer of “nutraceuticals” - foods with medicinal benefits, such as vitamins and minerals.Since then, it has ploughed more than US$480 million into 33 companies in China's health care sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Eight Roads probably has the biggest exposure to China's health care sector as a single investor,” Lin said, declining to reveal the current market value of its portfolio and its strategy for exiting investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China had very few dedicated health care institutional investors before 2005, and health care-only funds only emerged about three years ago, which included a US$250 million fund set up by Eight Roads last September.The company plans to invest about 40 per cent of the sum in innovative drug development, 40 per cent in health care services and information technology, with the remainder for medical technology such as diagnostic devices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why Hong Kong is in a sweet spot to harness Chinese biotech listings [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2129628/why-hong-kong-sweet-spot-harness-chinese-biotech-listings]We are not too concerned about the hype … we only focus on early stage start-ups and our focus is on value creation together with the companiesRebecca Lin Rui, partner, Eight Roads Ventures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eight Roads' investees span the entire supply chain of the health care sector, from drug developers such as listing hopefuls </span><span class="s3">Innovent Biologics</span><span class="s1"> and diabetes-focused </span><span class="s3">Hua Medicine</span><span class="s1"> , through to medical devices makers and oncological clinical data platform operator Medbanks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company even funded the construction of Delta Health, a hospital in Shanghai specialising in cardiovascular surgeries and care.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This diversification has allowed Eight Roads to help its investees form strategic business partnerships.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Focusing on its role of founding investor in most of its investees, Lin said Eight Roads' investment journey has been “quite challenging but rewarding”, as it has helped them attract talent, find investors and strike strategic cooperation deals with partners.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin did not disclose the returns track record of Eight Roads, only saying it was “far higher than industry returns”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For a venture capital and private equity investment made in 2015 in the health care sector globally excluding the US, the average return was 25 per cent by the end of September last year, according to data collated by </span><span class="s3">Cambridge Associates</span><span class="s1"> .</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the local bourse operator, is expected to post 11 per cent net profit growth for the first half of 2017 as a result of better market turnover and higher volume of derivative trading, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX is expected to report on Wednesday that its second quarter net profit grew 3 per cent to HK$1.6 billion, or HK$1.34 per share, according to consensus of analysts polled by Bloomberg. They expected revenue for the quarter would be up 7 per cent to HK$3.09 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Add the already announced first quarter net profit of HK$1.72 billion and the bourse operator's first half profit is expected to reach HK$3.32 billion, up 11 per cent from HK$2.99 billion in the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First half revenue is expected to grow 10.98 per cent to HK$6.248 billion, up from HK$5.6 billion in the first half of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the first half of 2017 the average daily turnover was HK$76 billion which is up 12.6 per cent year on year from the first half of 2016. The higher market turnover brought in better fee income which contributes to the profit for HKEX," said Kenny Wen, a wealth management strategist at </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Financial</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The volume of derivative products trading also reach a record high level in the first half of this year which also brought in higher fee income," Wen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time for Hong Kong to define the ‘new economy' amid talk of third board at stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2105149/time-hong-kong-define-new-economy-amid-talk-third-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX earns fee income from investors on stock and derivatives products trading as well as from listing fees paid by listed companies. It also earn fee income from commodities trading from its wholly owned subsidiary </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which is the world's largest metal exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds raised through initial public offerings in the first half totalled HK$53.6 billion, an increase of 23 per cent when compared with HK$43.6 billion for the same period last year. In terms of numbers, there were 72 newly listed companies in the first half, up 80 per cent when compared with 40 for the same period last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific, said the higher number of new listings and the stock connect programmes have brought in higher revenue to the exchange.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since the launch of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock connect from December and the removal of the total quota for the stock connect scheme, we have seen more fund flows from mainlanders buying Hong Kong stocks in the first half. Mainlanders now account for about 10 per cent of all turnover of the Hong Kong stock market which boosts fee income for the exchange," Tsui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsui said the launch of bond connect on July 3 and the two new gold futures contracts on July 10 would bring in more revenue to the exchange in the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter the exchange already reported a better than expected 20 per cent growth in its net profit to HK$1.72 billion, which was boosted by a one-off HK$55 million interest payment from the liquidation of </span><span class="s3">Lehman Brothers</span><span class="s1">. Excluding that, it still reported profit growth of 16 per cent to HK$1.67 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will host a briefing on Wednesday to discuss the results. The market will also be keen to learn more about the progress of the new third board planned for next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange is seeking consultations until August 18 on a proposal to introduce a new board to attract more technology companies to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board would consist of two markets. The first is a premium market open to all investors, hosting companies that meet the eligibility requirements for a main board listing but which have a dual-class share structure currently banned on the main exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second market will be focused on start-ups and would be limited solely to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange is also keen on convincing </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to list in Hong Kong, expected to be the largest initial public offering worldwide, raising US$100 billion. Markets expect the Saudi Arabia oil company to sell 5 per cent of the firm, valuing the business at US$2 trillion. New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo are in the race to capture the listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah Mobile, the fast-growing security software business of Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft, plans to raise about US$300 million in its initial public offering in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Cheetah, formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software, intends to list its shares on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, according to its filing on Wednesday with the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said the net proceeds from the share offering would mainly be used to strengthen its research and development, sales and marketing, and international expansion efforts. It did not provide the number of shares to be sold or the price range of the offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Established in 2009, Cheetah provides free-to-download applications that include mobile security software Clean Master and mobile power booster Battery Doctor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CCB International said in a report last month that those popular apps offered plenty of commercial opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah posted a net profit of 62 million yuan (HK$78 million) on revenue of 750 million yuan last year. Under its business model, the firm mainly generates revenue from its more than 380 online marketing partners, the biggest of which are Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a separate filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday, Kingsoft estimated that its 54.09 per cent shareholding in Cheetah will be diluted to about 47 per cent after the spin-off is completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah has proposed adopting a dual-class share capital structure that would allow Kingsoft to retain control and continue to consolidate the unit's financial results after the IPO. This type of share structure is not available in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a company with less than US$1 billion in revenue in its last financial year, Cheetah also qualifies as an "emerging growth company" under US law, meaning it can take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laurence Li Lu-jen, who takes over as chairman of Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council, said on Tuesday listing reforms and other measures introduced by the government recently had enhanced the city's competitiveness as a financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li was speaking in the immediate aftermath of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's flotation in Hong Kong, which only raised US$4.72 billion instead of the expected US$10 billion. It also meant the city was unable to reclaim its crown[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2153456/ipo-crown-eludes-hong-kong-xiaomi-does-not-live-its-blockbuster] as the world's top IPO market - it ranked third globally in the first half of 2018, the same as last year.We cannot control how the market reacts to reformsLaurence Li Lu-jen, incoming chairman, Financial Services Development Council</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The council does not focus on the ranking of IPO markets. We support the listing reform introduced by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, and believe it is working in the right direction, promoting innovation and technology development in the city,” Li, a barrister, told a press conference. “We cannot control how the market reacts to reforms,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li was appointed by the government on Friday and will assume the post of chairman[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2153461/veteran-insider-set-head-hong-kongs-finance-industry] on Wednesday, taking over from Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who in April became the first woman to chair bourse operator HKEX. He will be in office until January 16, after which he will continue as the chairman of the council, which will be incorporated as a company, for another two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joining the council in 2013, Li has been pushing for reforms such as those introduced this year by the HKEX, allowing companies with dual-class share structures and biotechnology firms with no revenue to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he would continue to promote financial technology and investor protection in his new role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the tough tasks ahead is turning the FSDC into an incorporated company early next year, which will allow it to have more resources and hire professionals for research and promotion,” said Li.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council currently relies on government secondment or voluntarily staff for research and promotion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, who was present for the press conference, said she had known Li for more than 20 years, since their time together at </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> in the early 1990s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the past five-and-half years, the council has completed 35 reports on how to promote Hong Kong as a financial centre. I believe Li will continue to lead the council, to work further to promote Hong Kong,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is expected to trade close to the 7.85 weak-side convertibility undertaking through 2019 because of rising volatility in the currency amid a string of initial public offerings and strength in the US dollar, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar traded at 7.8487 per US dollar late afternoon on Monday after previously falling to a low of 7.8499, approaching the threshold for the monetary authority to intervene in the currency markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under its currency board system, the de facto central bank is obliged to buy or sell the Hong Kong dollar to keep it within a range between 7.75 to 7.85 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange points may be more influenced by short term events than before, such as IPOs,” Ronald Man, fixed income and currency emerging Asia strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> said in a recent research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure Xiaomi locked up about HK$23 billion (US$2.9 billion) in subscriptions in June. China Tower, the world's largest operator of transmission towers for mobile phone networks, is also planning to raise as much as HK$68.1 billion in an IPO, the biggest such sale globally in nearly four years. Retail investors can subscribe to the offer from Wednesday until next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But any banking liquidity squeeze is likely to ease once the IPOs are completed. That would widen back the US-Hong Kong interest rate gap, attracting currency traders to sell the Hong Kong dollar for the higher yielding US dollar and exerting pressure on the local currency, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One-month Hibor was at 1.8 per cent on Monday, down 33 basis points from a 10-year high of 2.13 per cent hit on June 25, when it briefly closed its gap with its US Libor counterpart for the first time since 2017. On Wednesday, the gap widened back to 21 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While interest rates on various fixed deposits have risen in the past months, the city's commercial banks in Hong Kong have yet to raise their prime lending rates. The Hibor rate is likely to stay below Libor as liquidity in the city is likely to stay relatively supported, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has been raising benchmark rates in lockstep with the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> since the current tightening cycle got underway in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In interventions in April and May, the monetary authority spent around HK$70 billion to support the Hong Kong dollar, which has tightened the amount of dollars in circulation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, inflows into Hong Kong dollar assets and commercial banks that continue to refrain from raising the prime lending rates have partially offset the liquidity drain, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around the region, markets are poised for more weakness in Asian currencies, including the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar, said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy at </span><span class="s3">United Overseas Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong US growth and rising inflation indicators reinforce the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s gradual rate hiking path, boosting the US dollar and Treasury rates, Heng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">DBS Bank</span><span class="s1"> forecasts three-month Hibor to rise to 3.25 per cent by the end of 2019, up from Wednesday's 2.07 per cent level while three-month Libor was expected to hit 3.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has abandoned plans to sell shares anywhere in the near term in a bid to let the heat die down over its controversial share-structure proposal, chief executive Jonathan Lu Zhaoxi told the South China Morning Post yesterday, leaving the door open to a Hong Kong listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We decided to put down the issue after the last round of discussions," Lu said in an interview at the company's Hangzhou headquarters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong may need some time to understand the creative management structure for a creative company," he added, in a sign that the potential HK$100 billion share deal has not yet been permanently lost to the city in favour of an alternative listing venue. We decided to put down the issue after the last round of discussions JONATHAN LU, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ALIBABA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There appears to be movement on the Hong Kong side too, with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia saying in his blog yesterday that consideration should be given to "non-standard shareholding structures" for "innovative companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his blog on HKEx's website, Li said there were "a wide range of possibilities that could be considered" when deciding whether or not to let innovative firms' founders have extra power to influence the nomination of the majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proponents of the structure have argued that such an arrangement would preserve the long-term vision, ideas and strategies of company founders - many of whom would have seen their interests diluted after rounds of external financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But opponents said this could open the door for the largest shareholders to harm minority shareholders' interests when their interests were not aligned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has been trying to convince Hong Kong regulators to permit a partnership structure allowing its top management to nominate the majority of its board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, stressing that he was expressing his personal views to further the debate, said whether a partnership structure was allowed or not was not core to the issue, because regulators would look through any partnership to the underlying structure and persons involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"You are a shareholder, director, or manager, or all three; whether or not you are a 'partner' is of little relevance," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"What is trickier is how to structure founders' influence on senior management appointments without encroaching on the fundamental power of directors to appoint the leadership on behalf of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We should have a proper debate before making a decision ... we should make the decision proactively."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said greater concessions could be allowed for founders in markets with stronger checks and balances, such as the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In a less institutionalised and less litigious market such as Hong Kong, such concessions, if given, would need to be moderate and come with checks and balances for use in the event of abuse or true conflict," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, listed firms are allowed to have "dual-class" shares, where founding shareholders are allowed extra voting rights on key company matters. In Hong Kong, shareholders have equal rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li suggested that minimum market capitalisation, public float and shareholding requirements for founders should be considered if special rights were given to founding shareholders, "to maintain a healthy counter-balance of power".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He emphasised that he was not representing the view of HKEx's listing committee, which has the primary role in deciding whether to reform current regulations, subject to the oversight of the Securities and Futures Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An SFC spokesman declined to comment yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants said the episode highlighted the conflict of interest inherent in HKEx's dual role as the commercial operator of the exchange and a regulator setting rules for listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Li hit back, saying: "This is not about one listing candidate or fees earned from a listing here or there, it is about choosing a future path and all the responsibility that entails."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Post reported last month that sources close to Alibaba, founded by teacher-turned-entrepreneur Jack Ma Yun, had said there was no rush to float shares this year and that the real objective was to get a deal done by the end of 2015. If a deal was not done by then, it would likely mean a renegotiation of an agreement struck last year with major shareholder </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> over the terms under which the mainland firm could buy back some of the stake held by the US internet company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's chief strategy officer, Zeng Ming, said yesterday the results of the last round of discussions were not good because the company had underestimated the complexity of negotiations with the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We felt we were wronged," Zeng said. "I think, more than anyone else, Jack felt he was wronged. He was so full of enthusiasm and full of hope towards Hong Kong. But above all, we felt that we hadn't done well enough on our side."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Alibaba had made Hong Kong its top priority when choosing a listing venue. "But we haven't fully discussed with the SFC or exchanged ideas with them in the past," he said. "We have relied too much on the lawyers of both sides to discuss issues on a technical level."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will launch a new stock trading system next month, as it upgrades the bourse infrastructure to handle rising volumes and turnover that is approaching HK$200 billion (US$25.5 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be hard to predict if this daily turnover level will be the new normal,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX, at the media lunch on Wednesday. “We are now back to the turnover seen in 2015, but we believe the current market situation is more sustainable than it was in 2015.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even though turnover reached HK$198.9 billion on Tuesday, it is still some distance away from the record high of HK$293.9 billion achieved on April 9, 2015. The average daily turnover in the first three weeks of the 2018 stood at HK$152 billion, almost double the HK$88.2 billion in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rising turnover comes as the benchmark Hang Seng Index continued to set new all-time highs last week, thanks to the capital inflow from mainlanders via the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock connect schemes. Mainlanders now represent between 6 to 10 per cent of daily market turnover in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the record turnover in 2015 was driven by the rally of A-share market, which dropped substantially when the mainland's markets crashed in the summer of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He, however, expects the current trend of increasing turnover in Hong Kong will be sustained for a bit longer because the rally will last longer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new trading system will help to cope with the rising trading volume. The Orion Trading Platform can handle up to 60,000 transactions per second, twice that of the current system and has the capability to be expanded further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The system will go live on February 5, replacing the AMS/3.8 system which has been in use for 17 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The turnover is expected to increase further as HKEX is in the process of launching its ever largest listing reform in three decades to allow large biotech companies with no revenue and giant dual class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong from June. The new measures are expected to attract more mega IPOs of technology and new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Completing the listing reform is one of our priorities in order to secure our relevance as a premier global capital formation centre,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have already received some enquiries about listing under the new regime and we are targeting to complete the consultations regarding details on the rule changes by the end of this quarter.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started the upgrade of its trading infrastructure in 2012 and the introduction of Orion is the last stage of this programme that has led to the setting up of a world-class data centre among others.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The head of Hong Kong's Science Park, Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fun, has been forced out of the job by the city's leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor after four years at the helm, the Post has learned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law, who had brought a number of reforms to the park, wrote to the board of directors informing them that she would step down next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source told the Post that it was not her own decision to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Post has contacted the Chief Executive's Office for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law, whose actions last year sparked accusations of interference in the academic freedoms of one of the world's top medical universities and which required Lam[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] to intervene, was named chairwoman of the publicly owned Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) in 2014. She was appointed by Hong Kong's previous chief executive, Leung Chun-ying[http://www.scmp.com/topics/leung-chun-ying-0].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Her predecessor, Nicholas Brooke, had been in the post for six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The news of her departure comes with the government pouring billions of dollars into developing the city's innovation and technology sector and a pledge by President Xi Jinping last month to make Hong Kong a global innovation hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a letter to the park's board of directors, Law recognised the efforts of her colleagues but warned that the park still had to seize opportunities to speed up development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Thanks to your great effort, HKSTP can be proud of the achievements over the years. Together we have made Science Park a genuine research and development base, where we nurture technology entrepreneurs and foster cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional collaboration,” Law wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said a number of things would facilitate the park's work. They included new Hong Kong stock exchange listing rules - which permit dual-class shares, a system favourable to technology companies and their founders - HK$50 billion (US$6.4 billion) in funding to boost IT development[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2135127/hong-kongs-science-park-take-lead-driving-innovation-and] allocated in the government's budget, an enhanced internship scheme, a new channel for importation of technology talent and the increasing enthusiasm among investors for technology products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is still a lot to be done to capitalise on the favourable environmental factors. However, I am confident that, under the leadership of a highly professional and dedicated senior management team, HKSTP will shine and make a big difference,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Like a plane that is gathering speed on the runway, Hong Kong is ready to soar as a global innovation centre! Add oil!”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law, who is also a member of Lam's cabinet, the Executive Council[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2099610/what-exactly-hong-kongs-executive-council-and-why-does-it], had been keen on attracting more research-based companies and had once mentioned that the park's occupancy rate should not be the only benchmark for performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from the Science Park in Tai Po, the corporation also operates three industrial estates in Tai Po, Tseung Kwan O and Yuen Long as well steering the development plan of the Lok Ma Chau Loop, an area on the border with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Law's leadership has not been without controversy. It is also understood that on a number of issues she holds different views from Secretary for Innovation and Technology Nicholas Yang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September last year, the vice chancellor of Sweden's globally acclaimed medical university Karolinska Institutet, which has a research branch in the park, threatened to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ole Petter Ottersen stressed in a blog post the need for its researchers “to carry on their activities in complete academic freedom”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources said the developments prompted Lam to write to the 208-year-old institute to reaffirm the city's respect for academic autonomy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Law rejected accusations of meddling in academic freedom, adding she made a last-minute fact-finding visit to the Karolinska Institute's Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine ahead of a trip to Stockholm to meet its dons. She had decided to do so because she did not want to visit the main outfit without knowing about its work in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet search giant Baidu, smartphone brand Xiaomi and Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft have agreed to subscribe with Cheetah Mobile, the security software company that plans to raise about US$200 million in its initial public offering in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts yesterday said that combined subscription, worth US$50 million, would help prop up the New York Stock Exchange-bound listing of Cheetah after the Beijing-based company - formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software - downsized its IPO from the original US$300 million that was filed earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah, a subsidiary established by Kingsoft in 2009, will offer 12 million new American depositary shares, each priced between US$12.50 and US$14.50. That would put Cheetah's market capitalisation at between US$1.8 billion and US$2.1 billion, according to its </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> filing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jeff Hao, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, said: "Timing is not on the company's side because Alibaba's own IPO will require a lot of capital from the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, the mainland's biggest e-commerce services provider, is expected to file for its share offering in New York within days. Speculation has been rife that Alibaba could raise more than US$20 billion, positioning its IPO as the largest in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1"> analyst Ricky Lai expected the Cheetah IPO to still manage to attract investors with a specific interest on the growing mobile security applications market segment. "Baidu's and Xiaomi's subscription deals would certainly help raise the company's profile," Lai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once its IPO is completed, Cheetah will issue and sell its Class A shares worth US$10 million to parent Kingsoft, US$20 million to Baidu and US$20 million to Xiaomi Ventures, the smartphone brand's venture capital unit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah has proposed adopting a dual-class share capital structure that would allow Kingsoft to retain control and continue to consolidate the unit's financial results after the IPO. This type of share structure is not available in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday, Kingsoft said the Cheetah IPO net proceeds will amount to US$147.4 million, or US$170 million if the underwriters exercise their option to buy additional shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah plans to use US$50 million of the proceeds to expand into selected international markets; US$35 million to build up its sales and marketing; US$35 million to invest in technology, infrastructure, and research and development; and the balance for general corporate purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock traders, get ready for a better year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">2018 was downright grisly for Hong Kong and mainland China markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But market watchers expect things will pick up.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1">, for example, predicts a 10 per cent rise in the Hong Kong market, while </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> forecast single-digit returns in the city. </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> says China will deliver a high single-digit rate of growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The big elephant in the room is the US-China trade war. A positive resolution could spark a rally in both Hong Kong and mainland markets, as beaten-down stocks look cheap and very eager to get up off the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any gain would be a far cry from this year, when the Hang Seng Index as of the close of Friday was down 15 per cent while the Shanghai Composite Index closed down 25 per cent, making it the worst performing major market in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's stock market needs to ditch its patchwork rules for a clean start at its watershed moment[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2175977/chinas-stock-market-needs-ditch-its-patchwork-rules-clean]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Combined, they suffered a market capitalisation loss of US$2.5 trillion, or roughly the gross domestic product of the UK in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those losses stung, especially coming off of 2017 - a terrific year for Hong Kong traders. The Hang Seng was the best performing major market in the world, with a run-up of 36 per cent. The Shanghai Composite gained 6.6 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We went from heaven to hell in the space of one year,” said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some traders trusted their gut and got out of the carnage early. Lu Shunxi, a Shanghai-based investment director at an asset management company, decided in June to take everything out of the market and pocket his 30 per cent gain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It felt awesome when the market plunged when it opened on the next trading day,” Lu recalls with a mix of pride and relief.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But others weren't so lucky.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anyone who held onto Chinese internet giant Tencent - the heavyweight on the Hang Seng - saw jaw-dropping losses. It had fallen 24 per cent this year as of Friday. That was after it soared to an all-time high of HK$475 in January, more than double from a year earlier. A Chinese government clampdown on gaming was partly to blame.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Hong Kong's more than 400 pension funds lost 5.9 per cent on average from January to the end of November, latest data by Refinitiv Lipper shows. Each contributing employee lost on average HK$14,139 (US$1,805) during the period, according to Convoy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The madness and fears in the market far exceeded my expectations,” said Nick Liang, chief executive of iMeigu Capital Management, which focuses on China's internet companies listed in Hong Kong and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘All parties must end'</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Things were looking perky at the kick-off to 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In January, the Hang Sang Index soared to an all-time high while Chinese stocks climbed to the highest level since the 2015 market crash, in line with US markets that charged ahead amid confidence in economic growth and tech stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the bull run came to an abrupt halt in February when fears about sharper interest rate hikes toppled the US markets, prompting a 10 per cent plunge of the Hang Sang Index in a short 12 days.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Index plunges 1,600 points amid ‘panic selling', as fear sweeps city after US market rout[https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2132166/hong-kong-traders-brace-market-plunge-after-us-stocks-meltdown]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tariff threats made by US President Donald Trump between February and March further weighed on market sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over 100 companies fell by the 10 per cent daily limit as China tech stocks rocked by news US urging allies to blacklist Huawei[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2174694/over-100-companies-suspended-trading-china-tech-stocks-rocked]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next hammering came in June, when Trump declared the US would impose a 25 per cent tariffs on US$50 billion of Chinese goods, prompting China to match with similar tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index slumped by more than 10 per cent within one month from a June high, while the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 12 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, China's economic indicators pointed to a slowdown. Growth of industrial output slowed and manufacturing activities stalled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More tariff proposals and trade talks that fell through in August and September accelerated the markets' declines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tech and other new economy stocks were among the year's biggest disappointments. Before its fall, Tencent moved from HK$200 at the beginning of 2017 to HK$475 in January of this year, in what Geo Securities' Lun calls the "biggest percentage gain in any blue chip in memory.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many people became millionaires because of Tencent, and fortunes rose and fell with Tencent,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I saw that all parties must end one day, so I sold all Tencent I had in March at about HK$430,” said Lun, who considered it his best trade of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Enthusiasm about such stocks was pushed to a climax when Hong Kong introduced historic listing rules reform in April, allowing companies with dual-class shares and pre-revenue biotech firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That gave rise to a surge in initial public offerings of new economy stocks such as smartphone maker Xiaomi and on-demand service giant </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong reclaimed its crown as the world's top IPO market in 2018, with a total of HK$278 billion raised, the most since 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the love affair with new economy stocks was short lived, as the slumping market made investors question their valuation. The Chinese government's unexpected policy to suspend new game approvals added to the pressure, pounding gaming companies like Tencent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of the third quarter, Xiaomi traded a third lower than its offering price and Tencent also slumped by one-third from its record high in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Worst times represent the best opportunities'</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many investors will be happy to sing Auld Lang Syne to say goodbye to 2018 and welcome in the new year. But why should 2019 be any better?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts point to attractive valuations, China's coming economic stimulus, and a possible end to the US-China trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even though volatility is here to stay, our advice is still to stay invested,” said Dennis Lam, an analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other are more cautious, suggesting investors wait on the sidelines for resolution of such things as the trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Han Chao, chairman of Shenzhen Basaltic Capital Management, describes his strategy for 2019 as "watch and wait until the end of next year”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market will have a better direction after a year of policy changes and political shifts,” he explained.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kenny Tang Sing-hing of China Hong Kong Capital Asset Management expects things will improve in the second half of the year, while Geo Securities' Lun says stay on the sidelines until March when he expects the Hong Kong and mainland markets to hit bottom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most experts say investors should stay glued to the US-China trade war, which will be one of the top defining drivers of markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A final ceasefire in early 2019 could drive "a multi-month rally in Asia ex-Japan equities led by those markets affected, namely Hong Kong, China and Korea,” according to Patrick Pan, an equity strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daiwa predicts the most likely form of a ceasefire will be something akin to a memo of understanding between the world's two largest economies. Without some sort of deal, Daiwa expects the market to be weighed down by a possible slowdown in the global economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beyond the trade war, investors may be able to find plenty of attractive opportunities because of cheap valuations and the top leadership's recent promise to provide policy stimulus for China's economy at the annual Central Economic Work Conference, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Valuations on the Hong Kong and China markets were at the lowest levels since early 2016 and 2015 respectively, measured by price-earnings ratio of the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite indices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Significant tax cuts in China through a new personal income tax law taking effect on January 1 will support consumer sentiment, thus benefiting consumer staples in Hong Kong and China, according to Pan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Higher government spending outlined in the policy meeting also "offered clear benefits” to the infrastructure sector as well as banks, which "already look inexpensive and offer attractive dividend yields”, according to Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Defensive tactics are likely to push up utilities and telecoms, according to Pan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even the slammed tech stocks could find a way to crawl back from this year's losses.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record number of Chinese tech and internet companies are rushing to launch IPOs overseas this year, amid the looming shadow of overall tightening credit conditions, which bears a lot of similarities to the dotcom bubble and crash of 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just like what happened in the US nearly two decades ago, many of these IPOs are pushed by the need for cash amid intense funding pressure, as the cheap money era is coming to an end after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> kicked off its rate-increase cycle and there is no sign of China ending its deleveraging campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it is getting increasingly harder to access onshore money from private equity funds, companies are turning to the public equity market for financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said many tech start-ups are trying to catch the last train in the current cycle like what the Chinese internet portals did in 2000, as the issue of survival has become all the more important when winter finally comes. To grab the window of opportunity, many would rather risk a valuation cut and stock volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If history is any guide, today's breed of tech and internet companies could face a similar turnaround in fortunes and experience traumatic changes, leaving only the fittest to survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, 13 Chinese tech and internet service-related IPOs launched this year, raising a combined US$6.86 billion as of September 21 - the highest on booth counts since 1995, according to Dealogic data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The data has not taken into account one of the largest flotations of the year - Xiaomi's US$4.7 billion IPO, which Dealogic categorised as a smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f17fde44-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO wave is part of an overall listing boom. In the first eight months of this year, 150 companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange, up 46 per cent year on year, based on data from the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is in sharp contrast to the market sentiment that has changed significantly from earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since July, nearly 60 per cent of IPOs have fallen below their offer price on the first day of trading. The eight biggest tech IPOs in the past 12 months are all trading below their IPO prices. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, China's biggest online car retailer, has seen its shares plunge nearly 70 per cent from its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index recently entered a technical bear market, reaching a low of 26,613 earlier this month, down more than 20 per cent from a high of 33,484 on January 26. It has since risen, closing at 27,788.52 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f1cfca08-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even retail investors' enthusiasm towards big listings has faded. Online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s IPO earlier this month was barely subscribed by retail buyers, who placed only HK$2.6 billion (US$332.2 million) worth of orders. That is less than one per cent of the HK$370 billion capital that Ping An Good Doctor tied up in its IPO in May. It also pales in comparison with China Literature's HK$520 billion lock-in retail capital last November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But bankers said the IPO window in Hong Kong is still open and will probably stay open for another year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect a healthy IPO pipeline in Hong Kong over the next six to 12 months, despite macro-driven market volatility,” said Sunil Dhupelia, head of equity syndicate for Asia ex-Japan at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese companies, primarily in the TMT [telecommunication, media, and technology] sector, feature prominently in the pipeline.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Hall, co-head of investment banking for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, had similar views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is still a robust IPO pipeline and the momentum is strong. Instead of postponing their IPO agenda, most issuers want to be prepared to catch the right market window. The recent volatility has made investors more selective but they remain tremendously enthusiastic for companies with a solid business model.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance, a leading home-grown investment bank advising on tech IPOs, said the window to list in Hong Kong is open, partly because of the new listing rules that took effect in April. The rules allow companies with dual-class share structure to list and also make it easier for biotech firms to launch their IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“2018 is a bumper year for IPOs. I believe next year will also be [the same],” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dennis Wu, CEO of Hong Kong-based Futu Securities, expected the current IPO boom to last till November and quieten a bit in December, before heating up again next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Hong Kong is among the top IPO destinations in the world and is an open market with free capital flows. “As long as the issuers are good companies at reasonable valuations, you don't need worry about the market's holding capacity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this unprecedented wave of IPOs has been fuelled by the rapid strides taken by Chinese tech firms in the past four to five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few years, many of these firms have made great progress supported by financing from private equity funds. They have matured and reached the IPO stage,” said Bao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin Sha, an analyst at China Industrial Securities, said China's mobile phone penetration rate had surged to 54 per cent in 2017 from 41 per cent in 2014, fuelling a rapid growth in the start-ups offering products or services related to the mobile internet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of these start-ups have seen explosive growth, attracting enormous amounts of private capital amid hefty expectations about their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is similar to how many big internet portals rose in the early 2000s amid the internet revolution back then,” she wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this year, the Chinese private equity market, an important source of funds for start-ups, has tightened significantly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first six months, money raised by private equity funds and venture capital firms plunged 56 per cent year on year on the back of China's ongoing deleveraging efforts, weak domestic equity market, and a slowdown in economic growth complicated by the impact of the trade war with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f21ac92c-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's really hard to access onshore money from private equity funds now,” said Ashley Li, head of asset management at Ping An Securities. “Many LPs [limited partners] have no additional capital to invest [in PE funds], and some even want to cash in on their existing investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Hong Kong-based Partners Capital International, said a large number of PE funds set up in 2013 and 2014 have reached their harvesting phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A PE fund usually has an investment period of three to five years before it exits the portfolio companies. That has caused many PE funds to take the companies they back to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the companies themselves, it becomes imperative to find other sources of funding when uncertainties are on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Tech companies usually need constant blood transfusion in the early stages when they are yet to make a profit and need to keep burning money to support their expansion,” Wan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When winter comes in the current capital market cycle, the most important thing is to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kai Fang, managing director and head of equity capital market at China Renaissance, said it is better for issuers to grab the window of opportunity sooner rather than later given the uncertainties, as long as the company meets the requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We don't know what will happen in the future. Maybe you can't sell [the IPO] at the highest price now, but the top priority is to get it done. No one can predict whether it will become better in the future. So why not now?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there are several motives behind a company's desire to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An IPO is so much more than just going public. It means a company can access more financing channels, boost its reputation and attract talent, and have a stronger bargaining position when talking to clients or even creditors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bruce Wu, co-head of </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1">'s Greater China equity capital markets group, agreed it is important to grab the window as long as it's open.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The volatility may cause issuers to recalibrate their timing, but they will persist with their plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This unprecedented IPO wave has rekindled memories of what happened 18 years ago when the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> crashed after reaching a peak of 5,048 in March 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting in June 1999, amid the dotcom boom, the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its benchmark rate six times within one year, from 4.75 per cent to 6.5 per cent in May 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around that time, the US stock market embraced a concentrated IPO wave. 115 and 112 companies went public in 1999 and 2000 respectively, compared to the annual average of 72 between 1991 and 1996, according to data compiled by China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's four biggest internet portals at the time - China.com, Sina.com, NetEase and </span><span class="s3">Sohu.com</span><span class="s1"> - also listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> from July 1999 to July 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the bursting of the dotcom bubble in March 2000 hit IPOs hard. Not only did NetEase and Sohu have to briefly postpone their listing plans and cut fundraising targets, but also saw their shares drop quickly as the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> plummeted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> lost nearly 80 per cent of its value from its peak to a low of 1,114 in 2002, a period which many people call as the internet's nuclear winter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list itself is a success,” Wang Zhidong, founder and then CEO of Sina, said in an interview with Beijing Youth Daily in 2000. “We caught the last train. The window was closing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Zhang, CEO of Sohu, was then quoted as saying that it was not as if the company would have died had it not listed. “But the IPO significantly increased our chances of survival.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2161035/xiaomis-share-surge-falls-victim-investor-worries-over-outlook]Eighteen years later, those comments resonate with Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list is a huge success for Xiaomi, given the volatility on the capital market,” Lei said in an open letter in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi raised US$4.7 billion in Hong Kong, the largest tech flotation of the year. But the fundraising value had to be cut by almost half from its initial target, as the company and banks became cautious amid a weak market and lacklustre investor interest. Its shares currently trade below its offer price, falling victim to worries over the outlook for Chinese tech firms and the US-China trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analysts agreed that what is going on now bears some resemblance to the past in terms of the funding environment for tech companies.In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will surviveBao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although I don't think it will be as destructive as the bursting of the bubble back then, we need to be aware of a possible sharp turnaround in expectations for the new breed of tech and internet companies,” Wan from Partners Capital said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a tech company mainly relies on burning cash to support its business without a viable business model, it easily dies when the environment becomes harsher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The end of the dotcom boom saw about 210 US internet companies go bankrupt because of the broken capital chain, as it was hard to access financing, according to data from China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the bubble in the tech sector burst in the 2000s, many companies experienced a painful transformation, as their valuations were reassessed,” said Lin from the Chinese securities firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those that survived bear three key characteristics: cautious investments, cost control, and how fast the company can monetise its traffic and achieve earnings, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fan from China Renaissance holds similar views, as he sees the ability to manage cash flows important to the survival of a tech company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will survive.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's equities bourses will temporarily bar mainland Chinese investors from trading companies with multiple classes of stocks, in a move to prevent domestic capital from fleeing the country's bear market to Xiaomi and other offshore-listed darlings of global finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign companies, stapled securities and stocks with so-called weighted voting rights (WVRs) listed in Hong Kong will be temporarily excluded from the pool of stocks that mainland Chinese investors are allowed to trade in, under the so-called Stock Connect programmes, according to a statement on the Shanghai exchange.[http://www.sse.com.cn/aboutus/mediacenter/hotandd/c/c_20180714_4595614.shtml]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many [Chinese] investors have said that still lack a proper understanding of these new equity products, especially with regards to the operational and financial systems of overseas companies,” the two bourses said in their joint statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why China's plan to launch the highly touted CDR scheme is still on hold[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2155107/why-chinas-plan-launch-highly-touted-cdr-scheme-still-hold]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement, coming a week after Xiaomi became the first company with multiple classes of stock to trade in Hong Kong under new listing rules, would deny investors in mainland China - where Xiaomi earns most of its sales - the chance to partake in the earnings of the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese regulators have good reason for concerned, as Shanghai's benchmark Composite Index has slumped 23 per cent since January amid the steady drumbeat of the trade war between the US and China. The Shenzhen Composite Index has fallen 22 per cent over the same period, landing Asia's largest combined equity market in bear territory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Considering that the trade war is expected to further escalate, the sluggish performance of the A-shares will drag on for a while,” said Shen Meng, executive director with investment bank Chanson &amp; Co. in Beijing. “China wants to prevent more domestic currency from flowing from the stock exchanges at home to overseas markets, including Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect programme, which started in 2014 by letting overseas investors trade stocks on the Shanghai exchange, was followed two years later by a similar programme for Shenzhen-listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/14/33044b3c-8743-11e8-99b0-7de4d17a9c3a_image_hires_212458.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our key interest is to ensure that the market remains fully informed of any material developments in relation to Stock Connect and that trading is orderly,” said the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission's Chairman Carlson Tong, in response to a query by the South China Morning Post. “We will monitor the market closely and work with the mainland regulator to develop essential regulatory structures to enable both markets to expand and broaden their connectivity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's shares began trading[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2154346/xiaomi-shares-fall-hong-kong-trading-debut-us-china-trade-war] on July 9 in Hong Kong, after an initial public offering that was trimmed by nearly half because of the unfolding trade war between the world's two largest economies. The smartphone maker had also pushed back against the overtures by the Chinese securities regulator to sell depositary receipts (CDRs), which would allow domestic Chinese investors access to overseas stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This decision will be likely to affect the liquidity of H-shares, reducing the number of firms Chinese investors could put money in,” said Chanson's Shen. “The most profound implication could be to cast a shadow over the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect schemes, which used to brag about their interconnection of investors in the two places.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was first started, more capital flowed to the Chinese exchange than the southbound funds, a situation that was only reversed in 2015 when more mainland investors sought to park their investments offshore to escape a deteriorating currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since their implementation, as much as 11.67 trillion yuan (US$1.74 trillion) of transactions had been recorded, according to the Shanghai bourse statement. A combined 779 stocks are now tradeable by investors on both sides, an increase of 14 oer cent over four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the first dual-class stock[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2136802/should-dual-class-shareholding-firms-be-allowed-hang-seng] to be listed in Hong Kong, Xiaomi turned around from its sputtering debut into four consecutive days of gains, becoming one of the most valuable stocks on the stock exchange. The stock was added to the widely tracked FTSE China A50 Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> said in April that daily southbound and northbound quotas for each of the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong connects will be quadrupled starting from May 1. They will rise to 42 billion yuan from 10.5 billion, and 52 billion yuan from 13 billion, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move was among a slew of measures to open up of China's financial sector to foreign investment, unveiled by Yi Gang, the newly appointed governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Set up by </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group in 2011, Shanghai-based Lufax - its full name is Shanghai Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange - plans to file an application with the Hong Kong exchange at the end of this month and is looking for a valuation of around US$60 billion, according to sources close to the company. That's a threefold increase from US$18.5 billion after its last funding round in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At US$60 billion, Lufax is set to become China's second-most valuable fintech company, only after Alibaba's affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> was valued at US$75 billion by CLSA in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Lufax's bankers and advisers are still discussing how many shares to sell, initial expectations are for around 10 to 15 per cent of its valuation, one of the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would make it Hong Kong's first major fintech listing since ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance raised US$1.5 billion in its Hong Kong debut back in September, which valued the insurtech firm at US$13 billion - considered back then by many in the market as a huge fish to land.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn's co-founders include Alibaba's Jack Ma Yun, Tencent's Pony Ma Huateng, and Ping An's Peter Ma Mingzhe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's biggest fintech IPO is coming in April: sources [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2128033/chinese-online-lender-lufax-plans-hong-kong-ipo-april-us60]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Officials at Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (HKEX) have made no secret of the fact that they see technology companies of all sizes as their main target for new listings this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so with the mouth-watering amounts expected to be raised by the likes of Xiaomi, Tencent Music and Baidu's video streaming site </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> through IPO later in the year, HKEX is expected to be pulling out all the stops to attract them to Hong Kong - most likely putting it head-to-head with New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Lufax listing in April comes just months after Hong Kong lost its much-coveted crown to New York for the first time in three years, as the world's biggest fundraising hub, and it even slipped behind Shanghai for the first time ever.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's IPO value for 2017 dropped to the lowest since 2012 to US$16.3 billion, compared with US$49.5 billion in the US and US$31.7 billion in China, according to data from Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Lufax is based in Shanghai's Lujiazui financial district, but still chose to list in Hong Kong has made the win all the sweeter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax has two main lines of business: wealth management focusing on “the middle class and affluent” clients, and also lending for “the mass market”, according to a document obtained by the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its middle-class investors are defined as those with assets under managements (AUM) of between US$4,500 and US$150,000, while its affluent clients are those with more than US$150,000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around two-thirds of Lufax's total AUM are from investors with more than US$75,000, the document shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has 33 million registered users and manages assets worth nearly 500 billion yuan (US$77.3 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">, Citi, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> are acting as co-sponsors on the deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax says it has built its own “risk management models” to mitigate risk. The models were developed using more than 12 years of data on consumers' credit, spending and other online behaviour, the document shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has also applied new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data, to control risk and improve customer experience, the document claims.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, the firm uses facial recognition, voice registration, and remote video interviews to authenticate identities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax has promoted itself as a “first mover in providing financial solutions for institutions and governments”, hoping to become the leader in China's budding “WealthTech” sector, and the largest non-bank consumer lender, according to the document.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the privately owned Chinese smartphone maker, has been in talks with investment banks for a possible IPO as soon as this year, with some banks saying that a US$100 billion IPO would be reasonable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That compares with a valuation of US$46 billion at its most recent funding round in 2014, and media reports suggest Hong Kong and New York are fighting it out to host the listing, which would be a massive win for either.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A float of that size would be the third-largest technology IPO in history, surpassing Snap's US$24 billion listing last March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> rank first and second with valuations of US$167 billion and US$104 billion, respectively, when they were listed in 2014 and 2012 in New York. Alibaba raised US$25 billion, but there was some bitterness at the time that it had not chosen Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, has also invited investment banks to handle its planned listing in 2018, which could value the unit at US$10 billion, Bloomberg reported recently, citing unnamed sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other potential fintech IPOs of 2018 could include Lufax's rival Dianrong.com, backed by Singapore's GIC, which is considering a Hong Kong listing to raise at least US$500 million, as well as Hong Kong's online finance lending platform WeLab, with a possible listing size of US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu's </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is aiming for a 2018 IPO in New York, valued at up to US$10 billion, according to reports.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's2017 fundraising by technology and internet companies was encouraging, with five of its 10 largest IPOs by companies operating in the new economy, compared with none in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's Shanghai and not New York that Hong Kong has to worry about in the 2018 IPO stakes [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2125873/hong-kong-falling-behind-ny-ipo-rankings-are-investors-ready]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listings by banks and securities companies - staples of Hong Kong's capital market - halved to 30 per cent of 2017's top IPOs, from 60 per cent the previous year, in line with regulators' goals to draw more new economy companies to float here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said in December it would propose rule changes to allow dual-class shares on the main board, with a formal public consultation to be launched as early as the first quarter of 2018. The overhaul in listing regulations has been described as the city's most drastic in three decades.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong medical services company </span><span class="s3">C-Mer Eye Care Holdings</span><span class="s1"> opened 82 per cent higher on its trading debut on Monday, pointing to the possibility of a positive environment for initial public offerings that may be planned for the city this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in the company, which operates eye clinics, opened at HK$5.35, above its IPO price of HK$2.90 and the marketed range of HK$2.35 to HK$2.90. It was trading at HK$5.16 by mid-morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">C-Mer, which counts Tencent Holdings chairman Pony Ma as a cornerstone investor, is raising a net HK$521.3 million (US$66.6 million). The retail share offer was increased to 98.5 million shares from 19.7 million under the exchange's clawback rule, which allows shares to be reallocated to retail investors if demand exceeds the original allocation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO was oversubscribed by more than 1,500 times, locking up about HK$89.9 billion of funds. The proceeds will go to establishing three new eye hospitals in China as well to the possible acquisition of existing eye hospitals in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The surge in C-Mer's stock came as Hong Kong's benchmark stock index rose above its historical closing record price of 31,638.23 set on October 30, 2007, though it was still shy of the intraday record high of 31,958.41 set on the same day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said optimism in Hong Kong's markets was rising after the founder of the world's largest e-commerce shopping platform, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, said he would consider listing its shares on the local bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That comment followed the announcement of a plan to change Hong Kong's listing rules to attract more companies, particularly those with dual-class share structures. The exchange's previous rule to bar companies with such structures was the reason Alibaba had originally rejected Hong Kong for its listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes are likely to kick in by mid 2018, attracting more well-known Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">OCBC Bank</span><span class="s1"> said in a research note. This new wave of IPOs is likely to suck in more funds and push up Hong Kong dollar interest rates this year, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other recent new listings in Hong Kong did not fare so well on Monday. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, an online car-loan provider backed by Tencent, fell 0.9 per cent to HK$6.75, and has been trading below its IPO price since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Computer game accessories maker </span><span class="s3">Razer Inc</span><span class="s1"> fell 0.8 per cent to HK$3.88, similar to its IPO price in November.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Who will bell the cat' perhaps sums up the current predicament in Hong Kong capital market circles. In this case the cat in question is approval of new listings and the much asked question is whether it should be the HKEX, or the SFC, or both?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Though heated discussions on the subject have been going on for several years, with the latest round of discussions happening last week, there are still no clear guidelines on how the exact modalities are going to be worked out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That said, there did seem a ray of hope last week when the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> decided to usher in listing reforms over the next three months with some drastic proposals like reducing the HKEX's powers in listing matters and making the SFC fully involved in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Adoption of these proposals could see HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia losing his place on the committee that approves new listings, while two newly formed committees with equal representation from the SFC and HKEX would handle the listing policy and complicated new listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest proposals, which sound good on paper, has, however, not met with the expected response from market circles, with some experts commenting that the reforms are not enough.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The latest proposals are not that convincing. The HKEX has been a listed company since 2000 and its main objective is to make profits. It should have nothing to do with regulation and instead transfer the powers to SFC,” said Sin Chung Kai, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, which has been urging for the removal of HKEX from regulatory matters as it sees it as conflict of interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing reforms inadequate, say miners[https://www.scmp.com/article/704018/listing-reforms-inadequate-say-miners]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Experts like Sin argue that since the HKEX already collects listing fees, it would be profitable for it to sanction more new listings than was necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Graham, chief regulatory officer of HKEX, however, refutes such charges. He said that the objective of the latest reform, including the removal of HKEX chief from the listing approval panel, is to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kennth Leung, a lawmaker for the accountancy sector, said that the current proposal does not address the conflict of interest issue fully as it still permits the HKEX listing department to conduct the initial approval. In addition, the two new panels also include HKEX members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The current proposals give HKEX a lot of influence on approval of new listings and in framing listing policies. The new structure is complicated and a duplication of efforts. It is better to allow the SFC to work with some other market participants to rule on listing issues,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Albert Au, a non-executive director of the SFC and chairman of accounting firm BDO, however, said the current reform is more than enough.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, SFC propose overhaul of stock market listing regime[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1976987/hkex-sfc-propose-overhaul-stock-market-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new proposal allows the SFC to be more involved in new listing approvals and formulation of policies. It is better than the current model, wherein the HKEX may suggest something and the same gets rejected by the SFC,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, the SFC rejected HKEX's draft proposals on dual class structure reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If the SFC and the HKEX are involved in policy formulation from an early stage, then there is no need for the former to exercise its veto power. I believe it would help in creating a better working relationship,” Au said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the three tier regulatory structure, the government's role was to set the policy while the SFC was to supervise the HKEX as a frontline regulator. Some markets such as Britain, however, have an independent body to approve new listings to prevent conflict of interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Can the proposed listing reform improve the quality of the market?[https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1978086/can-proposed-listing-reform-improve-quality-market]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government had after an expert group report in 2003 decided to shift all regulatory powers to the SFC. But it made an immediate about-turn a month later and dropped the plan due to stiff opposition from the HKEX and the business sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lina Lee, head of Asia at Ashurst, a law firm, feels that it would be better to let the HKEX continue as a frontline regulator. “It is better not to opt for drastic changes of the current system as it has worked well in the past,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The removal of the HKEX chief executive from the listing committee is, however, a right step to remove concerns about the conflict of interest issue,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Similar sentiments are also shared Sally Wong, the chief executive of Hong Kong Investment Funds Association. She said it the reforms are helpful as it enhances the governance structure and gives greater clarity and certainty to the respective roles and responsibilities of the participants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is an important step in addressing a perennial concern about the inherent conflict on the role of the HKEX,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for brokers, also agrees with the current proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We should not allow the SFC to be the sole regulator for listed companies as it may make the SFC more powerful. It would be better to allow the HKEX and other market participants to also monitor listed companies. This would certainly bring more checks and balances,” Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock exchange chief Charles Li Xiaojia says the city must be ready to reform its share-listing rules if it wants to stay a globally competitive financial centre, but it was right to stick to principles that saw it lose out yesterday to New York for the potential HK$100 billion listing of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li spoke to the South China Morning Post hours after mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba said it had picked New York after months of wrangling with Hong Kong regulators over its management structure that the Securities and Futures Commission said breached its "one shareholder, one vote" governance rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Everything has a cost. Our persistence has a cost too," Li told the Post, but added that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> would continue with the review of its existing listing rules - which began after a stalemate with Alibaba last autumn - even though the deal was now dead. We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant Charles Li Xiaojia</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The reform review in the HKEx will not stop because Alibaba has decided to list elsewhere," Li said. "We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant, but Alibaba's proposal has propelled the management to review our operating model. The eventual loss may be even larger if we don't undergo reforms [of the] listing regime."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the stock exchange chief was careful to back regulation that many international investors - and the SFC - say define Hong Kong as a respected market in which to trade and invest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We feel proud of Hong Kong as we ensure that our rule of law and investor protection remain intact," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou -based Alibaba, led by former English teacher Jack Ma Yun, said yesterday that it would begin the process for an initial public offering in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's regulators had rejected Alibaba's wish for an amendment to the city's listing rules to accommodate a partnership structure that gives Ma and other senior managers the right to nominate a majority of board members, despite owning only around 10 per cent of the firm's stock. Exchanges in the US allow such dual-class structures. The other major stock holders in Alibaba are </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">'s US$16 billion IPO in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The estimate is based on the firm's current expected market value of between US$100 billion and US$120 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba said on its corporate blog yesterday that the steps towards a US IPO would make the firm "more global and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment banks, including </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">, are said by market participants to be the lead managers for the Alibaba listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US listing will provide a swift means for Alibaba to lower the cost of capital since the deal-hungry internet firm has spent more than US$3 billion in a buying spree over the past year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A decade has passed since authorities first singled out the area, known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop, as a major infrastructure development project for the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, after a protracted wrangle over ownership, the Shenzhen and Hong Kong governments agreed to jointly develop the 87-hectare site[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2058878/hong-kong-and-shenzhen-set-partner-innovation-and-technology] into a hub for hi-tech firms, with a supporting ecosystem of research and development (R&amp;D), higher education and cultural facilities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Obviously, little had happened since. But just across the Shenzhen River, the picture was starkly different.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen special economic zone has in recent decades evolved from a fishing village to “factory of the world” to hi-tech hub - and it now holds 12 million people and three million businesses, including Chinese technology names known to the world including internet giant Tencent, drone maker DJI and infocomm bigwig </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was only about a decade ago that the mainland city switched from producing garments and electrical appliances to high-value IT and R&amp;D activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On January 16, state-run media gleefully announced that Shenzhen last year had surpassed Hong Kong's economic output to hit 2.2 trillion yuan (US$338 billion) on the back of 8.8 per cent growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/28/8553eecc-0289-11e8-b181-443655c1d2b1_image_hires_162148.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shortly before, Guangzhou, the municipal city of Guangdong province, trumpeted its economy's 7 per cent growth, which pushed gross domestic product to an unprecedented 2.15 trillion yuan in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's 2017 economic performance will be revealed next month during Financial Secretary Paul Chan's budget speech. The city was expected to announce growth of 3.7 per cent with GDP at HK$2.58 billion (US$331 billion), putting it behind Shenzhen and Guangzhou for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts said that using GDP alone to compare the cities would be inadequate, with GDP per capita - output divided by population - a better indication of standard of living.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/28/86c2f974-0289-11e8-b181-443655c1d2b1_image_hires_162148.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Using this measure, Hong Kong, at US$44,000, was doing better than Shenzhen (US$25,000) and Guangzhou (US$21,000), Ayesha Macpherson Lau, managing partner of professional services firm </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">'s Hong Kong office, pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has the highest standard of living and is still way ahead,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But lawmakers and entrepreneurs looking to the future said that with neighbouring cities catching up, Hong Kong needed to hustle to maintain its standing as a competitive and vibrant economy. So what could it do to achieve this and even leapfrog the competition?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Building the right ecosystem</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen's manic pace of growth in the last decade was fuelled by an abundance of labour and capital invested in R&amp;D and innovation. In contrast, Hong Kong spent the same period grappling with a tourism downturn, political upheaval and skyrocketing property prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It also stubbornly remained reliant on its traditional pillar industries - retail, property, financial services and shipping - and fell behind its neighbours such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore when it came to investing in R&amp;D, fostering innovation and nurturing home-grown talent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/28/8672fa50-0289-11e8-b181-443655c1d2b1_image_hires_162148.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam]'s announcement last year that the city would double its R&amp;D expenditure to 1.5 per cent of GDP or about HK$45 billion in five years thus came as welcome news. Lam also said that the government would offer private firms more generous tax deductions if they invested in R&amp;D.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Innovation and Technology Bureau told the Post that since November 2015, the government had injected HK$18 billion to promote innovation and technology development, and had earmarked another HK$10 billion for the purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our efforts … are beginning to see results,” a spokesperson said, adding that its expenditure on R&amp;D in 2016 was HK$19.7 billion and had gone up 8 per cent from the year before even though GDP growth in the same period averaged 4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IT sector lawmaker Charles Mok acknowledged that it might be unfair to compare the growth of Shenzhen's tech sector with that of Hong Kong's, given that the former had “factories in Guangdong and the rest of China to back it up, and it has lots of land and a strong background in manufacturing and electronics”, while the latter had always positioned itself as a finance hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the government still had a duty to attract the right kind of tech companies here, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government should invite market leaders from the mainland and abroad to do research and development here. Taiwan and Singapore went out of their way to attract </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and Apple … [so] in this sense Hong Kong has lost to them already,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mok had previously been vocal about the government allowing more sharing-economy businesses to set up shop, instead of citing consumer protection and restricting ride hailing service Uber[http://www.scmp.com/topics/uber] and room rental firm </span><span class="s3">Airbnb</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, the city's financial services regulator launched a “sandbox” for fintech entities to test their offerings on a pilot basis without adhering to the usual supervisory requirements. Mok suggested the government do the same for sharing-economy technology, to encourage firms to pursue innovative and better business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At least one entrepreneur who spoke to the Post said the city could still do more to help start-ups grow their business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zack, a 28-year-old mainlander who spoke on condition that his full name not be used, said he had high hopes of starting his electrical lab tool business in Hong Kong three years ago - until it became too expensive to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He only got a year's rental waiver at the city's technology incubator, Hong Kong Science Park in Sha Tin, and as he struggled to find investors, he found the salaries he was expected to pay employees were too high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zack took matters into his own hands and moved to Dongguan, another manufacturing hub in the Pearl River Delta.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There, he and a team of three other youngsters shared a home office costing 3,000 yuan a month (US$468 or HK$3,667). Each of them spent about 2,500 yuan per month on living costs - which he doubted would be possible if he had remained in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are many policies to support talented and young entrepreneurs who wish to work or start businesses in Shenzhen,” he said. “Other than subsidies, the Shenzhen municipal government supports more than 100 companies with its own investment fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Can Hong Kong offer the same thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese University business school lecturer Simon Lee Siu-por, who regularly taught at the school's Shenzhen campus, said the mainland city offered an ecosystem that allowed research and entrepreneurship to thrive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are not just talking about research centres, but also offices, residential buildings, hi-tech production factories, and other supporting facilities,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said he had a “revolutionary” suggestion for the government - why not rent a parcel of land on the mainland and provide a similar environment?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In Hong Kong, it's so difficult to get land approval from the Legislative Council,” Lee said, adding that the lease idea could be a more practical option.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An optimal talent mix</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chris Wen Weiqiang, a 31-year-old research manager at the Hong Kong office of a multinational company described the city as “a great place for professionals”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wen, who completed his postgraduate studies in Guangzhou, said: “All systems, from public utilities to private services, are so well developed and clear-cut and its high wages and low taxes help me earn more and save more.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/28/8601a5e4-0289-11e8-b181-443655c1d2b1_image_hires_162148.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, Hong Kong's cosmopolitan nature had always attracted international talent but Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung, a pro-establishment lawmaker and a member of Carrie Lam's Cabinet, said the city still needed more skilled workers. Addressing the skills mismatch in education and easing immigration restrictions to attract skilled talent to the hi-tech and research industries would help.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Educators said young Hongkongers should have better science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, and also hone skills such as the ability to solve complex issues and innovate solutions, which would be necessary for the future economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Academy of Sciences of Hong Kong, which recognises the contributions of local scientists, found in a study last year that almost half of new senior secondary students did not take any science or technology subjects while enrolment in advanced mathematics classes dropped from 23 per cent in 2012 to 14 per cent in 2016, much lower than that of Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A report by the Economist Intelligence Unit last year found that to “future-proof” students, countries needed a curriculum focused on skills that would be in demand, ways of testing those skills, and well-supported teachers who were equipped to teach them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu Huawei, principal of Shenzhen Middle School - the best performing secondary school in the municipality - said it was hiring more educated teachers and designing more special curriculums to make it a “world class middle school.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I am the fourth teacher with a doctoral degree in this school and there are too few of us here,” he said. “We need to have dozens of, even up to 100 PhD graduates from famous universities home and abroad to realise our goal,” he proclaimed, adding that the school had joined forces with Tencent, </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> and DJI to set up 10 innovation experience centres to expose students to IT.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What Zhu said next could also be instructive for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Basic education is part of a city's core competency. The more high-quality primary and secondary schools Shenzhen has, the more attractive is the city to talents [as their children can get a good education],” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“All these will be important for Shenzhen to become a modern, internationalised and innovative city.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese University of Hong Kong economics professor Terence Chong Tai-leung urged the government to also look at how to boost local labour force participation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is already a very mature and efficient economy. If it wants to have higher economic growth, it must increase inputs, which are capital, labour and efficiency,” Chong said, adding that as an international financial centre, capital was not a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One way would be to improve childcare facilities and urge women who had left the workforce to return. The city's labour participation rate was 55 per cent for females and 68 per cent for males as of December last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Boosting core strengths</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it was crucial to pursue new areas of growth, </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">'s Lau suggested that the city also ensured that it retained its pole position as a place to raise capital from international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong's global financial position means the city can be the platform for diversified funding sources such as syndicated loans, private equity funds, bank financing, green bonds and listing on the stock market,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On that note, the Hong Kong stock exchange had proposed allowing dual-class shares to attract new economy companies to list in the city. Multiple-class shareholding structures were more attractive to technology companies as they gave them more control of the board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau and other analysts stressed that the city should also continue to preserve its strengths as the world's freest economy, with top-notch professional and financial services talent, strong rule of law and developed transport and logistics links to the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These qualities would make the city a natural draw for international players seeking to participate in China's landmark projects, including its Belt and Road[http://www.scmp.com/topics/belt-and-road-initiative] international trade strategy and “Greater Bay Area”[http://www.scmp.com/topics/greater-bay-area] plan, which aims to unite Hong Kong, Macau and nine mainland cities into China's answer to Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Miles Wen Haofu, the 28-year-old founder of Fano Lab, which provided companies with artificial intelligence solutions for customer service, agreed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An electrical and electronic engineering PhD graduate from the University of Hong Kong, Wen turned down offers from Silicon Valley firms to start his business, which just last month received funding from property tycoon Li Ka-shing's investment arm, Horizons Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wen said what he valued most was the city's clear commercial and intellectual property laws, which ensured the contracts he signed stood on firm ground.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a small market but it's a good place for us to sell our software to clients around the world,” Wen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“International clients prefer our products to those produced by mainland-based companies because Hong Kong has a better reputation in the global business community.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) reported a 49 per cent rise in profit for the first quarter, thanks to higher turnover and more new listings, sending its shares up as much as 2 per cent on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, which has just completed its largest listing reforms in three decades in a bid to attract more companies, posted net profit of HK$2.56 billion (US$326.12 million) for the first quarter, up from HK$1.72 billion in the same period a year ago and a record for a single quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results beat expectations of a net profit of HK$2.31 billion in a poll of analysts by </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">. Earnings per share is HK$2.07.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has revamped its listing rules to try and make itself more attractive as a listing destination, particularly for big technology firms, which will now be allowed to list if they have dual-class share structures. However some analysts cautioned that the outlook for the bourse may not be so rosy in the current three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Turnover and new listings were high in the first quarter,” saidChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services industry, who is also a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the outlook for the second quarter may not be so optimistic. Turnover has gone down recently as markets globally are volatile, while the number of applications under the new listing regime is slower than expected. These factors would affect the result of the HKEX in the second quarter,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">'s new listing rules draw just two applications, far fewer than expected[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145145/hong-kongs-new-listing-rules-draw-just-tickle-applications-far]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX shares rose as much as 2 per cent in the afternoon session after the release of its earnings, before closing at HK$257, up 0.31 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First-quarter profit was the highest for a single quarter at HKEX since its establishment in 2000, and was lifted by a 96 per cent rise in trading fee income to HK$676 million from improved turnover. Average daily turnover stood at HK$146 billion during the first three months this year, up 97 per cent from HK$74.3 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 10 per cent in January to reach a record high of 33,484 points on January 29, before falling back in the following two months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fees meanwhile rose by a total of HK$28 million, with a HK$16 million increase inannual listing fees from a higher number of listed companies and a HK$12 million increasein initial listing fees due to more IPOs. There were 69 new listings on the main board and the GEM second board for growth firms in the first quarter, up from 40 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">a&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A jump in revenue from the two Stock Connect schemes that link the Hong Kong bourse with its Shanghai and Shenzhen counterparts to facilitate two-way trading also helped the HKEX in the first quarter. The schemes brought in combined revenue at HK$172 million, more than double the HK$75 million in the same period last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of Switzerland-based financial technology company Avaloq will focus on expanding business in China and Asia as well as preparing for a possible stock exchange listing, after handing over his chief executive duties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francisco Fernandez, who also founded the company which provides cloud-based solutions for more than 150 banks worldwide, said in a telephone interview from Zurich that he sees a lot of potential in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The change will allow me to have more time to focus on expansion plans and the future development strategy, such as how to expand further in mainland China and Hong Kong,” Fernandez said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is a big market with a fast-growing segment of wealthy bank clients. It has a lot of good financial and innovative companies. They would be interested in </span><span class="s3">Avaloq</span><span class="s1">'s services,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's clients already include </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1">, DBS, China Citic Bank International and Agricultural Bank of China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fernandez's streamlined role will also allow him more time to prepare plans for a possible stock market listing in the next three to five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As </span><span class="s3">Avaloq</span><span class="s1"> is about to enter the next phase in accelerating its growth - both organically and through potential acquisitions - the company is implementing a new governance structure that strengthens both its operational and strategic management,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is open about where to list, but he said Hong Kong may be a potential destination, and he would be monitoring plans to reform listing rules in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the stock market operator, recently announced a major listing reform to allow dual-class shareholding structure companies to list from the second half of this year, lifting a ban on such structures that has been in place since the 1980s.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change came after Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's largest IPO market in 2017, sliding to third place, with New York, which allows listings of firms with multiple classes of shares, including stocks with special voting rights for founders, taking the top spot.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any change to rules governing Hong Kong's financial system must enshrine appropriate checks and balances that safeguard the interests of all market participants, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For a new structure to come about, you have to first convince the market to believe in it. If a consultation on listing reform takes place, it needs to provide very specific recommendations to protect the interests of company management, big shareholders and small shareholders," he said at a year-end briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan's tentative support for the creation of a listing reform consultation committee appears to be a shift from his statements two months ago, when he said Hong Kong's rules on initial public offerings (IPOs) work fine and the stock exchange had no plans to consult the market on reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Potential reform of the city's listing rules became an issue in October after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> failed to convince Hong Kong regulators to allow it to list with a so-called partnership structure that gives a coterie of top executives the power to nominate most of the firm's board members. Every place has its … legal structures. Hong Kong cannot [be overhauled] overnight CHAN KA-KEUNG</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The collapse of talks to secure the potential US$15 billion share sale, which may instead happen in New York, sparked handwringing among regulators who insisted they would not abandon the principle of "one shareholder, one vote" despite competition from the US where "dual-class" shares are permitted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fears are growing in some quarters that Hong Kong, which relies heavily on listings from mainland firms, could start to lose its appeal as an IPO venue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, the government's top financial advisory body, the Financial Services Development Council, began a review of the city's stock listing regime and ability to attract international IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Chan rejected allegations that Hong Kong was lagging behind and should imitate America's system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Every place has its own history and established legal structures," he said. "America's </span><span class="s3">Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> doesn't have a listing committee to review filings like the Hong Kong stock exchange does. The US may have 'looser' listing regulations, but they have developed other ways to protect shareholders, such as by allowing class action suits. Hong Kong cannot simply allow class action suits and overhaul our legal system overnight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If you want to introduce new checks and balances in order to have a modified listing system in Hong Kong, you'd have to convince the market that those checks and balances would be enough to protect everyone's interests."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan also said the outlook for China's market reforms is positive, and that mainland IPOs have been eager to "test the waters" in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 10-month IPO frenzy in Hong Kong that has seen a string of tech companies' shares massively oversubscribed by eager investors appears to have fizzled out - that's if the lukewarm response to Xiaomi's offering is anything to go by.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese smartphone maker has so far received about HK$8.5 billion in orders from individual investors via major local brokers, exceeding allocations by about 2.5 times, based on unofficial figures which have yet to be finalised from 14 of the city's largest brokerage firms. . That figure - the amount loaned to investors to fund their share purchases - had in fact fallen from about HK$10 billion earlier as some investors withdrew their orders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's shares are scheduled to make their trading debut on July 9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock sale, which aims to raise up to US$6.1 billion, ends at the end of Thursday and brokers predict the retail portion will be oversubscribed by five to 10 times ultimately, with the amount of lock-in capital expected to be around HK$24 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would make it the worst response from retail investors since ZhongAn Online, China's largest online insurer, kicked off the bonanza of enthusiastically received IPOs of “new economy” companies in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the money loaned by brokers to their clients to buy into an IPO makes up a significant proportion of the total take-up of shares, making it a good gauge of interest from retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The poor take-up by individual investors comes despite the endorsement of three of China's richest tycoons - Li Ka-shing, Jack Ma Yun and Pony Ma Huateng have all invested in the IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ZhongAn and the four biggest tech listings since then - e-publisher China Literature, online car retailer </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, gaming hardware maker Razer and Ping An Good Doctor - have all attracted enormous oversubscriptions and locked in huge amounts of capital. Online health care platform Ping An Good Doctor's IPO was oversubscribed by more than 650 times, while China Literature's stock sale locked in HK$521 billion of capital, the second most in Hong Kong history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yixin's IPO in November was 560 times oversubscribed and attracted lock-in capital of HK$382 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/06/28/356af0a2-7aa4-11e8-8ce4-b59b2fedb43f_image_hires_163117.jpg]For Xiaomi, the problem could be one of timing, according to some analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi's IPO has an unfortunate listing window, sort of becoming a victim of the escalating US-China trade tensions, which has sunk Hong Kong stocks into a technical bear market,” said Alex Wong Kwok-ying, director of asset management at Ample Capital. “Investors fear to tread [the market] at the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, entered bear territory on Tuesday, joining mainland China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which has also sunk 20 per cent from its peak earlier in the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This could affect investors' appetite for major IPOs in the pipeline, such as China Tower, the world's biggest operator of mobile phone towers, which hopes to raise as much as US$10 billion, and online-service booking app </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">, which has already filed a listing application to the Hong Kong stock exchange and is expected to float in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another factor weighing on Xiaomi's IPO is its pricing, which raised eyebrows by valuing the company at between 39 and 51 times earnings. That compares with the 14.8 times forward earnings at Apple, the world's most profitable smartphone and devices maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong investors still have the ‘old economy' mindset of using P/E ratios to value tech companies,” Wong said. “It could take years to build a ‘new economy' culture. ”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rising US interest rates have sparked a wave of capital outflows from emerging markets, and sent funding costs in Hong Kong soaring. The cost of money measured by the one-month interbank offer rate, known as hibor, recently rose to a 10-year high of 2.125 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's IPO fails to dazzle even if Hong Kong tycoons are believers[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2152400/hong-kong-retail-investors-give-xiaomis-ipo-cold-shoulder-put]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the current IPO margin financing rates of 2.88 to 3 per cent, Xiaomi's shares need to rise by 10 per cent to 20 per cent on their debut for investors just to cover their costs, said Alvin Cheung, associate director at Prudential Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors are also hesitant to increase their bets after seeing many so-called new economy IPOs quickly falling below their offer prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The halo effect, or mythology, of ‘new economy IPO' is on the wane,” said Cheung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investors have learned their lessons that it is not necessarily a guarantee of making money.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The shares of four of the five biggest tech IPOs since September are trading below their offering prices. Two of them, </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> and Razer, have fallen about 50 per cent from their peaks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi says it can grow tenfold to justify US$6.1 billion IPO[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2152146/worlds-no-4-smartphone-maker-says-it-can-grow-tenfold-warrant]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past few months, the shares of about half of 87 IPOs have slipped below their offer prices within the first month of trading, according to Bloomberg data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lacklustre outcome for Xiaomi may cast a pall over Hong Kong's stock exchange, which last year pushed through the biggest overhaul of its listing regulations in decades in a bid to attract biotechnology research teams and big technology companies like Xiaomi to raise capital in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi will become the first company to list in Hong Kong with a dual-class shareholding structure, which gives its founding shareholders greater voting power even though they have minority stakes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> would cut the number of partners the firm has and bind them to a three-year share sale ban if Hong Kong regulators accept a controversial management structure that is blocking its potential HK$100 billion initial public offering, a source close to the listing authorities told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal had been floated to the stock exchange's listing committee ahead of a regular meeting tomorrow, but no formal listing application had yet been submitted, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is aimed at showing that Alibaba is willing to make concessions," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source close to the Securities and Futures Commission said such a concession was unlikely to be enough to persuade the authorities to accept the Alibaba structure. "Alibaba will still not give up its demand to nominate the majority of board directors, which still gives more power to certain shareholders than others. That is unacceptable to the SFC," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Share lock-ups for executives are not uncommon in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had no comment, but a source close to the company said talks were continuing and constructive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The e-commerce giant's planned listing is in limbo over its management's determination to maintain a partnership structure that regulators worry gives top executives more rights than ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources close to Alibaba insist the firm does not want a dual share structure or a change to rules. Instead, it is seeking an exemption under an existing rule that is part of the Hong Kong listing code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun revealed fresh details about the partnership scheme earlier this month that analysts saw as being designed to soothe concerns. The scheme started in 2010 and had elected 28 partners over a three-round selection process following strict eligibility criteria.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and his top executives own about 10 per cent of the company, compared with about 24 per cent owned by United States internet firm </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and about 37 per cent by Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment bankers who have met Ma have told him that a New York listing would be his best bet for securing the control he craves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival, Nasdaq, are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial experts say, however, that Alibaba has missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and it may have only until the end of this month before the same happens in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any later and the application would be subject to new rules that come into effect on October 1, obliging firms to allow at least two months between the date of a sponsor's formal appointment and a listing application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said after the first anniversary ceremony of its joint venture with the two mainland stock exchanges yesterday that the city's listing rules were working well and there was no reason to change them to accommodate dual share structures, in the latest sign that the regulatory stand-off remains unresolved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked about the status of the potential listing of Alibaba, Li reiterated that Hong Kong's listing regime was designed to protect all shareholders equally, underscoring the reservations that the regulators have about the company's structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laura Cha Shih May-lung, the newly elected chairwoman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, has identified the next three-year strategic plan as well as chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia's contract renewal as top priorities during her first 100 days in office.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As expected by the market, the board of directors at HKEX elected Cha, the Financial Services Development Council chairwoman, as the bourse operator's new chairwoman on Thursday morning. She succeeds Chow Chung-kong, who stepped down on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“My first priority in the first 100 days in office, or in the next few years, would be working on the new three-year strategic plan for HKEX, from 2019 to 2021.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX announced its largest listing reform in 25 years on Tuesday; it will allow dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotechnology companies with no revenue to apply for listing in Hong Kong from Monday. The bourse faces keen competition from Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Facing competition from overseas exchanges would be a major challenge for me. However, I believe the listings reform just announced has achieved a good balance between market development and investor protection and, hence, will help the HKEX to compete,” said Cha.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said another priority would be HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia's contract, which will expire in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The board will work on the matter of the contract renewal issue with Charles,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li, a former investment banker at JPMorgan, joined the HKEX nine years ago after a job interview led by Cha, who was a director at the exchange at the time.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I am honoured to be the first woman to become HKEX chairman. The Hong Kong stock market does not have good female representation.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, 68, trained as a lawyer and was the vice-chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission in the 1990s, before heading north to become the vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission from 2001 to 2004.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Alibaba, China's e-commerce giant, made its monumental debut with a 38 per cent jump in value on its first day of trading on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on Friday, it is hard not to be awed by the enormous wealth its chairman, Jack Ma Yun, has created for himself, his employees and investors - the focus of intensive media frenzy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded by the former English teacher in his Hangzhou flat 15 years ago, the company raised US$21.8 billion in one of the largest initial public offerings the world has seen, valuing the company at US$231 billion, surpassing </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and Amazon and becoming the world's second largest internet company after </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on Friday's closing price of US$93.89, Ma's remaining stake of 7.8 per cent was worth more than US$18 billion, easily making him the mainland's richest man and among the wealthiest in Asia. As fireworks went off at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou to celebrate the listing, it has also made many of its young employees US dollar millionaires.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But wealth creation is only one of many far-reaching implications of the Alibaba IPO as foreign investors bet on the company as the latest vehicle to tap China's explosive growth of e-commerce and internet use despite the concerns over the firm's management structure and government interference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing has firmly placed Alibaba, which until now was not well known outside China, on the global stage for future expansion in overseas markets, even though Ma said the company would continue to focus on the market at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, it also reflects the rise of a new wave of technology giants to propel the Chinese economy forward as the government seeks greater reliance on innovation and domestic consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the latest e-commerce giant to gain attention abroad following the rise of Lenovo, the world's largest maker of personal computers; Baidu, China's largest search engine company; </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest maker of networking equipment; and Tencent, owner of the popular </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> messaging service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another important feature one can't fail to notice is that all these tech giants are privately owned in an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises with monopolies or cartels in banking, energy, telecoms and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Entrepreneurs like Alibaba's Ma, Tencent's Pony Ma and Robin Li of Baidu reflect the fact that the private sector is not only a jobs creator, but contributes more than 60 per cent to China's overall economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's trading platforms have helped create millions of jobs on the mainland as self-employed entrepreneurs set up online shops to tap a user base of several hundred million people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, Alibaba's blockbuster success is set to trigger deep soul-searching for mainland regulators and investors alike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most Chinese tech giants have sought their primary listings in New York, except Tencent and Lenovo, which listed in Hong Kong. Regulatory hurdles and the low-risk appetite of investors on the mainland have driven the best tech firms away from its stock markets, depriving small investors of the chance to buy into those high-growth companies directly even though they contribute to the bulk of their profits as users and consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, Hong Kong was the preferred choice for Alibaba's IPO but it was forced to choose New York because Hong Kong does not offer dual-class share structures - a move local regulators are now reviewing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact that foreign investors are the biggest winners from Alibaba's IPO has also shown that China still has a long way to go in building up its own venture capital markets and financing its own hi-tech development and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is true that the sovereign fund </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> and several private investment firms linked to relatives of former government leaders will reap generous payouts from Alibaba's listing, but their stakes in the company are tiny compared to those of </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and Japan's </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1">, which earned much more as the firm's biggest shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> placed their faith in Ma by investing in Alibaba in its early days at a time when he was spurned by investors at home and abroad.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Securities Association will continue to press the government to cut stamp duty in a bid to boost market turnover, according to the newly elected head of the association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks on Monday reached their highest level in nearly a decade after media reports said the bourse operator was considering asking government to cut the stamp duty on share trades. HKEX and government, however, both later denied any plan to change the stamp duty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New market for dual-class shares garners momentum after watered down listing reforms[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2111438/new-market-dual-class-shares-garners-momentum-after-watered]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government is reluctant to cut the stamp duty as it is an important income source for the government," said Gary Cheung Wai-kwok, the newly elected chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association, on Thursday. "However, it [government] should note that a reduction of stamp duty will cut down the overall transaction cost. This will boost market turnover and hence the income from the stamp duty would remain high."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China cut stamp duty in 2009 by half, which led average daily turnover to rise five times in the next five years, according to Gordon Tsui Leun-on, director of the association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While many other markets no longer collect stamp duty, Hong Kong government still collects 0.1 per cent from the buyer and seller of the value of each stock transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stamp duty is the most expensive single item in stock transaction in Hong Kong, compared with broker's commission at about 0.05 per cent of the transaction value, a 0.0027 per cent levy paid to the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, and a 0.005 per cent trading fee paid to the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government's revenue from stamp duty has fluctuated with the market's turnover. Over the past 20 years, the government's revenue from stamp duty as a percentage of overall revenue has ranged from a low of 1.66 per cent to a high of 9.89 per cent, according to PwC.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung also said the association has been in talks with HKEX to introduce new platforms for bond and funds trading. He said he supports the exchange to launch a third board to attract new economy companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We would like to see more new products to be traded on HKEX," he said. "This will provide more investment choice for investors and more revenue for brokers."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local brokers, who already face keen competition from big banks and other international players, were dealt another blow with the closure of HKEX's iconic trading hall this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung said it was "a shame to see the trading hall go".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Now I do not know what could best represent the Hong Kong stock market."</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's recent fake vaccine scandal has proved to be a huge setback for </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, with retail investors showing little interest in its IPO - the first Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company to seek a dual listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the eight-year-old Beijing-based cancer drug maker has nothing to do with the scandal, brokers however said the incident has hurt investors' confidence in the sector and hence affected the retail response to its IPO, which closed at noon on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO started on Monday aimed at selling 65 million new ordinary shares priced between HK$94.4 to HK$111.6 each, allowing the company to potentially raise between US$908 million and US$1.07 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> has set the price for the offered shares at HK$108, higher than HK$103 - the midpoint of the indicative range, according to a statement on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore's sovereign fund manager GIC, Beijing and Hong Kong-based private equity investor </span><span class="s3">Hillhouse Capital Group</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong-based health care focused investment firm Ally Bridge Group, and New York-based investment firm Baker Bros Advisors are the deal's cornerstone investors, a source close to the deal said. They earlier agreed to buy close to a third of the shares on offer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of Thursday morning, five major stockbrokers active in margin financing showed their combined margin lending for investors in the IPO stood at only HK$250 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers estimate the retail tranche of the IPO may end up only just sold. Normally if the public offer is undersubscribed, bookrunners will cover it with the international placement tranche.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“First of all, the recent fake vaccine incident in China has dampened the whole industry, so it's not a good time to invest in related biotech stocks,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Secondly, the market sentiment is really bad. Tencent has finally broken through the key support level of HK$370. So overall it's more bad timing rather than the biotech sector itself,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index fell 2.3 per cent on Thursday to close at 27,683.05 during the lunch break. The benchmark index has shed 10 per cent over the last three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market's sharp fall has dampened retail investors' enthusiasm for IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, the average IPO retail subscription in Hong Kong was 29 times the total size on offer, the lowest since January 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This was down from 1,191 times in April, with the ratio falling to 301 in May and to 154 in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The timing for any IPO these days is wrong as the market mood is bad,” said Cheung Tin Sang, a veteran broker at Luk Fook Securities (HK).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far, eight biotech firms have submitted applications under reforms introduced by bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) in April. The biggest listing reform in 25 years was aimed at attracting giant technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures - shares that carry different voting rights - and biotechnology firms that are yet to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2157737/unprofitable-biotech-firm-ascletis-pharma-rises-hong-kong]BeiGene is only the second to launch an IPO under the new regime. Its shares will start trading on August 8. BeiGene listed on the Nasdaq in 2016 but was keen on a dual listing in Hong Kong to improve its exposure in Asia while being close to the mainland market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> shares closed 4.2 per cent lower on Wednesday at US$181.74.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong however believes the lukewarm response from retail investors does not mean HKEX's reforms have failed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The retail investors are more short-term market driven. The institutional side will be longer term and judge it on company fundamental values,” Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One week after the listing reform was introduced, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has received only two applications under the new rules, indicating that companies may be struggling to choose between Hong Kong and a rival China Depository Receipts (CDR) programme put forward on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi filed a Hong Kong listing application on Thursday, becoming the first to apply under the new rules which permit companies with multiple classes of shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hangzhou-based Ascletis Pharma, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat hepatitis C in China, became the first pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply when it submitted an application on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is very disappointing as the applications under the new listing rules are slower than expected,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The companies which plan to list under the HKEX's new regime may take a wait-and-see approach to examine China's CDR scheme. The valuation in Shanghai and Shenzhen is higher than in Hong Kong and they may like to take time to consider if they should list here or on the mainland. HKEX would need to do more promotion to attract these companies to list here,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia had indicated a dozen companies would likely be among the first batch to apply for a listing under the reform.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To be sure, although Xiaomi is the sole company applying as dual-class shareholding company to list in Hong Kong, it is a major application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bankers familiar with the plan said the Beijing-based company was seeking to raise US$10 billion in a sale that would value the eight-year-old company at US$100 billion. The IPO is expected to be the 15th biggest of all time, and the fourth-largest in Hong Kong's history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of HKEX, the bourse operator, were up 1.5 per cent at HK$255.80 during morning trade on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers and lawyers said there are some biotech companies that are considering a listing in Hong Kong, but have yet to complete the necessary documentation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The overall outlook is positive and there are a lot of companies who are in various stages of their Hong Kong IPO plan under the new chapters. The new rules have only been effective for a week and many companies are still in the process of preparing the listing applications,” saidPaul Lau, Partner, head of capital markets of </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect the bulk of the initial batch of listing applications under the new listing regime will come through in late May to end June. Many calendar year-end companies will try to make their submission by end of June, as otherwise the 2018 stub period financial statements will be required,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chairman and chief executive of Capital Link Investment, said the weak response was not a surprise so soon after the new rules were introduced.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Preparing an IPO and readying a date is a true process and one that is very hard to conform to a rule change. This is a positive development and will attract new tech and biotech companies but it's not surprising that it hasn't had a lot of takers thus far,” McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Xiaomi has been obviously waiting for this change and seemingly was ready. They are also one of the few that can have true confidence in this environment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">McGonegal said concerns over US and China trade tensions have also affected the IPO process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has always been a tricky balance. Bankers and companies pick the exchange, pick the size of the deal, pick the price but are always subject to the emotion and appetite of that market on that given listing day,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at Dechert, said many biotech and new economy companies have expressed interest in a Hong Kong listing but they need more time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new consultation conclusion has only been published for less than a month. I think we will see many more applications in the second half of this year. There seems to be a lot of interest from new economy companies and biotech companies,” Chan said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The head of Hong Kong's stock exchange said he is confident oil giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO candidate, will list its shares in the city even as he warned of “tough times” ahead for the market amid a simmering trade spat between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The potential trade war between the US and China would change the relationship between the two economies. It will be a tough time for the stock market,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the threat of an all-out trade war causing volatility in the stock market last week, Li said the outlook for IPOs remains strong and the city could host the what would be the world's biggest initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I am confident </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> will choose to list in Hong Kong eventually. Even if it doesn't come on day one, I am confident it will list here later,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> is expected to launch the largest IPO in history, raising up to US$100 billion in a listing that would give the state-owned energy behemoth a valuation of US$1 trillion to US$2 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it has not yet announced a listing timetable, stockbrokers believe Aramco is considering selling 5 per cent of its equity in both domestic and international markets, with Hong Kong, London and the US in a race to secure the foreign listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior officials from Hong Kong have actively courted the IPO. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and then-HKEX chairman Chow Chung Kong met Saudi Arabia's King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the ministers of energy and finance in December to promote the city as a venue for the shares debut.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam talks up Saudi Arabia as trade partner in ‘Belt and Road' push[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2122957/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-talks-saudi-arabia-trade-partner]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco sent senior executives to meet with officials from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> last year to discuss the flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Aramco may favour Hong Kong because it is close to mainland China, which is a large oil consumer. The city's location in an Asian time zone is another advantage because investors would be able to trade while the western market is closed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li is also optimistic that many unicorns - start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion - will list their dual-class shares here after Xiaomi becomes the first to do so through its huge IPO next week. It follows a major shake-up of listing rules in April which allowed big tech companies with multiple classes of shareholder to list for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where do blockbuster IPOs stand as the fizz goes out of Hong Kong's stock trading debuts?[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2148830/where-do-blockbuster-ipos-stand-fizz-goes-out-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi hopes to raise up to US$6.1 billion in Hong Kong in the biggest IPO globally for two years. However, the smartphone maker this week abruptly decided to drop plans to tap mainland investors via China depository receipts (CDRs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not know the reason but I guess the company may consider it would be too risky and too complicated to list in Hong Kong and the mainland via CDR at the same time,” said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is a free market so we welcome Xiaomi to issue CDR if it likes after listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform in April was the largest in 25 years in Hong Kong. We may have a party to celebrate the listing of Tsingtao Brewery which was the first H-shares listing in Hong Kong 25 years ago, together with Xiaomi which is the one weighted-voting company to list here. We may see the first wave of strong listings before the summer break.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are Barbarians knocking on Chinese boardroom doors right across the country, and more are likely to follow, say analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The list of Chinese companies - mainly A-share listed, mid-caps with industry competitiveness - becoming embroiled in hostile takeover battles is growing by the day, which experts are now suggesting may start to put undue pressure on the real economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking centre stage, of course, is the ongoing battle royale for </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1">, the country's former biggest property developer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not only has China's biggest homebuilder been fighting off the unwanted attentions of its two largest shareholders in recent months - the little-known insurance firm </span><span class="s3">Baoneng Group</span><span class="s1"> which owns 25.4 per cent of Vanke, and state-owned investment conglomerate </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> which holds 15.3 per cent - it is now having to contend with industry peer </span><span class="s3">China Evergrande Group</span><span class="s1">, which lifted its own stake in the business to 14 per cent on Tuesday, after splashing out more than 12 billion yuan acquiring more shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vanke's founder Wang Shi last year described Baoneng directly as “barbarians” after the insurer built its stake - but its officials are yet to find a seat at the Vanke boardroom table.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zheng Zhigang, a professor of finance with Renmin University, is calling the Vanke saga a “landmark” for China's capital markets, and is certain other similar aggressive takeover tussles are likely to ensue in the coming months.Intrusions by such ‘barbarians' will become a new normal phenomenon, as many Chinese companies have dispersed shareholdingsZheng Zhigang, professor of finance, Renmin University</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Intrusions by such ‘barbarians' will become a new normal phenomenon, as many Chinese companies have dispersed shareholdings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are more than 100 companies listed on A-share market without controlling shareholders, and these are likely to become the obvious first targets,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market is full of opportunists such as Baoneng, but it just so happens Wang Shi was the first to feel its unwanted attentions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a capital market is unable to impose thresholds to prevent such barbarian activity, the innovative ability and the efficiency of the whole society will be at stake, with the net result a negative effect on the real economy,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past fortnight, several companies have seen new shareholders increase their holdings, with the aim of gaining a seat on their boards or even full control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest example came on Thursday last week, when Shanghai-listed China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC), one of the world's largest builders, said in a filing that </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1"> had bought 3 billion of its shares in a week, to became its second biggest shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anbang bought its first 1.5 billion shares the week before. CSCEC said in a statement it “welcomed Anbang as a major investor”.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The day before, meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">Gree Electric Appliances</span><span class="s1">, China's largest air conditioner manufacturer, hit its daily upward limit on the Shenzhen bourse and a 16 month-high share price, triggering market speculation that the capital strong Baoneng was building up a stake in the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Gree</span><span class="s1"> said Baoneng had become its third biggest shareholder with 4.13 per cent stake. Baoneng bought the shares between Nov 17 to 28, according to the filing.Insurance companies have become major acquirers, as many of them are being motivated to seek higher returns after issuance of large amounts of universal insurance products promising high yieldsChen Jie, chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">GF Securities</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And on November 16, seven senior managers, including chairman and CEO of CSG Holdings, a top glass manufacturer listed in Shenzhen, resigned from their positions, after market rumours circulated they had conflict with its new biggest shareholder - none other than Baoneng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Executives from Baoneng-controlled Foresea Life Insurance have since taken over from the departed </span><span class="s3">CSG</span><span class="s1"> executives, the latest filing of the company shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I don't think the bloodshed in </span><span class="s3">CSG</span><span class="s1">'s boardroom is a favourable result for any party, because Baoneng is a top player on the capital market, but not within that industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Faced with this new challenge of capital invasion, we should consider how to improve corporate governance,” Zheng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Issuing unequal voting shares, or the dual-class stock structure adopted by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which guarantees the founders control and power over the company's operation, could be a solution followed by others, he added.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen Jie, chief strategist at </span><span class="s3">GF Securities</span><span class="s1">, says companies with mid-tier market values, high returns on equity, high dividends, while maintaining low valuations and dispersed shareholding structure, were the most likely to be targeted by capital-strong outsiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Insurance companies have become major acquirers, as many of them are being motivated to seek higher returns after issuance of large amounts of universal insurance products promising high yields.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Equity investment took up 14.25 per cent of the total investable assets of China's insurance companies by the end of the third quarter. And that's a long way from the 30 per cent cap set by the insurance regulator,” he said, noting purchase of listed shares by insurance companies would accelerate in the last quarter of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He Fan, chief economist at the Chongyang Institute of Finance, within Renmin University, said what is happening could have implications on the “internet economy”, which is currently booming in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the early days of development by internet start-ups, brains were much more important than capital. However, as the industry evolves and big data becomes the main focus for the bigger players, capital now speaks louder,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">CSG Holdings</span><span class="s1">' annual report in 2014 showed it had a dispersed shareholding structure, with the top shareholder owning just 3.62 per cent stake, while the top three shareholders owns a mere 9.21 per cent stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baoneng started to accumulate its shareholding in the company at the end of 2014, and by the end of September it had become its largest shareholder with a 25.77 per cent stake, and a place in the boardroom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This June, Baoneng requested an extraordinary shareholder meeting to oust the </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1"> board, including founder and chairman Wang Shi - but its request was rejected by the directors</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council proposed yesterday the creation of several new listing boards, including one specialising in companies with unique shareholding structures, in a widely anticipated report which came after the city lost the mega initial public coffering of e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> to New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We recommend that Hong Kong's policymakers, stock exchange and regulators should conduct an overall review on how to change our regulation and market structure to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness to capture companies to have their IPOs here," said Bonnie Chan, the policy research committee member of the council, the government's highest level financial services advisory group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By introducing specialised listing boards, Chan said it would "enable better matching between different types of issuers and investors" and "accommodate innovations in shareholding and management structure". This would help Hong Kong to develop as a hub for firms in specific industries such as mining and natural resources, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A board recognising special shareholder structures would be welcomed by the likes of Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> which all have unique shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laurence Li, convenor of the council's policy research committee, denied the changes are aimed at being tailor-made for any individual firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock through train scheme is implemented later this year, it will attract more companies to list here. We need to make sure our markets are ready for that," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba was in talks last October with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake. The exchange refused to grant an exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle, prompting Alibaba to decide last March to list in the US, where dual class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council proposed that Hong Kong follow London's lead with several markets catering to different companies and investors, including premium and standard boards for companies wanting different regulations. It also has different boards called the alternative, professional or specialist markets which appeal to different investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also looked at how to shorten the IPO period, the requirement of cornerstone investors and the mechanism to allocate shares between institutional and retail investors.</span></p>
