<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record number of Chinese tech and internet companies are rushing to launch IPOs overseas this year, amid the looming shadow of overall tightening credit conditions, which bears a lot of similarities to the dotcom bubble and crash of 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just like what happened in the US nearly two decades ago, many of these IPOs are pushed by the need for cash amid intense funding pressure, as the cheap money era is coming to an end after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> kicked off its rate-increase cycle and there is no sign of China ending its deleveraging campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it is getting increasingly harder to access onshore money from private equity funds, companies are turning to the public equity market for financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said many tech start-ups are trying to catch the last train in the current cycle like what the Chinese internet portals did in 2000, as the issue of survival has become all the more important when winter finally comes. To grab the window of opportunity, many would rather risk a valuation cut and stock volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If history is any guide, today's breed of tech and internet companies could face a similar turnaround in fortunes and experience traumatic changes, leaving only the fittest to survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, 13 Chinese tech and internet service-related IPOs launched this year, raising a combined US$6.86 billion as of September 21 - the highest on booth counts since 1995, according to Dealogic data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The data has not taken into account one of the largest flotations of the year - Xiaomi's US$4.7 billion IPO, which Dealogic categorised as a smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f17fde44-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO wave is part of an overall listing boom. In the first eight months of this year, 150 companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange, up 46 per cent year on year, based on data from the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is in sharp contrast to the market sentiment that has changed significantly from earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since July, nearly 60 per cent of IPOs have fallen below their offer price on the first day of trading. The eight biggest tech IPOs in the past 12 months are all trading below their IPO prices. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, China's biggest online car retailer, has seen its shares plunge nearly 70 per cent from its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index recently entered a technical bear market, reaching a low of 26,613 earlier this month, down more than 20 per cent from a high of 33,484 on January 26. It has since risen, closing at 27,788.52 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f1cfca08-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even retail investors' enthusiasm towards big listings has faded. Online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s IPO earlier this month was barely subscribed by retail buyers, who placed only HK$2.6 billion (US$332.2 million) worth of orders. That is less than one per cent of the HK$370 billion capital that Ping An Good Doctor tied up in its IPO in May. It also pales in comparison with China Literature's HK$520 billion lock-in retail capital last November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But bankers said the IPO window in Hong Kong is still open and will probably stay open for another year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect a healthy IPO pipeline in Hong Kong over the next six to 12 months, despite macro-driven market volatility,” said Sunil Dhupelia, head of equity syndicate for Asia ex-Japan at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese companies, primarily in the TMT [telecommunication, media, and technology] sector, feature prominently in the pipeline.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Hall, co-head of investment banking for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, had similar views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is still a robust IPO pipeline and the momentum is strong. Instead of postponing their IPO agenda, most issuers want to be prepared to catch the right market window. The recent volatility has made investors more selective but they remain tremendously enthusiastic for companies with a solid business model.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance, a leading home-grown investment bank advising on tech IPOs, said the window to list in Hong Kong is open, partly because of the new listing rules that took effect in April. The rules allow companies with dual-class share structure to list and also make it easier for biotech firms to launch their IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“2018 is a bumper year for IPOs. I believe next year will also be [the same],” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dennis Wu, CEO of Hong Kong-based Futu Securities, expected the current IPO boom to last till November and quieten a bit in December, before heating up again next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Hong Kong is among the top IPO destinations in the world and is an open market with free capital flows. “As long as the issuers are good companies at reasonable valuations, you don't need worry about the market's holding capacity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this unprecedented wave of IPOs has been fuelled by the rapid strides taken by Chinese tech firms in the past four to five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few years, many of these firms have made great progress supported by financing from private equity funds. They have matured and reached the IPO stage,” said Bao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin Sha, an analyst at China Industrial Securities, said China's mobile phone penetration rate had surged to 54 per cent in 2017 from 41 per cent in 2014, fuelling a rapid growth in the start-ups offering products or services related to the mobile internet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of these start-ups have seen explosive growth, attracting enormous amounts of private capital amid hefty expectations about their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is similar to how many big internet portals rose in the early 2000s amid the internet revolution back then,” she wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this year, the Chinese private equity market, an important source of funds for start-ups, has tightened significantly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first six months, money raised by private equity funds and venture capital firms plunged 56 per cent year on year on the back of China's ongoing deleveraging efforts, weak domestic equity market, and a slowdown in economic growth complicated by the impact of the trade war with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f21ac92c-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's really hard to access onshore money from private equity funds now,” said Ashley Li, head of asset management at Ping An Securities. “Many LPs [limited partners] have no additional capital to invest [in PE funds], and some even want to cash in on their existing investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Hong Kong-based Partners Capital International, said a large number of PE funds set up in 2013 and 2014 have reached their harvesting phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A PE fund usually has an investment period of three to five years before it exits the portfolio companies. That has caused many PE funds to take the companies they back to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the companies themselves, it becomes imperative to find other sources of funding when uncertainties are on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Tech companies usually need constant blood transfusion in the early stages when they are yet to make a profit and need to keep burning money to support their expansion,” Wan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When winter comes in the current capital market cycle, the most important thing is to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kai Fang, managing director and head of equity capital market at China Renaissance, said it is better for issuers to grab the window of opportunity sooner rather than later given the uncertainties, as long as the company meets the requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We don't know what will happen in the future. Maybe you can't sell [the IPO] at the highest price now, but the top priority is to get it done. No one can predict whether it will become better in the future. So why not now?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there are several motives behind a company's desire to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An IPO is so much more than just going public. It means a company can access more financing channels, boost its reputation and attract talent, and have a stronger bargaining position when talking to clients or even creditors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bruce Wu, co-head of </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1">'s Greater China equity capital markets group, agreed it is important to grab the window as long as it's open.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The volatility may cause issuers to recalibrate their timing, but they will persist with their plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This unprecedented IPO wave has rekindled memories of what happened 18 years ago when the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> crashed after reaching a peak of 5,048 in March 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting in June 1999, amid the dotcom boom, the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its benchmark rate six times within one year, from 4.75 per cent to 6.5 per cent in May 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around that time, the US stock market embraced a concentrated IPO wave. 115 and 112 companies went public in 1999 and 2000 respectively, compared to the annual average of 72 between 1991 and 1996, according to data compiled by China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's four biggest internet portals at the time - China.com, Sina.com, NetEase and </span><span class="s3">Sohu.com</span><span class="s1"> - also listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> from July 1999 to July 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the bursting of the dotcom bubble in March 2000 hit IPOs hard. Not only did NetEase and Sohu have to briefly postpone their listing plans and cut fundraising targets, but also saw their shares drop quickly as the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> plummeted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> lost nearly 80 per cent of its value from its peak to a low of 1,114 in 2002, a period which many people call as the internet's nuclear winter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list itself is a success,” Wang Zhidong, founder and then CEO of Sina, said in an interview with Beijing Youth Daily in 2000. “We caught the last train. The window was closing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Zhang, CEO of Sohu, was then quoted as saying that it was not as if the company would have died had it not listed. “But the IPO significantly increased our chances of survival.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2161035/xiaomis-share-surge-falls-victim-investor-worries-over-outlook]Eighteen years later, those comments resonate with Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list is a huge success for Xiaomi, given the volatility on the capital market,” Lei said in an open letter in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi raised US$4.7 billion in Hong Kong, the largest tech flotation of the year. But the fundraising value had to be cut by almost half from its initial target, as the company and banks became cautious amid a weak market and lacklustre investor interest. Its shares currently trade below its offer price, falling victim to worries over the outlook for Chinese tech firms and the US-China trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analysts agreed that what is going on now bears some resemblance to the past in terms of the funding environment for tech companies.In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will surviveBao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although I don't think it will be as destructive as the bursting of the bubble back then, we need to be aware of a possible sharp turnaround in expectations for the new breed of tech and internet companies,” Wan from Partners Capital said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a tech company mainly relies on burning cash to support its business without a viable business model, it easily dies when the environment becomes harsher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The end of the dotcom boom saw about 210 US internet companies go bankrupt because of the broken capital chain, as it was hard to access financing, according to data from China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the bubble in the tech sector burst in the 2000s, many companies experienced a painful transformation, as their valuations were reassessed,” said Lin from the Chinese securities firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those that survived bear three key characteristics: cautious investments, cost control, and how fast the company can monetise its traffic and achieve earnings, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fan from China Renaissance holds similar views, as he sees the ability to manage cash flows important to the survival of a tech company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will survive.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) expects to let the first company with a dual-class share structure list in the second half of this year as it looks to complement the Chinese onshore and Asian capital markets in allowing tech firms to raise funds, bourse officials told a media briefing in Hong Kong on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX said that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong are planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a have a dual-class listing structure that has operations in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Chinese companies make up 20 per cent of the market cap of companies listed in Singapore, according to Chew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We see ourselves playing an offshore complementary role to the emerging markets in Asia and that includes China and to a certain extent Hong Kong companies that are looking to expand overseas,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is expected to release its dual class share rules in the coming weeks and aims to be a lot more freer than other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, if you list an IPO in Hong Kong, the cornerstone investor is expected to be locked up for six months, but Singapore will not have that issue,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore may provide value when it come to the Chinese companies expanding their international business, and is likely to continue to attract consumer, tech, health care, REITs and infrastructure companies that want to extend their “overseas ambitions”, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street unthreatened by Hong Kong's IPO rule changes[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2133566/wall-street-cheers-hong-kongs-ipo-rules-revamp-sees-new-yorks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly 40 per cent of all companies listed on SGX are international and account for more than 50 per cent of total market cap. Whereas only 6 per cent of all companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange are non-Chinese companies, according to data from the two exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's revamped IPO rules will take effect soon, allowing start-ups valued at US$1.5 billion to list shares under a dual-class shares scheme. Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has chosen the city over New York for its mega-IPO because of the planned reforms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore is a more international market than Hong Kong in terms of investors and companies that raise capital, Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it is a Chinese focused technology business Hong Kong does better; we acknowledge that. But when it is pan-Asia business and Southeast Asia business then we a little bit better off,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese technology businesses developing international applications and looking to expand such as into South East Asia and South Asia under China's Belt and Road Initiative may choose Singapore to obtain better valuations and attention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International investors from the US, Japan and Korea that want to invest in emerging Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia but cannot get access to the markets directly could also use Singapore to invest into these companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> is a far more international destination,” Chew said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is a matter for the market to decide," he said, adding that if changes were to be pursued, consultation was necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His remarks followed a call from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in his blog last week that consideration should be given to non-standard shareholding structures for "innovative companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rumours circulating in the market yesterday said a timetable for consultation to pave the way for Alibaba's listing plan would be set at an HKEx quarterly meeting tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx declined to comment. "It is a decision of the stock exchange listing committee and the Securities and Futures Commission if a market consultation on shareholding structure will be conducted," it told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christfund Securities research director Simon Lam Ka-hang said he would support discussion of the listing regulations but would vote against any changes to them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The current listing rules should not be changed because the interests of small shareholders must be protected," Lam said. "As an investor, I welcome any company to come and list in Hong Kong, with a precondition that it protect the interests of small shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba abandoned a listing in Hong Kong just weeks ago because regulators would not allow the company's partners - including founder Jack Ma Yun and some senior executives - to nominate the majority of directors on its board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators said the so-called partnership structure gave one group of shareholders more power than another and breached the "one shareholder, one vote" principle that underpins Hong Kong's securities laws.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said it was important to solicit views from market participants and compared Hong Kong to the Wimbledon tennis championships, saying no rules could be changed if the game was under way.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I recently read a book that said Hong Kong is like Wimbledon and that people come here to play," he said. "It is important that we have rules that are clear, we have rules that are consistent and that it is transparent to everyone."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma said in Hangzhou last week that Alibaba would hold off on a listing for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's equity capital markets have put in a strong performance for the first nine months of the year, raising almost 45 per cent more than in the period last year. However, many in the market are still focused on what could have been.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s record-breaking initial public offering in the US this month has added impetus to a push for the city to re-examine whether the stock exchange operator should change its listing rules to enable the kind of dual-class share structure that the e-commerce giant had sought for a Hong Kong listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, companies raised US$40.9 billion in Hong Kong's equity markets in the year to September, including IPOs, follow-on deals and convertible bond offerings, a 44.4 increase from the year-earlier period, according to preliminary data by Thomson Reuters. The nine-month haul represents 88 per cent of the capital raised for all of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Follow-on deals, in which listed companies issue new shares to the public and block trades, dropped 26.5 per cent year on year to US$21.2 billion for the period, despite Citic Pacific raising US$6.9 billion in August for its asset injection deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is undergoing a transitional period in which the Chinese city needs to recover quickly from the loss of Alibaba's flotation, the most important event in recent listing history," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY in Hong Kong. He is keen to see more private-sector listings after most state-owned enterprises - a one-timer pillar of the city's IPO market - have gone public over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised US$25 billion in its New York listing, making it the world's biggest IPO, valuing the firm at about US$250 billion based on the first day's trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate over the way Hong Kong handled Alibaba's proposed listing structure has continued to simmer. On one side are those who argue the city should have shown flexibility in accommodating Alibaba's wish for a dual-class share arrangement. Countering that view are defenders of the status quo who say the exchange was right to not bend its rules for the sake of one company, fearing the consequences for investor protection in the absence of US-style class-action lawsuits. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> began consultations on a rule change at the end of last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong lost Alibaba, it did welcome an influx of mainland private companies listing their shares. These firms are drawn to the city to avoid a cumbersome regulatory approval process at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, a number of these small share sales sparked concerns over the quality of the mainland companies coming to the market. Ding Hui, the chairman of retailer Fujian Nuoqi, went missing after transferring HK$291 million in cash out of the company's accounts, soon after Nuoqi's January IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also suffered the embarrassment of missing out on a wave of Chinese internet companies that bypassed the city for listings in the US. JD.com China's second-largest e-commerce firm, raised US$2 billion in New York, and social network platform Weibo raised US$286 million in a US public offering, partly due again to the dual-class issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation now under way over a change to the listing rules comes as the city's exchange tries to play catch-up with its US counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some market professionals are prepared to look beyond the Alibaba setback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mathias Helleu, chairman of 8 Securities, said: "We do not think sentiment in Hong Kong has been dented after the Alibaba IPO listing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, chief executive of Cathay Conning Asset Management, said: "Missing out on Alibaba IPO only had a very temporary impact on the HK stock market sentiment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">, said economic concerns in China and the US Federal Reserve's plan to end its bond-buying programme could affect the listing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first nine months, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> remained the top performer in the Hong Kong equity capital markets, followed by </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A contentious proposal to allow dual share listings on Hong Kong's bourse emerged top of the agenda at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by the chief executive, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forum, championed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] and chaired by the finance chief, held its first meeting on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po[http://www.scmp.com/topics/paul-chan] confirmed the attendees had discussed whether to allow dual-class share companies to list in the city after receiving separate briefings from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We had a very good discussion with some very good opinions raised,” Chan told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He revealed the two market bodies would do “follow-up work” on what had been discussed and that the forum would meet again next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A government statement quoted Chan as saying at the closed-door meeting: “The Government attaches great importance to enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. While we endeavour to uphold market quality, we should also actively seek to further develop and broaden our capital markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the meeting, HKEX, operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, set out its proposal for the establishment of a third board to give companies with dual-share structures a way to list as well as those with no track record of profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The public consultation ended earlier this month, with financial industry professionals still divided over the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia, who is not a member of the forum, presented on Wednesday.Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit?Dr David Wong Yau-kar, MPF Schemes Authority</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's support reflects a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it deemed the proposal at the time lacking sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As recently as last month, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder, also a forum member, said there was a need to reposition Hong Kong's listed market amid the shrinking size of initial public offerings in the past decade and trading volume in newly listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there was a need to strike a balance between “a healthier supply of interesting companies” at the top end of the stock market and greater demand by investors for more diverse companies at the lower end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source at the meeting revealed that the consultation showed consensus on broadening markets and allowing dual-class shares but opinion was split on how to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carrie Lam, who met the forum members before they had their pow-wow, was quoted in the government press release as saying that the financial services sector, as a pillar industry contributing 18 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, should seize opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area proposal to “better serve our real economy”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many major technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> offer dual-class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. Unlike the US, Hong Kong bars such shares, favouring the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forum member Dr David Wong Yau-kar, chairman of the Mandatory Provident Fund[http://www.scmp.com/topics/mpf] Schemes Authority, noted the attendees on Wednesday had raised their views on the proposed third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most people agree Hong Kong should attract new-economy companies to list here, but the question is how to do it. Do we need a new board?” he asked. “Do we accept dual-class share companies? Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit? There are many different ways to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong added he could not detail individual views or the government's stance, citing confidentiality.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other forum members include Hong Kong Monetary Authority[http://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-monetary-authority] Chief Executive Norman Chan Tak-lam, Securities and Futures Commission CEO Ashley Alder, and Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Executive councillors Bernard Chan, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, Chow Chung-kong and Joseph Yam Chi-kwong are also members, as are Carlson Tong Ka-shing and Moses Cheng Mo-chi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 30 government reports on financial matters were distributed to the 10 forum members to keep track of proposals and their implementation and they agreed to meet again in the next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong described the forum as not a decision-making body but a high-ranking consultation group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Carrie Lam is very concerned about the group, as she initiated it in her manifesto,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chief executive announced the forum during her election campaign earlier this year, saying the government should play a more active and leading role in policymaking and matters of monetary stability, financial safety and regulation. The idea was to reinforce Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam believed the forum could offer a platform to discuss strategic and forward-looking proposals and keep track of the implementation of such proposals by government departments and other relevant parties.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies chairman, Francis Leung Pak-to, also known as “father of red chips” said on Monday that the chamber supported the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed separate board to list dual class share companies here, but not new start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has just ended a consultation last Friday for the third board's establishment, whose listing requirements differ from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, essentially aimed at providing a listing venue for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two platforms: a premium market that is open to all investors and will host companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but have a dual-class share structure which the exchange currently disallows. The second is for start-ups where only professional investors can invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung was opposed to the start-up board for the high risks that entailed. “Many start-ups lack track records and have a high risk of failure. They are not suitable to be traded on the stock exchange,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He supported however, the launch of a separate board only for the dual class shares with a market capitalisation of HK$8 billion, which is similar to a so-called unicorn new economy firm valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list here,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are plenty of mainland “unicorns” which would be interested to list in Hong Kong, but our market needs to prepare itself for these companies. This is why we would need this new board that accept dual class share companies to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many big technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are dual class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than the others. Hong Kong bans such types of companies to list but US allows it, which has led mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to go for a listing in New York in 2014, instead of Hong Kong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list hereFrancis Leung Pak-to, Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Three years after losing Alibaba and our market still has done nothing to address the issue. We need to make sure our market can capture these companies to list. This is why we need to introduce the third board soon,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third board for new-economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I introduced the red chips in Hong Kong in the 1990s, there were many criticisms that these companies are different from other H-shares. But then, we have many successful listings - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Citic, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> - and they are still heavily traded by investors,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A red chip is a company incorporated in Hong Kong but has a mainland parent, which is different from an H-share company which is established in the mainland but listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also against the HKEX's proposal to let US-listed mainland companies seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This rule will turn Hong Kong into a second-tier market as most big players will go list in the US and then seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. We oppose to this proposal,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> has opposed to dual class share listings as they reduce the ability for fund managers to exercise their voting rights to decide on the remuneration, director appointments and other important corporate affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund body said the development of dual class shares were “negative” to investor protection and urged the exchange to stick to “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A new board is among the measures </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) will consider in its bid to lure more technology start-ups to list on the city's bourse, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 343 companies to list in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013, only 22, or 6 per cent of the total, were technology related, according to HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to introduce a dual-shares structure on the grounds that it would violate the long-held principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-share structures, which allow shares with unequal voting rights to be listed, are popular with technology firms, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate had raged for years on the issue, but the topic was thrust into the spotlight two years ago when Chinese e-commerce juggernaut </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, opted to list its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Losing out on a listing by Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has been costly for the Hong kong exchange, financially and in terms of market development.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Thursday, turnover of Alibaba shares was US$2.75 billion (HK$21.43 billion) - equivalent to almost a third of total Hong Kong stock market turnover of HK$65 billion on the same day. HKEX's turnover would get a significant boost from the increased trading fees, while brokers would benefit from higher commission income from these trades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised a record-breaking US$25 billion from its IPO in the US in 2014. Its decision to choose New York meant Hong Kong lost out that year as the world's largest IPO market. HKEX also missed out on an initial listing fee of HK$650,000 and an annual listing fee of HK$1.19 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No doubt these are among the factors that have prompted HKEX to examine ways of lowering the entry barriers for new tech companies wishing to float their stock here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should have a new board, or we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets for the new start-ups and innovation companies to list here,” Li said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments came as regional competition among bourses looking to attract a new generation of technology start-ups intensified.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bourse to study measures to attract more tech start-ups to raise funds in the city[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2012287/hong-kong-bourse-study-measures-attract-more-tech-start-ups-raise]?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) on Monday won approval from its listing advisory committee to allow companies to list dual-shares structures, favoured by many start-ups as many of their founders hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It may be a necessary measure for Singapore's bourse, which has attracted few IPOs in recent years, but some analysts point out that the move is risky as up to 90 per cent of start-ups fail.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the US market has shown such structures can attract big tech players to list. The top 25 dual-share structure companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and LikedIn in the US have a combined market cap of US$927.42 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies, such as Baidu and Weibo, listed in the US, 29 of them have dual-class structures. Baidu's founder, for example, has only a 15.9 per cent stake in the company but has a voting right of 53.5 per cent.We will study whether we should have a new board or adopt a new disclosure regime for the new start-ups to list hereCharles Li Xiaojia, chief executive, HKEX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had wanted to list in Hong Kong in 2013 with a structure that would have allowed founder Jack Ma and key executives to nominate half of the board, but the dual-share arrangement has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX in 2014 began consulting the market about the possibility of permitting dual-share structures here, but the exercise ground to a halt when the SFC opposed the idea, fearing it would undermine investor protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city is not lacking start-ups. They just choose not to raise funds through HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main board's requirement for HK$50 million in profit in the three years ahead of a listing is considered to be too high for start-ups, as is the Growth Enterprise Market's stipulation of a cash flow of HK$20 million in the previous two years of operation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing reforms that would increase the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s power in listing matters are likely to join the list of failed reforms, after they were resoundingly rejected by most of the respondents to a consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals in a joint consultation paper by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the SFC centred on establishing two committees - one for policy and one for regulatory issues - on top of the existing listing committee, with equal representation by the SFC and HKEX, to approve complicated new listings and set listing policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This would upend the current structure whereby HKEX's listing division staff give preliminary approval to a listing and can suggest listing rule changes, which are then submitted to the 28-member listing committee of accountants, lawyers, executives of listed firms and fund managers for final approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposals</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">for fear that the change would allow the SFC to overregulate. As they have in past reforms, the listed companies again led the opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the stiff opposition, the reforms would be difficult to proceed without any modification, and the current deadlock is not a first. Previous failures in the past 15 years have ranged from delisting, quarterly reporting and restrictions on cornerstone investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are the reforms that were proposed and why they failed:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Companies to report results every three months instead of every six months, in line with international practice</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Plan was abandoned one year later after public consultation drew strong opposition from companies, including blue chips such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">. They argued that it would increase costs and prompt the management to chase short-term profits</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Move to delist companies trading below 50 HK cents for a full month</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: HK$10 billion in value was wiped off the market a day after the consultation paper was released as investors rushed to dump penny stocks. HKEX scrapped the public consultation exercise four days later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government accepted an expert group's report on the penny-stock fiasco and decided to shift the listing division and regulatory powers from HKEX to the SFC and remove the conflict of interest of HKEX as a listed company and regulator</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Stiff opposition from companies, brokers and those who feared the change would enable the SFC to become too powerful. The government backtracked and abandoned the plan one month later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government wanted to add part of the listing rules into the law; companies and directors that failed to disclose price-sensitive information could face a maximum 10-year jail term and a fine of HK$10 million</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: With strong opposition from companies and fears of the SFC becoming too powerful, the plan was dropped. In 2010, the government proposed that breaches could be a civil offence with a maximum fine of HK$8 million. The law was supported and enacted in 2013</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce quarterly results reporting in two phases: bigger firms with a market capitalisation of at least HK$10 billion would start in September 2008 while smaller ones would do it in September</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan was dropped after stiff opposition from companies, including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX attempted to restrict tycoons or certain investors from becoming cornerstone investors in initial public offerings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan received stiff opposition from tycoons and investment banks. The regulation has not been tightened and cornerstone investors still have a place in numerous listings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce the British style of quarterly reporting in 2009 where companies give only broad performance outlines. In 2011, it wanted companies to follow the US style of quarterly reporting with more detailed numbers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The proposals were dropped after stiff opposition from the companies including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought to extend the period banning directors from trading shares from two months in a year to up to seven months</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: More than 200 listed companies voiced their opposition with an open letter published in newspapers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought views on whether dual-class share structures should be introduced after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for a listing in New York over Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Mixed views were received. HKEX in June 2015 launched a second round of consultation to allow big companies to have dual-class structures, but SFC banned it a week later. HKEX said it would launch a consultation in the second quarter of 2017 to introduce a third board to attract technology firms and other new economy firms, which would allow dual-class share structure firms to list</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX and the SFC jointly issue a consultation paper to allow SFC to take more front-line role in listing regulation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposal as listed companies, brokers and lawyers generally feared the change would lead the SFC to overregulate and hence hurt the listing market. The SFC and HKEX said they would review the comments before making any consultation</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's little success in introducing listing reforms over the years is an age-old story of money and power struggles.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once again, the latest listing reform proposals were overwhelmingly rejected by the majority of respondents to a consultation paper, as many were worried that the changes arming the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> with more power, could kill the city's multibillion dollar initial public offering market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals issued in a joint consultation paper in June last year by the SFC and the Hong Kong stock exchange, would allow the SFC to take a bigger role in the early stages of listing matters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Central to the reforms is the establishment of two new committees - a listing regulatory committee and a listing policy committee - with equal representation from the SFC and HKEX. The regulatory committee will handle applications deemed complicated by the exchange's listing division. The second panel will decide on policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new structure will replace the current system in which the SFC can only reject the policies or listing approvals made by the stock exchange and the 28-member listing committee that comprises representatives of listed companies, bankers, brokers, lawyers and accountants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The controversial proposals which underwent consultation from June to November, would have been difficult to proceed. A staggering 94 per cent of respondents - or 8,000 out of the 8,500 submissions received - said no to reforms, with listed companies, brokers and lawyers being the biggest opposers while support came from accountants and fund managers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compromise is likely outcome of Hong Kong listing reform as opposing camps stand firm[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2047370/compromise-likely-outcome-hong-kong-listing-reform]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Uncannily, the supporters and opponents use a football analogy to describe the SFC's role in the reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC now acts only as a goalkeeper in a match. The proposed changes will allow it to play the roles of a defender and midfielder while the HKEX will remain as the striker," Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing told the South China Morning Post in an interview last June to explain the benefits of the reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Support also came from former government senior officials such as former Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Frederick Ma Si-hang, who believes the change would enhance market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC tells Hong Kong Exchange to rethink dual-share structure reform[http://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/1827259/sfc-tells-hong-kong-exchange-rethink-dual-share-structure-reform]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The opposing forces on the other hand, have a different version of the analogy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC is now playing the role of a defender, but the proposed reform will turn the agency into a striker, which gives it too much power," said Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung, the vice-chairman of the pro-business Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong and a reform opponent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam, along with brokers, listed companies and lawyers feared that the SFC will replace the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> as the frontline regulators to approve new listings and setlisting matters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC may bring in tougher regulations which may incite risks of over-regulation and make it harder for local small and medium-sized companies to raise funds," Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lo Ka-shui, vice chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies who had publicly slammed the proposals for giving too much power to the SFC, warned that the reforms may kill off the listing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Look at the real estate investment trust market, which is solely regulated by the SFC. It is dead," Lo pointed out. "If the SFC was the one to approve new listing, the IPO market will be dead too."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO market involves huge sums of money and million-dollar earnings for financial and professional services intermediaries, which makes any reforms over listing matters controversial.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past 20 years, Hong Kong has ranked number two in the global IPO market - 1,172 companies have raised a total of US$388 billion between 1997 and the first quarter of 2017. It tailed New York's US$675.8 billion, but surpassed </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, London and Shanghai, which raised US$339.3 billion, US$292.7 billion and US$235.1 billion respectively, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's true that the IPOs are bringing in huge sums of money to the various sectors. This is why many listed companies and some brokers are opposed to the proposed reform," said Albert Au Siu-cheung, senior adviser of accounting firm BDO and a director of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Au rejected the idea that the reforms will kill the IPO market, calling it "irrational".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed reforms are aimed at enhancing market quality as we have seen some new listings performed poorly. Only if we improved the market quality, we can then attract more good quality companies to list and investors to trade here," he said, adding that this was why many accountants and fund managers have supported the reforms</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, urged the SFC to listen to the various voices from the consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I believe the reforms would become acceptable if the SFC would modify them. While many brokers are opposed to the provisions for the SFC to be involved in approving new listings. But there are many proponents for the SFC to discuss with the HKEX about setting listing policies at the early stage, instead of just rejecting what the HKEX proposed," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A case in point, Cheung said that the HKEX could rope in the SFC, government officials and brokers to discuss the setting up the third board and the policies to attract technology and new economy firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) is weighing a third board, introducing cross-border initial public offering (IPO) and launch a new commodities platform in Shenzhen in the next three years, said chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unveiling the exchange operator's three-year strategic plan and its new logo in a media briefing on Thursday, Li said HKEx is focusing on expanding the "connect" schemes between Hong Kong and mainland China, a priority that is reflected in the new logo.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Shenzhen stock connect scheme will come next. There are no concrete plans for other connect schemes but we plan to build up many of these as bridges to connect China with international investors and to help mainland investors invest in international products in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the list of new connects will be a primary equity connect, or IPO connect, to allow mainlanders subscribe to Hong Kong IPO and international investors subscribe to mainland IPO.READ MORE: Local brokerages don't have much to cheer about as stock connect celebrates its first anniversary</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That will attract many international firms to list in Hong Kong to capture the mainland investor base," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another plan to boost new listings is the third board to attract innovative companies to the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some have urged us to lower the listing requirements to attract innovative companies to list here. Some want us to raise the bar to keep out bad companies. These conflicting views make it hard to change the existing market. A new board may allow us to have new rules for new companies to raise funds. But this is my idea. The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) will make the decision," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC had opposed the idea of allowing </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> to list in Hong Kong with a share structure that would allow the top management of the e-commerce giant to nominate the majority of the board even with a minority stake. Alibaba eventually listed in New York in 2014 in a mega fundraising, prompting the city to review its listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also plans a commodities platform in Shenzhen. "This would allow mainlanders to trade </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> products in China," he said, without providing a timetable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed bourse will tie up with commodities exchanges in Hong Kong and London, and maybe other mainland commodities exchanges in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx bought the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest, in 2012 as the first step towards expanding into commodities and reduce its reliance on equities. Three years on, HKEx has launched six metal products in Hong Kong but only a few of them are trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the tie-up would bring </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> products to Hong Kong to make it easier for mainland investors to trade here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The next step in cross-border financial integration would be to introduce a bond connect and a derivatives connect, said Li, adding HKEx would also seek to improve the one-year old stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong linked up with Shanghai in November 2014 in the first cross-border trading scheme, giving international investors access to Shanghai-listed shares via Hong Kong brokers. Mainland investors with 500,000 yuan (HK$592,000) in their securities accounts were similarly allowed to trade Hong Kong stocks through mainland brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A similar Shenzhen-Hong Kong scheme was originally planned to be launched by the end of last year but was delayed by the last summer's market rout in China. No new timetable has been announced for the proposed scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx is also focusing on yuan products, with the exchange operator keen to increase its offerings to meet the needs of international traders seeking to hedge currency risks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the present volatility in the stock and currency markets would not affect the exchange's expansion plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are offering the products to investors who need them, not because the markets are good," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan's HK$33.14 billion fundraising will make it Hong Kong's second blockbuster tech float this year after Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, and possibly the biggest for an internet services company since </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$200 million in 2004.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the company exercises an over-allotment option, the IPO value could rise by 15 per cent to US$4.8 billion. That would make Meituan's listing the third largest in Hong Kong this year, after telecoms tower operator China Tower and Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the offer price, Meituan is seeking a valuation of around US$52.4 billion - 75 per cent above its most recent fundraising round last October, when it was valued at US$30 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock is expected to start trading on Hong Kong's main board from September 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market observers, however, are a bit cautious about the IPO's prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I understand some of the tycoons are interested in subscribing however, for the general public, the market sentiment is not optimistic and that affects the market response,” said Gordon Tsui, managing director of Hantec Pacific.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The pricing is more than expected, and the general market is suffering from negative news like the trade war and an unstable yuan. They have suffered from the downside of the market and may not have new funding to subscribe.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The internet firm will also become the second listed company on the Hong Kong stock exchange to have a weighted voting rights share structure, which gives founders greater voting power over minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five cornerstone investors had previously agreed to invest a combined US$1.5 billion, according to its prospectus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York-based investment firm Oppenheimer Fund is the largest cornerstone investor, committing US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent, which already owns a 20 per cent stake in Meituan, is investing US$400 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">London-based hedge fund Lansdowne Partners and New York-based asset manager Darsana Capital Partners have agreed to put in US$300 million and US$200 million respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Structural Reform Fund, a state-owned restructuring fund backed by shareholders including China Chengtong Holdings, China Merchants Group and </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, will invest US$100 million.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class shares listing rules must reform to protect investors and prevent an erosion of corporate governance, the </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of people think that because dual-class shares structures work in other jurisdictions it will immediately, effortlessly translate into an APAC context,” said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1">. "We are trying to challenge some of those preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's listing rules changed in April to allow companies with dual-class shares to float on the bourse, giving founders and key management stronger voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Western countries, including the US, have had such rules in place for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, Tokyo implemented the change in 2015 and Singapore in June, but no companies have listed so far in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has traditionally been defined by a "one-share, one-vote” system, meaning all shareholders enjoy proportional representation in company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Hong Kong could not offer </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> a dual-class structure was thought to be a strong reason the Chinese tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014, and was indicative of the city losing out as an IPO destination. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms - aimed at attracting tech companies who want to maximise valuation and see their founders' vision through - have drawn two of the city's biggest tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi raised HK$54 billion (US$4.7 billion), while in September Beijing-based online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised HK$52.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in a survey carried out by </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> in March this year, 97 per cent of their members in Asia-Pacific believed safeguards were needed to protect investors from a few controlling stakeholders, according to a report published on Tuesday, named "Dual-class Shares: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong already offers an "event-based sunset”, where founders' stronger voting rights collapse if they leave the company or transfer shares. But more is needed, argued CFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global association of investment professionals recommended a mandatory "time-based sunset” where super voting rights will collapse to regular shareholder voting rights after no longer than five years post-IPO, to protect investors from a lack of control in their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insufficient investor protection was noted by 53 per cent of respondents as a key risk of dual-class shares, while 52 per cent highlighted the skewed proportionality between ownership and control, and 28 per cent identified an erosion of corporate governance standards.The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountableMary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountable,” said Leung. "No matter what public shareholders want, there is a limitation to what they can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the structure may make sense at the time of IPO, we don't believe it should carry on forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> of 157 dual-class structure IPOs in the US since the early 2000s found companies with ongoing weighted voting rights and those that allowed collapsed super voting rights, had similar valuations in the first two years after floating. From the third year, however, companies with collapsed voting rights began trading at a higher valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CFA respondents were also worried about their lack of education on how to invest in companies with dual-class share structures. The survey founds 60 per cent said they had no experience investing in such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some argue we don't need rules as we are all grown ups, in Asia because there is so much retail investment in the market when things go wrong, they look to the regulators,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Are we set up in the right way to look after these people? Investors must of course do due diligence on what they are buying, but a great deal of work can be done to raise awareness and education levels.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For average investors on both sides of the border, the latest announcement on the stock connect schemes by China's new central bank chief can only be welcome news. Speaking at the </span><span class="s3">Boao Forum for Asia</span><span class="s1">, Yi Gang revealed a plan to quadruple the daily quota on the Hong Kong-Shanghai and Hong Kong-Shenzhen stock connect schemes from May 1. This means the daily southbound quota will be increased to 42 billion yuan (HK$53 billion) from 10.5 billion yuan and the northbound quota will be raised to 52 billion yuan from 13 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another scheme is afoot to establish a trading link with London by the end of the year. For mainland investors who have long complained about the dearth of quality stocks available, the latest measures will provide greater and better scope for investment and diversification. They are part of the reform of the mainland financial system to encourage both foreign and domestic investment. One aim is to persuade Chinese technology giants to list domestically, and to make the stock connect schemes more attractive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks end higher after daily quotas quadrupled for Stock Connect links[https://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2141185/hong-kong-stocks-expected-open-lower-despite-easing-trade]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland retail investors have long had a sense there are few quality mainland shares and that all top firms have chosen to list overseas, usually in Hong Kong or the United States. This has made for volatile trading. When retail investors make money they are happy, but when they lose they tend to blame the government, often with vocal protests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chart of the day: Symbolic move in China's stock quota increase[https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2141693/chart-day-symbolic-move-chinas-stock-quota-increase]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For social harmony and the health of the financial system, officials have a strong incentive to encourage such established firms to come home for listing. Given the high levels of household savings, mainland investors are highly liquid; and foreign investors are also eager to take advantage of the promised opening. So there is huge potential for the companies to raise capital domestically and, if they do, they would probably be allowed to retain their dual share structure to maintain their overseas listings as well as management control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why more foreign institutions are buying Chinese stocks[https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/2132932/why-more-foreign-institutions-are-buying-chinese-stocks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In trying to tighten financial risks, Beijing is right to promote quality listings at home. Among these are the well-known tech brands, whose presence in the stock connect scheme will prove to be a significant boost. But, at the same time, mainland authorities need to strengthen regulations. Since the recent market turbulence, it's clear to top policymakers that loose regulations and loopholes must be plugged so companies do not manipulate the market so easily. Part of this realisation has been a determined effort to crack down on so-called big crocodiles, financial players with enough resources and connections to play the system. There has also been an overhaul of regulatory bodies for insurance and the stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Transparency and fairness through improved regulations are key to providing a proper environment for investors. They deserve no less.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council proposed yesterday the creation of several new listing boards, including one specialising in companies with unique shareholding structures, in a widely anticipated report which came after the city lost the mega initial public coffering of e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> to New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We recommend that Hong Kong's policymakers, stock exchange and regulators should conduct an overall review on how to change our regulation and market structure to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness to capture companies to have their IPOs here," said Bonnie Chan, the policy research committee member of the council, the government's highest level financial services advisory group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By introducing specialised listing boards, Chan said it would "enable better matching between different types of issuers and investors" and "accommodate innovations in shareholding and management structure". This would help Hong Kong to develop as a hub for firms in specific industries such as mining and natural resources, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A board recognising special shareholder structures would be welcomed by the likes of Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> which all have unique shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laurence Li, convenor of the council's policy research committee, denied the changes are aimed at being tailor-made for any individual firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock through train scheme is implemented later this year, it will attract more companies to list here. We need to make sure our markets are ready for that," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba was in talks last October with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake. The exchange refused to grant an exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle, prompting Alibaba to decide last March to list in the US, where dual class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council proposed that Hong Kong follow London's lead with several markets catering to different companies and investors, including premium and standard boards for companies wanting different regulations. It also has different boards called the alternative, professional or specialist markets which appeal to different investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also looked at how to shorten the IPO period, the requirement of cornerstone investors and the mechanism to allocate shares between institutional and retail investors.</span></p>
