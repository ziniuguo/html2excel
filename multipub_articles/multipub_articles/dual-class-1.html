<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) busies itself consulting on detailed trading rule changes, to pave the likely way for companies seeking dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, it's time to outline exactly what their inclusion in the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index would mean.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a proposal by HKEX, a one-month consultation period ends on March 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its plan is to attract three categories of new-economy companies to list here: large biotech companies without revenue, giant dual-class shareholding structured new economies companies, and US-listed mainland new-economy companies looking for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting right over other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are popular among many tech firms such as US tech firm </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, and pointedly mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns South China Morning Post. The fact Hong Kong could not then offer Alibaba a dual-class structure was seen as a strong reason why the tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With several “unicorns” (start-ups worth more than US$1 billion) expected to seek public funding in the not-too-distant future, such as Xiaomi, WeLab, Lufax, and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">, officials in Hong Kong are anxious not to have a repeat of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX expects to start accepting dual-class applications, soon after the end of the consultation's conclusion in late April, with the first dual-class share companies floating in the city as early as June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But we still don't know whether or when successful dual-listed companies will eventually be allowed to be included in the benchmark Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's important, as many passive fund managers track the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index. If such companies were be added to these indexes, they could be accessed by a much larger pool of institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then there are the Stock Connect share trading links between the Hong Kong exchange and its peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen to consider, which only allow the trading of stocks listed on the major Hang Seng Indexes (again, the Hang Seng Index or Hang Seng Composite Index) to qualify, and in which mainlanders and mainland mutual funds have readily invested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently up to 10 per cent of Hong Kong exchange's turnover comes via southbound trading over the Stock Connect links.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So if these stocks are not allowed to be included in the major indexes, mainlanders would unable to buy them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Indexes Company, which compiles the benchmark indices, completed its own public consultation on the issue, ending On February 28 - but it's still yet to publish its conclusions nearly a fortnight on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market participants themselves, say they still have mixed views on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers, supports the inclusion of dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index, giving a green light to mainlanders to plough into them via Stock Connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many passive fund managers, however, oppose the suggestion, as once dual-class shares are included in the leading Hang Seng indexes, they fear they would have no choice but to focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other fund managers express reservations on the dual-class structure as it violate the city's “one-share, one vote” rule - an important principle for listed companies in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Globally, New York's S&amp;P and London's FTSE indexed have not included these companies in some of their indexes, as in some cases they add restrictions on calculating their weighting on a gauge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MSCI, another major index complier, is also consulting the market on their inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland exchanges consider allowing them, we are going to see more of these companies listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any blanket ban on them appearing in major indexes would be unlikely - but we are likely to see some restrictions coming with such issuances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In many sector the adage that “uncertainty breeds opportunity” rings true, but not in this case. Markets hate it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And so it's now doubly important the Hang Seng Indexes Company and other compilers announce their final decision on dual-class shares, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's largest investment fund managers urged the Hong Kong stock exchange operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), to introduce more safeguards for protecting minority investors' interests when the bourse allows multiple class shareholding technology companies to list from June, in a seminar on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many fund managers who are also members of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> have opposed allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong as this is in breach of the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKIFA still believes that ‘one share, one vote' is best for investors. But with the listing reform a done deal, we will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list here,” said Sally Wong, the association's chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding companies are favoured by technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, as they allow founders and certain shareholders to retain more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies seeking to list dual-class shares may get green light to apply for Hong Kong listing by end June[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/article/2128434/companies-seeking-list-dual-class-shares-may-get-green]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in 2014 as Hong Kong has banned dual-class shareholding companies from listing since the mid-1980s while the United States allows it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But after a lengthy debate, the Hong Kong government and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> now support the HKEX's listing reform plan allowing such companies to list, as the city wants to attract technology companies and compete with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, said on Tuesday the exchange will next month have a consultation on rule changes, including what investor protection measures should be introduced before dual-class shareholding companies can list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX has proposed that not all companies can be listed in such structures, and that it will allow only the very big technology companies to list with weighted voting rights. This will be conducted in a restricted fashion,” said Jonathan Lowe, the managing director of JPMorgan Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But I think some more additional safeguard measures will be needed.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities commission backs introduction of dual-class shares on Hong Kong stock exchange[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124972/securities-commission-backs-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronnie Lim Fook-yan, senior engagement specialist at Robeco Asia-Pacific, said the exchange should require dual-class shareholding companies to adopt equal voting rights for all types of shareholders in the situation of voting independent shareholders, so as to ensure these directors can represent minority shareholders' interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ‘one share, one vote' principle should also be adopted in approving related party transactions, he said. “There should be a clear disclosure about the special shareholding structure in the IPO prospectus. It is also important to educate investors to understand about their rights and risks in investing in these companies,” he said.We will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list hereSally Wong, chief executive, Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christine Chow Sheung-yi, the associate director of Hermes Investment Management, said all shareholders should be given the right to vote at the annual general shareholder meeting to decide if the dual-class shareholding structure should continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said a key reason for allowing such a structure is to allow founders to keep their corporate vision for the long term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, dual-class shareholding structures should not be a default but the founders and management have to work hard to earn them. It should allow all shareholders to judge if they have carried out the corporate vision well enough to achieve the benefit of the company, and to translate the founders' vision to become the corporate vision,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HSI Services, which compiles the Hang Seng Index, this week started a two-month consultation on whether dual-class shareholding companies should be included in the benchmark index, as passive investments will need to buy into these stocks if they are constituent stocks of the index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s Lowe said unless there was an extreme case, such as Snap, which allows its founders to have all voting rights while other shareholders have none, he believes other dual-class shareholding companies with reasonable governance could be included in the index.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More than half of the respondents believed the key risks in dual-class listings included insufficient minority or investor protection, as well as skewed proportionality between ownership and control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lack of widespread experience is of particular importance for investors in Asia, as the introduction of dual-class shares to Hong Kong and Singapore in the first half of this year could lead to a race to the bottom as other exchanges in the region contemplate a similar move, said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy, Asia Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA institute</span><span class="s1">. She said the singlemost important safeguard is a mandatory time-based sunset on dual-class shares structures of not more than five years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing rule, which allows dual-class share companies to go public, does not have a "sunset clause," but this does not mean weighted voting rights will exist forever, according to the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Henry Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If shareholders with weighted voting rights died, or were no longer the directors of a company, then their voting rights would end, Lau wrote in this blog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors worry that if dual-class shares are included into major stock indexes, they will have no choices but to buy them. Lau, however, said that major indexes companies have looked into this issue.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, Hong Kong's stock market industry watchdog, will not be taking a front-row seat in new listing approvals, meaning the city can now push ahead with plans to launch a new market for dual-class shares in an effort top lure technology companies in particular to list here, according to brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The retreat by the SFC from taking a frontline role in approving new listings means HKEX (</span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">) and the listing committee can continue to share the task," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a local broker who is also the lawmaker representing the sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is positive for the HKEX, allowing it to push ahead with another reform later, aimed at attracting more dual-class technology giants to list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class stock structure allows the issuing of various types of shares by a single company, where the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two share classes are typically issued: one share class is offered to the general public, and the other is offered to company founders, executives and family.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to sources close to the matter, the SFC and HKEX are now set to unveil what commentators see as a watered-down conclusion to their five-month long consultation, with the SFC agreeing to back off from its desired front-line role in new listings approving, with the HKEX maintaining its primary role.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is, however, to be represented on a new committee to formulate listing policies, but would not be able to appraise the performance of HKEX's listing staff, the sources told South China Morning Post on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog backs away from front-seat role in Hong Kong's stock listing process[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2111050/securities-watchdog-backs-away-front-seat-role-hong-kongs-stock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC's retreat is obviously related to strong opposition from all sectors to its reform plans, with many worried that an upgraded role in approvals would have had a negative affect on the number of new listings," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With the SFC now willing to compromise on listing reform, it is likely to be more open minded on allowing dual-class shares companies to list in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's two years since HKEX proposed allowing dual-class share listing in Hong Kong, which the SFC immediately opposed, fearing such a structure would be unfair to investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shares are still not allowed in Hong Kong, but the US does allow them, a factor which is largely credited with mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba's opting for Wall Street instead of Hong Kong to list in 2014. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global equity strategist Christopher Wood said rejecting duel-listing in Hong Kong would be "stupid" and lead to lost future listing opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the key in future will be disclosure, and that as long as the dual-class shares companies were open about their shareholder structure, it would be up to investors to decide if they want to buy or walk away from an investment.The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpracticeJoseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX last month completed a two-month consultation into the launch of a new third board to allow dual-class share structure companies, and make it easier for start-ups to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform is expected to need a second consultation later this year. If it again gains strong support, the new board could be launched next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung, however, maintains that dual-class shares could still be allowed to list on the main board instead of being forced to choose the new board. But he would not oppose market participants wanting to list on a new board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities, believes the SFC will continue to use enforcement action to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The compromise by the SFC avoids the market becoming over-regulated, but the commission is expected to continue to take enforcement action to crack down on market malpractice, if needed."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mike Wong Ming-wai, chief executive of the Chamber of Listed Companies of Hong Kong, said he was glad the SFC had retreated from its proposed plan to become directly involved in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We still worry, however, there may be over-regulation in the market if the SFC goes ahead with its proposal to set up a new committee involving its representatives in setting listing policies," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC may still have an important influence on this committee and hence a tight curb on the new listing policies. We want to see Hong Kong remain a market that has listing rules friendly to all market players, instead of one which is regulatory led."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is Hong Kong's rival, and not Shanghai or Shenzhen, when it comes to attracting “unicorns”, according to Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Asian stock exchanges are vying with each other to change listing rules in a bid to attract new economy companies and dual-class shareholding structure firms to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen have never been competitors of Hong Kong as we always cooperate with each other. Tong said on the sidelines of a regulatory forum on Wednesday. “Rather, Singapore is a competitor of Hong Kong,” adding that if dual-class shareholding companies were to list in Hong Kong and in the mainland, it would be a win-win situation for both.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) last month said it would bring forward its listing reform by several months, with its one-month long consultation due to end on March 23. Thereafter it plans to change the rules which will take effect in late April and start accepting listing applications of dual-class shares companies and biotech giant without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend that they had prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting unicorns - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and had already visited a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, chairman of </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)</span><span class="s1">, the mainland's top markets watchdog, confirmed last week that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC's Tong said Hong Kong's stock market will not be affected by China's plans to attract new economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong cooperates with mainland stock markets but we are very independent,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, owner of theSouth China Morning Post, chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structure allows shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian stock exchanges previously opposed such companies to list because it goes against the “one share one vote” principle. But now several exchanges are speeding up their reforms to explicitly allow dual-class shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of SFC, said at the same forum that the commission found shortcomings in the works of 31 financial firms that acted as listing sponsors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some listing sponsors did not fulfil their duty with regards to due diligence on the companies they sponsored, falling short of the SFC requirements,” she said, adding the commission will issue a report on the matter soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She also said the commission plans to study some brokers' demand to use WhatApp to take customer orders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Singapore maintained their high ranks in a report on corporate governance published on Wednesday, but a decision to allow listings by dual-class shareholding companies has eroded their edge over other jurisdictions in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report was presented by brokerage CLSA and non-profit organisation Asia Corporate Governance Association. The association ranked Hong Kong second in the region, with a score of 60 in its biennial survey, followed by 59 for Singapore in third position. CLSA, on the other hand, ranked Singapore second with 70.1 points, Japan third with 66.7 points and Hong Kong fourth with 66.3 points. Australia topped the rankings in both cases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2016, the non-profit ranked Singapore second and Hong Kong third, while CLSA ranked the Lion City third and the special administrative region fourth, behind Japan and Australia in second and first places, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threat to that fundamental driver [of better corporate governance],” the association and CLSA said in their joint report. While a belief "in the value of transparency and accountability remains largely intact, the third principle, fairness, has come under fire”, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shareholders with dual-class shares have different voting rights. Through this structure - popular among emerging companies and industries - founding shareholders or key management with minority ownership can still retain control over company board directors and major decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has allowed companies with dual-class shares to list since April this year; Singapore followed in June, in the face of competition from exchanges in the United States that have long allowed such listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only two mainland China companies with dual-class shareholding structures have listed in Hong Kong so far: Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone supplier; and food delivery service platform </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Yonts, head of environment, social and governance and power research at CLSA, a joint sponsor of Xiaomi's US$4.72 billion initial public offering this year, said its analysts had "marked down” Xiaomi on "fairness” when giving it a score, which was "in line” with the average score given to mainland Chinese companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asia Corporate Governance Association, said Hong Kong and Singapore's lead over other Asian markets would have been three to four points higher, had they not allowed dual-class share listings.The introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong and Singapore highlights a threatCLSA, Asia Corporate Governance Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he believed the two cities would be able to maintain their edge, as there was no sign yet that lower ranked but close rivals Malaysia and Taiwan would follow suit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But the problem in Malaysia is, if they start losing some of their technology companies to Singapore, Hong Kong or the US, then clearly there will be pressure on them. It really depends on what happens in the next six to 12 months, in terms of where some of their companies choose to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said he was worried that a "contagion” had already started, and gave the example of South Korea signalling this year an interest in allowing small businesses and venture start-ups to issue dual-class shares, to encourage more small technology companies to list on the Kosdaq second board market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was ranked by the association on the basis of "original and independent research”, with no input from outside respondents to 121 questions it designed to assess a country's corporate governance. The questions cover government policies, regulatory rules and enforcement, investors' participation in corporate governance and corporate audit standards, besides society and media monitoring. The association also incorporated findings from an in-depth look at disclosure and governance practices of 25 large and mid-capitalisation stocks in each market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA, meanwhile, used a "bottom-up” approach by examining 1,100 listed companies' governance in the region.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said Hong Kong's move to set up an independent regulator for the audit industry next year is positive, but bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> had not gone far enough in its recent corporate governance code revamp, on issues including gender diversity and limits on the number of corporate boards individual directors are allowed to sit on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In mainland China, the trial of so-called mixed ownership in state companies - private and state capital - had yielded mixed results, said Allen. The reform would fare better on the governance front if private funds were allowed to invest in units spun off from state-owned enterprises, and appoint representatives in their independent new boards, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class shares listing rules must reform to protect investors and prevent an erosion of corporate governance, the </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of people think that because dual-class shares structures work in other jurisdictions it will immediately, effortlessly translate into an APAC context,” said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1">. "We are trying to challenge some of those preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's listing rules changed in April to allow companies with dual-class shares to float on the bourse, giving founders and key management stronger voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Western countries, including the US, have had such rules in place for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, Tokyo implemented the change in 2015 and Singapore in June, but no companies have listed so far in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has traditionally been defined by a "one-share, one-vote” system, meaning all shareholders enjoy proportional representation in company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Hong Kong could not offer </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> a dual-class structure was thought to be a strong reason the Chinese tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014, and was indicative of the city losing out as an IPO destination. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms - aimed at attracting tech companies who want to maximise valuation and see their founders' vision through - have drawn two of the city's biggest tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi raised HK$54 billion (US$4.7 billion), while in September Beijing-based online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised HK$52.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in a survey carried out by </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> in March this year, 97 per cent of their members in Asia-Pacific believed safeguards were needed to protect investors from a few controlling stakeholders, according to a report published on Tuesday, named "Dual-class Shares: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong already offers an "event-based sunset”, where founders' stronger voting rights collapse if they leave the company or transfer shares. But more is needed, argued CFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global association of investment professionals recommended a mandatory "time-based sunset” where super voting rights will collapse to regular shareholder voting rights after no longer than five years post-IPO, to protect investors from a lack of control in their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insufficient investor protection was noted by 53 per cent of respondents as a key risk of dual-class shares, while 52 per cent highlighted the skewed proportionality between ownership and control, and 28 per cent identified an erosion of corporate governance standards.The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountableMary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountable,” said Leung. "No matter what public shareholders want, there is a limitation to what they can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the structure may make sense at the time of IPO, we don't believe it should carry on forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> of 157 dual-class structure IPOs in the US since the early 2000s found companies with ongoing weighted voting rights and those that allowed collapsed super voting rights, had similar valuations in the first two years after floating. From the third year, however, companies with collapsed voting rights began trading at a higher valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CFA respondents were also worried about their lack of education on how to invest in companies with dual-class share structures. The survey founds 60 per cent said they had no experience investing in such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some argue we don't need rules as we are all grown ups, in Asia because there is so much retail investment in the market when things go wrong, they look to the regulators,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Are we set up in the right way to look after these people? Investors must of course do due diligence on what they are buying, but a great deal of work can be done to raise awareness and education levels.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li's FWD Group is considering listing in either Hong Kong or Singapore with a dual-class structure, after the Lion City's stock exchange followed the SAR's bourse in allowing dual-class listing last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FWD is discussing with advisers the merits of listing in Singapore using such a structure, which can offer enhanced voting power to protect the influence of founders and management, according to the people.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong-based company is also considering its home city as a potential listing venue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A listing of FWD, which manages more than US$26.6 billion (HK$208.78 billion) of assets, would be a coup for either of the exchanges as they both seek to grab a greater share of deals from competing financial centers. The duo recently allowed companies to list with dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No final decisions have been made, and there's no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, according to the sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FWD's backers include Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. Other investors include </span><span class="s3">Swiss Re</span><span class="s1">, the world's second-largest reinsurer, and Asian private equity firm RRJ Capital.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said yesterday it has agreed to work with China's bourses towards the inclusion of dual-class shares in a cross-border trading link, marking a step towards resolving a dispute on the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest statement from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> says dual-class shares will be subjected to an initial "special stability trading period," after which they could be included in the stock connect scheme that allows investors from China and Hong Kong to buy shares in each other's markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX did not define what it meant by stability nor how long dual-class shares - which give greater voting rights to company founders over individual investors - may have to wait for inclusion in stock connect. The bourse operator has set up a working group with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to address the issue "as soon as possible."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision marks a partial victory for HKEX Chief Executive Officer Charles Li, who flew to Beijing after Chinese exchanges surprised the market on Saturday when they said they would exclude companies like Xiaomi from the stock connect because investors didn't understand the risks associated with the new products. Permitting weighted-voting structures was the centerpiece of a years-long struggle to attract technology listings to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi (1810), the first, and so far only, firm to list with two classes of shares under Hong Kong's new listing rules, rose more than 6 percent on the news, after slumping on Monday, following the surprise announcement from two mainland exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Key details like the length of the new stability period, and who decides its length, are still unclear, but this announcement will at least calm things down," said Louis Tse, managing director of asset management at Hong Kong financial services firm VC Group.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan's deal is expected to raise more than HK$31.40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing reforms have come as the city jostles for the top global IPO venue crown with New York and China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Competition between the Hong Kong exchange and New York and mainland exchanges is inevitable, and the rule changes seem to be part of it," said Mike Suen, a partner at law firm Withers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't see this particular change, however, it ends up, as having too much effect on where companies decide to list. Inclusion in stock connect is normally a marginal factor in companies' decision," Suen added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government, along with HKEX and the SFC, say they will work together to make the city more attractive as a listing destination for new economy companies, adding momentum to the proposed new stock market for dual class shares after regulators embraced a water down version of listing reforms on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform should not be seen as a power struggle between the SFC and HKEX. The two regulators and the government all want to work together to upgrade the quality of Hong Kong markets and to see that the market operates more efficiently,” said James Lau, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of the listing reform package, the Securities and Futures Commission agreed to abandon its controversial proposal last year for a frontline role in approving new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central listing approval process will remain in the hands of HKEX and its listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC also agreed to abandon a proposal to review the performance of listing division staff. The responsibility will instead remain part of the purview of HKEX executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is not a climb down which is a wrong way to describe the conclusion. We are listening to comments and consider the current approach more effective,” said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The conclusion will clarify the roles of SFC and HKEX in vetting new listings. Many problems happen after companies get listed. This is why post-listing enforcement is important,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities watchdog's retreat on new share listings paves way for dual-class shares [http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2111201/securities-watchdogs-retreat-new-share-listings-paves-way]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC will retain its role in setting listing policies, while a 12 member advisory panel will support the listing committee in setting policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government and the SFC and the stock exchange are open minded to carefully study how to carry out reforms to make sure our market could attract new economies to list here while at the same time we protect the interest of investors,” Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The water downed listing reforms come after a five-month controversial consultation last year, which received 8,500 submissions from brokers, listed companies and financial professionals. Ninety-four per cent of respondents were against the proposed reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said the listing reform result was a blow to the SFC and a victory for the HKEX and would likely help pave way for the launch of a third board supporting dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015 the HKEX pushed for a consultation process on whether to launch dual class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections of the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August the HKEX completed a two month consultation on the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board was among the top agenda items at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in August, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are listed in the US under a dual class share structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange operator has scrapped a planned consultation to expand listing reforms that would allow corporate investors to own stakes in companies that have a so-called dual-class shares structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision is a further setback for the sweeping reforms, which have so far failed to generate the much hoped-for slew of applications from big technology firms eager to raise capital on the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange introduced new rules in April to allow companies with dual-class shareholding rights, or weighted voting rights, to list here. The reform allows individual founders or certain key executives of these companies to own shares that carry more voting rights than those of other shareholders. The move was aimed at attracting more technology companies, which tend to favour this structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) had said initially it would launch a separate consultation by July 31 on whether it should also allow companies to own the special voting-class shares. The bourse, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that this consultation would not be launched after all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said: “Given that the current weighted voting-rights regime has only recently been put in place, the exchange believes it should deliberate further the extended weighted voting-rights regime and should continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to develop a broader consensus on the subject matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the exchange has decided not to launch a corporate weighted voting-rights consultation at this time as initially planned. The exchange will update the market on the subject in due course.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief expects more IPOs under Hong Kong's new listing regime after summer break[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2146645/hkex-chief-expects-more-ipos-under-hong-kongs-new-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marks another setback for the biggest overhaul of the local bourse's listing rules in 25 years, which was carried out amid high hopes that it would attract technology giants with dual-class shares as well as biotech firms that are yet to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Almost three months on, only two companies with the dual-class shareholding structure - smartphone maker Xiaomi and online food-delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> - have applied for listing. Hangzhou-based </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in mainland China, is the only pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing, and is set to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is somewhat disappointing,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector. “We would like to see the HKEX continue its listing reform to accept diversified companies to list, including those with different shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it may be a good move to slow down the pace to allow more parties to discuss further on the reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiaomi's recent IPO not living up to its expectations of raising US$10 billion and some Chinese tech firms opting to float their shares in the US and Shanghai, Hong Kong could only maintain its No 3 global IPO ranking in the first half, unchanged from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong retail investors give Xiaomi's IPO the cold shoulder, put off by high financing cost and valuation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced earlier this month they would not allow dual-class shareholding companies listed in Hong Kong to be traded by mainlanders via the stock connect schemes, a further blow to the effectiveness of the listing reforms. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiao-jia flew to Beijing last week to negotiate, and the three bourses agreed to look at when dual-class companies might be allowed to trade via the stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, supported the HKEX decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The dual-class shareholding listing reform was only launched three months ago. The market participants and investors still need time to digest the reform. It would be too soon to launch another consultation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX would be better off focusing on working with the mainland regulators to sort out the issue of mainlanders being able to trade the dual-class shares via the stock connect. That would be more important than making further changes to the listing reform.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore's effort to score the 2018 listing of state oil giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> - expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering - is the latest show of its ambition to develop an elite global exchange, but analysts say a lack of liquidity in the Lion City should mean Hong Kong will hold firm as Asia's top bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fierce courtship of Aramco has brought into focus how the region's exchanges are dangling new carrots to attract multibillion-dollar listings that have dried up since the US$25 billion IPO of Alibaba in 2014 - the largest to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One incentive being considered in Singapore and Hong Kong is an easing of the one-share, one-vote orthodoxy in order to accommodate technology companies that prefer dual-class share structures in which the different classes have distinct voting rights and dividend payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco, which is planning an initial listing of just five per cent of its equity in 2018, has so far not shown an interest in dual-class shares, but Singapore is offering other sweeteners. These include the possibility that GIC, one of the city state's two sovereign wealth funds, could become a cornerstone investor. On February 2, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom was considering concurrent listings of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With its estimated oil reserves of 265 billion barrels - or 15 per cent of the world's proven reserves - the company is expected to be valued at around US$2 trillion. A five per cent flotation would raise US$100 billion, four times the amount raised by Alibaba, the owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco's share offer is the centrepiece of the influential Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's strategy to attract foreign investment and wean the country off its dependence on oil revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market observers said the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX), the city state's sole stock market operator, would be looking to differentiate itself from the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (NYSE) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) by touting the island nation's neutral stance in geopolitics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US President Donald Trump's erratic Middle East foreign policy, coupled with legislation passed last year that allows victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, are seen in some quarters as factors that could deter Aramco from listing on the NYSE. With Hong Kong, questions remain over the extent of the city's legal autonomy from Beijing, experts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The biggest case for Singapore to woo Aramco would be that it is a truly neutral ground compared to everywhere else,” said Song Seng Wun, a Singapore-based economist with CIMB Private Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On purely market-based factors, however, the Singapore exchange is unlikely to upstage its bigger counterpart in Hong Kong any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average daily value of shares traded in the Lion City in January was S$1.05 billion (HK$5.74 billion), about a 10th of the HK$57.2 billion worth of shares traded in Hong Kong over the same period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total market capitalisation of SGX in 2016 was S$926 billion (HK$5.06 trillion), compared with HK$24.8 trillion in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore is just a smaller, niche market with limited liquidity compared to Hong Kong,” said Song, the Singapore-based economist.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eddie Wong, partner of capital markets services at PwC in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong had an advantage over its regional rivals because of its deep ties with the Chinese mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People [on the mainland] like doing deals in a familiar place and with people they know,” Wong said. Apart from mainland Chinese firms, South Asian companies were also increasingly showing interest in being listed in Hong Kong, Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An endemic lack of liquidity and the difficulty in luring Chinese IPOs away from Hong Kong are just two of several obstacles the SGX is facing. Its ambition of being an “Asian Gateway” is increasingly under threat by the rising stature of other Southeast Asian bourses like the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the </span><span class="s3">Indonesia Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, and Malaysia's Bursa Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite falling global deal volumes, Asian exchanges are likely to see an uptick in flotations as “it is relatively early days for many of the equity markets in Asia including mainland China and many Southeast Asian markets,” said David Erickson, the former co-head of global equity markets at </span><span class="s3">Barclays</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ace up Singaporean stock market regulators' sleeves could be the introduction of dual class shares before the city's rivals. Technology start-ups have shown a preference for such tiered stocks, but critics charge that they give founders outsized control cheaply and disadvantage minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on Alibaba's IPO because the Chinese e-commerce giant was adamant on a tiered share structure that the city's rules do not permit. SGX was edged out by the NYSE for the 2012 IPO of English football giant </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> for the same reason. The city state has not had a multibillion-dollar IPO since the 2011 listing of </span><span class="s3">Hutchison Port Holdings Trust</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye in January said the exchange would soon launch a public consultation on permitting dual class shares. HKEX chief Li Xiaojia, meanwhile, has said the exchange will launch a similar exercise. The Hong Kong had plans to relaunch dual class shares in 2015 (they have been banned in the city since 1989) but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> shot down the idea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If Singapore goes ahead with the plan, I am afraid it will be a race to the bottom. Hong Kong will not be able to resist the political pressure to [introduce dual-class shares] and both markets will hurt themselves,” said Jamie Allen, the Hong Kong-based secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. “It goes against the principle of fairness...dual-class structures are unfair to minority shareholders,” said Allen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuck Seng Tham, capital markets leader at PwC in Singapore, said risks associated with tiered share structures could be “properly managed instead of avoided, with the appropriate safeguards”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said Singapore and Hong Kong were unlikely to make a decision on dual-class shares by the end of this year. ■</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies chairman, Francis Leung Pak-to, also known as “father of red chips” said on Monday that the chamber supported the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed separate board to list dual class share companies here, but not new start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has just ended a consultation last Friday for the third board's establishment, whose listing requirements differ from the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market, essentially aimed at providing a listing venue for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have two platforms: a premium market that is open to all investors and will host companies that are eligible to list on the main board, but have a dual-class share structure which the exchange currently disallows. The second is for start-ups where only professional investors can invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung was opposed to the start-up board for the high risks that entailed. “Many start-ups lack track records and have a high risk of failure. They are not suitable to be traded on the stock exchange,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He supported however, the launch of a separate board only for the dual class shares with a market capitalisation of HK$8 billion, which is similar to a so-called unicorn new economy firm valued at US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list here,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are plenty of mainland “unicorns” which would be interested to list in Hong Kong, but our market needs to prepare itself for these companies. This is why we would need this new board that accept dual class share companies to list,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many big technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> are dual class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than the others. Hong Kong bans such types of companies to list but US allows it, which has led mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba to go for a listing in New York in 2014, instead of Hong Kong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.We need to set the bar high to attract the most successful and the biggest technology and new economy firms to list hereFrancis Leung Pak-to, Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Three years after losing Alibaba and our market still has done nothing to address the issue. We need to make sure our market can capture these companies to list. This is why we need to introduce the third board soon,” Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When I introduced the red chips in Hong Kong in the 1990s, there were many criticisms that these companies are different from other H-shares. But then, we have many successful listings - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">CNOOC</span><span class="s1">, Citic, </span><span class="s3">China Resources</span><span class="s1"> - and they are still heavily traded by investors,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A red chip is a company incorporated in Hong Kong but has a mainland parent, which is different from an H-share company which is established in the mainland but listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is also against the HKEX's proposal to let US-listed mainland companies seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This rule will turn Hong Kong into a second-tier market as most big players will go list in the US and then seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. We oppose to this proposal,” Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> has opposed to dual class share listings as they reduce the ability for fund managers to exercise their voting rights to decide on the remuneration, director appointments and other important corporate affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund body said the development of dual class shares were “negative” to investor protection and urged the exchange to stick to “one share, one vote” principle.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange said it will explore ways to encourage start-ups and technology companies to raise capital in the city, conceding the need to tweak existing listing rules to compete with Singapore and New York to be the hub for initial stock offers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We will study all possibilities and whether we should adopt a new disclosure regime for these new markets,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388%20&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], at a luncheon with more than 100 of the city's brokers and fund managers.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the listing advisory committee at rival </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> approved a plan to allow companies with dual-class shares to raise funds, in a move that makes the city more appealing to technology start-ups that often feature stocks with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class structure has been the subject of intense debate in Hong Kong since the bourse in 2014 missed out on a US$25 billion initial public offer by </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, owner of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has a dual-class structure that allows founding shareholders to nominate up to half the company's board of directors even as they own minority shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong hasn't allowed such a structure since the 1980s because the city's Securities &amp; Futures Commission, the market regulator, believes dual-class shares violate the “one share, one vote” principle and are unfair to other investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba eventually listed its shares in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US stock market allows dual-class shares, favoured by technology companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">LinkedIn</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the world's largest destination for IPOs from 2009 to 2011, but lost that pole position to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2014, due to Alibaba's listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of the 30 mainland Chinese companies listed in the US, 29 had dual-class structures</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addressing the annual gathering of stockbrokers, Li neither specifically addressed the subject of allowing dual-class structure in Hong Kong, nor bring up competition with Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have our own plan and our own strategies and we will explore all possibilities,” he said. “Other stock exchanges do their own thing and we will not respond to what another exchange is doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At stake for Hong Kong could be another large stock offer by other startups including Alibaba's online payments unit </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, which investment bankers estimate could be valued as much as US$50 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's founder Ma told the University of Macau students in June that he “very much hopes” to list </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which operates the Alipay electronic payments platform, in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in his blog that Hong Kong should allow dual-class shares companies to go public as the SAR is expected to adjust the framework of the financial market to cater to the needs of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Compared with the wave of technology in 2000, the development of technology nowadays has been further changing the economic structure as well as consuming behavior, he said, adding that the new economy plays an important role in the global financial market, as the top 10 companies in the world in terms of market value consist of many new economy companies, including Apple, Alphabet and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Chan said the SAR is still based on traditional economy, with financial and property industries accounting for about 44 percent of the stock market. Many fast-growing industries such as biotechnology and pharmacy have a low proportion, around 1 percent, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said it is unavoidable that start-ups raise money from the public. Founders of these companies want to maintain control after raising capital from the public so they prefer to debut with dual-class shares. For instance, Chan said Alphabet and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> all trade their shares with a dual-share structure in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) will provide a summary of the public consultation on the proposed new board which started earlier this year. Together with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, the bourse will introduce a new round of consultation on further revising the listing rules.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should not lift a ban on dual-class shareholding structure in order to lure new listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Chow Kuang-fai, chairman of the Hong Kong chapter of the </span><span class="s3">Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</span><span class="s1">, said local rules on shareholding structure do not lag global standards, and they are effective and in line with international regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fears have been expressed that failure to ease the ban on dual-class shareholding could deter yet another mainland technology giant, such as handset maker Xiaomi, from listing in Hong Kong in the same manner as Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's largest e-commerce giant eventually listed in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``If some companies fail to match up with the local system, they cannot be listed in the SAR,'' Chow said. He believes discussions on shareholding structure is necessary, but a new system may not be the best option if it is seen as unfair. Chow urged local regulators to also pay more attention to bitcoins and boost investor protection as no government has officially accepted the online payment system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">UBS managing director Pu Yonghao said the invention of bitcoins reflects market concerns about major currencies, but liquidity and supervision of the bitcoin itself remains in doubt. He expects China to cut interest rates in March and its GDP growth to slip to 6.8 percent this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PwC expects Hong Kong to be the world's largest IPO market in 2018 with expected fundraising of up to HK$250 billion, supported by rescheduled mega-sized IPOs from 2017 and the proposed dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm said the proposed dual-class share structures will help the Hong Kong market to attract new-economy enterprises to come to Hong Kong for fundraising and enhance the diversification of its capital market. If all goes to plan, the first IPO under the new dual-class structure is expected to be in the second half of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benson Wong, entrepreneur group leader at PwC Hong Kong, is confident Hong Kong will continue to be the best financing platform in the region for bringing together international investors and mainland enterprises as the success of Stock Connect initiatives has diversified the SAR's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the full H-Share convertibility pilot scheme could bolster fundraising activities, together with the upcoming new-economy enterprise IPOs activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Excalibur Global, a futures brokerage services provider which will debut on January 12, said the 47 percent year-on-year drop in its interim 2017 revenue was affected by low investment sentiment but it recorded rebounded earnings from July to October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The group opened its retail book last Friday and expects to raise net proceeds of up to HK$85 million by offering 200 million shares priced from HK$0.375 to HK$0.425. Investors will pay HK$3434.26 for a board lot of 8,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Restaurant operator Taste Gourmet, which will begin trading on January 15, said eight new restaurants will be opened in the next three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company expects to raise up to HK$109 million by issuing 100 million shares at a price range of HK$0.86 to HK$1.09. A board lot costs HK$4403.9 for 4,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ophthalmic company CMer Eye, which opened its retail book last Friday, has brought in former chairman of Esprit Michael Ying Lee-yuen and Tencent Pony Ma Hua Teng as investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company expects to raise up to HK$571 million by offering 197 million shares at a price range of HK$2.35 to HK$2.9. A board lot costs HK$5858.45 for 2,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds raised will be used to open six new hospitals in 2018 and 2019 with a focus on the mainland as the company said Hong Kong was a very mature market and it sees a larger market in China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With big Chinese technology and internet initial public offerings potentially in the pipeline, Hong Kong's decision to revamp its IPO rules could tip the balance in its favour as it battles for China listings with New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Companies are increasingly more positive on Hong Kong as a preferred listing destination,” said Mervyn Chow, the co-head of investment banking and capital markets, Asia-Pacific, and Greater China chief executive at Credit Suisse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said on Friday it would propose rule changes to allow dual-class shares on the main board, with a formal public consultation to be launched as early as the first quarter of 2018. The overhaul in listing regulations could be the city's most drastic in three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rule changes to allow dual-class shares will enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness vis-a- vis the US, especially for Chinese technology IPOs. It is the right timing for Hong Kong to make these changes. It will be a game changer,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why does Hong Kong need dual-class stocks, with tech IPOs aplenty? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124799/why-did-hong-kong-replace-our-one-share-one-vote-principle-dual]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a group of rapidly expanding Chinese technology and internet companies nears the stage of going public, the battle for big Chinese listings has intensified between Hong Kong and its fundraising rivals, such as New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the privately owned Chinese smartphone maker, has been in talks with investment banks for a possible IPO as soon as next year, which might value the company at more than US$50 billion, versus a valuation of US$46 billion at its most recent funding round in 2014, according to media reports. Either Hong Kong or New York could host the listing, the reports said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong refits listing rules in race with New York for IPO crown [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124503/hong-kong-overhauls-citys-stock-listing-rules-attract-biotech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If valued at US$50 billion, Xiaomi's float will be the third-largest technology IPO in history, surpassing Snap's US$24 billion listing in March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> , which owns the South China Morning Post, and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> rank No. 1 and No. 2, with valuations of US$167 billion and US$104 billion, respectively, when they were listed in 2014 and 2012 in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Tencent Music, the music streaming unit of </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> , has also invited investment banks to handle its planned listing next year, which could value the unit at US$10 billion, Bloomberg reported recently, citing unnamed sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has already seen a flurry of fundraising in 2017 by technology and internet companies, with five of its 10 largest IPOs by companies operating in the new economy, compared with none last year. Listings by banks and securities companies, staples of Hong Kong's capital market, have halved to 30 per cent of this year's top IPOs, from 60 per cent last year, in line with regulators' goals to draw more new economy companies to float here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, Tencent's China Literature debuted on the Hong Kong market, and its US$1.06 billion IPO attracted overwhelming investor demand, in what was the hottest listing in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other potential technology IPOs in the forthcoming year could include: </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) Company of China's peer-to-peer online-lending platform Lufax, which could raise up to US$5 billion in a planned Hong Kong IPO as soon as the first half of 2018; its Chinese rival Dianrong.com, backed by Singapore's GIC, which is also considering a Hong Kong listing to raise least US$500 million; as well as Hong Kong's online finance lending platform WeLab, with a possible listing size of US$500 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Baidu's video streaming site </span><span class="s3">iQiyi</span><span class="s1"> is targeting an IPO as soon as next year, to value it at up to US$10 billion, with New York a possible listing destination, according to reports this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is Hong Kong's IPO fever over after Nissin and Shandong Trust fail to excite? [http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> , the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> fintech affiliate that operates Alipay, has delayed its IPO. Jack Ma Yun , the Alibaba chairman, said last month he would possibly consider an IPO for </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> in two years, but not in the next 12 to 18 months. The venue for this listing is also undecided. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> was valued at US$60 billion in its last funding round in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> 's Chow said Chinese issuers usually prefer a Hong Kong listing, as it is closer to their home market and enables access to a larger pool of international as well as mainland investors, who typically have a good understanding of the business models and the products that tend to be relevant locally. “This has been important for Chinese technology firms, which are largely ‘product companies' focused on building and selling products to consumers.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the proposed move to a dual-class share structure, more innovative companies might choose Hong Kong as a listing destination. Moreover, the changes might bring new opportunities for investors, which would boost the liquidity of the city's capital market, Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These opportunities include new IPO products, such as potentially a trading link to enable mainland investors to buy into Hong Kong IPOs.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital, said he had already seen a rising willingness among his clients in China to favour Hong Kong as an IPO destination. Wan said he expected the first dual-class share company to appear on the Hong Kong market as early as the second half of 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This year we've had several hot tech IPOs, such as ZhongAn Online, China Literature and Razer, which have ignited investors' enthusiasm towards new-economy stocks and raised expectations about more tech and internet listings coming to Hong Kong, such as the highly anticipated IPOs of Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> ,” said Kenny Shui, a senior researcher at Our Hong Kong Foundation, a Hong Kong-based think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a key issue would be how Hong Kong can protect retail investors at the same time, as dual-class shares give company founders much more power over their business even if they hold a small portion of the shares, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have had a number of pre-IPO enquiries relating to the new listing regime,” said an HKEX spokeswoman.“We expect potential issuers and their consultants will file formal applications in due course.The listing regime is a standing facility and potential issuers don't need to rush to file applications on the first day.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following a reform announced last Tuesday, after many rounds of consultations held over four years, the HKEX now allows technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology companies with no revenue to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are still a lot of challenges to implementing this reform. Obviously, we are facing a lot of competition from other markets for listings by technology companies,” Laura Cha Shih May-lung, the newly elected chairwoman of HKEX, said on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government has signalled that it intends to drop a plan to establish a new board on the city's stock exchange for start-ups and companies with multiple-class shareholding structures to raise capital, choosing instead to amend existing rules to allow these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is likely reach a consensus with the Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SEC) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) in the next few weeks, and publish a conclusion of the public consultations that have taken place over the proposed new board, said James Lau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have looked at both possibilities” of whether to introduce so-called weighted voting rights, or multiple-class structure, on the proposed board or the main board, Lau said. “The chance is higher on the main board.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The unexpected comment is the first sign that the Hong Kong government, years after agonising over how best to retain and attract so-called new economy companies to raise capital in Asia's largest destination for initial public offers, is now preparing to step away from the plan. What changed was the successful IPO last month by Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$1.5 billion on the city's stock exchange, even as its profit track record didn't meet the main board's requirement of a combined profit of HK$50 million in the three years before listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's market ranked third among global destinations for IPOs in the first three quarters of this year, with 106 companies raising a combined HK$85 billion in the city, according to Deloitte's data. That compares with the whole of last year, when 71 IPOs raised HK$134.3 billion (US$17.2 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's brokers, bankers and regulators had been divided over how best to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> -- the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post -- abandon the local bourse to stage its record US$25 billion IPO in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue was a voting structure among the company's founding shareholders that gave them veto power over the appointment of directors, a special right that contravenes Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle. Ever since, Hong Kong had been debating whether to allow companies with dual-class shares, a common feature among technology companies from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> to Snapchat, to list on the exchange, or establish a new board to cater for them. The New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> bourses allow these dual-class stocks to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/2aca847a-b7ed-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_image_hires_203112.JPG]In June, HKEX proposed to set up a new board, or so-called “Third Board”, as part of its broader market reform. The new board will permit dual-class shares, a structure designed to give specific shareholders more voting power than others. Shares in one class carry one vote, while shares in another carry multiple votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over these past few years, we have all observed a better trend in the development of this particular sector and do have a better grasp of the future direction,” Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said today during a taxation forum. “So under different sets of circumstances now, if we can have a proper safeguard design and have them put in place, allowing companies with weighted corporate structures to be listed is not impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move has been regarded as part of the exchange's efforts to woo more technology and emerging companies amid growing competition for initial public offerings among global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal's public consultations ended last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, media reports said HKEX plans to highlight four points in the conclusion of public consultations, which could pave the way for a potential next round of consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four points include supporting the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, making rule changes to the main board instead of setting up a new board, scrapping the establishment of a new listing segment targeting tech start-ups, and adding new rules to attract emerging companies such as biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, the HKEX proposed to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with multiple classes of shares among their shareholders may be allowed to raise capital in Hong Kong by the middle of 2018, as the city's Securities&amp;Futures Commission (SFC) backs away from its position on the "One Share, One Vote" principle, which has been a pillar of the local capital market since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A pilot scheme will be launched next year, whereby certain start-up companies that have attained the so-called unicorn status - valuations exceeding US$1 billion - will be allowed to raise capital on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange through initial public offerings, if they put in place sufficient investor protection provisions, two sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The protection provisions may include a sunset clause that compels the companies to set an expiry time, or conditions, for the different classes in their shareholding structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stocks listed under this pilot programme will also need to be designated with a special code to distinguish them from other listed companies, for reminding investors to be aware of potential risks, the source said. The pilot plan could be widened if sufficient number of high-quality companies are attracted to Hong Kong without regulatory problems, the sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's about-turn is a major step forward in helping Hong Kong compete with global capital markets including New York, Singapore and Shanghai, especially in attracting technology and new economy companies to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost its crown as the world's favoured destination for companies to raise funds this year, falling behind New York and Shanghai. Between January and June, the city's stock market raised US$5.8 billion worth of IPOs, a drop of 19.5 per cent from the US$7.3 billion it raised in the same period in 2016, when it was ranked as the leader for new listings worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> pushed for a consultation to launch dual-class shares in Hong Kong but the plan was scrapped due to objections by the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This came after the SFC in 2014 opposed exemption for </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which has a dual-class structure, to list in Hong Kong. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in what became the largest IPO in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source said the SFC was supporting Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who in August signalled the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets to attract more technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC and the government also want to see dual-class shares listed on the main board instead of a proposed separate board, as they do not want to see a fragmented market structure, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange is likely to announce the pilot scheme in the coming weeks, the second source said. It will hold a second round of detailed rule changes for this pilot scheme before dual-class shares can be listed in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may amend its listing rules to accept companies with dual class shares and biotech companies with no revenue as early as late April, accelerating the timeline for the widely-expected listing regime change by several months, the bourse operator said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January predicted the listing rules could be amended from June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We bring the reform forward to late April as it would allow the listing of these companies in the summer period when June to August are active months,” Li said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have discussed this reform for a long time and a lot of issues have consensus already. We do not need the normal two months of consultation and could speed the process up.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange on Friday issued a consultation paper detailing the proposed rule changes that will enable some companies with multiple-class share structures to list on the Hong Kong stock market, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation will last for one month, officially drawing to a close on March 23, while the consultation conclusion would be made in late April, officials said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Upon the issuance of the consultation conclusion and the implementation of the listing rules, the exchange will accept formal applications under the new regime,” the exchange said. Companies are welcome to make informal inquiries to the exchange ahead of the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few months we have collectively decided to take a big step forwards as a financial centre and welcome emerging and innovative companies. Now we are proposing a listing regime that will boost Hong Kong's attractiveness for a new generation of companies as well as investors, bringing more dynamism to our stock market,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, said he supported the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The proposals are reasonable and can offer shareholder protection. It is particularly important that biotech companies must not change their principal business without prior approval by the exchange,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year the HKEX, following an industry consultation, decided to proceed with reforms to allow dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong, as long as the companies have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$10 billion (US$1.29 billion) and annual revenue of HK$1 billion. Companies that have a market capitalisation of at least HK$40 billion would be exempt from the revenue requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our new secondary listing regime welcome both Chinese and international companies to apply,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies already listed under the dual-class share structure such as </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> or Baidu in the US, could apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong while maintaining their current structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If their share trading volume exceeds 55 per cent in Hong Kong, they could be classed as a dual primary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech companies taking advantage of the new listing regime would need to have a minimum market cap of HK$1.5 billion and be limited to sophisticated investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the exchange did not accept calls made by some fund managers for a sunset clause that would see the dual class structure expire after a period of years, or undergo a general vote by shareholders for renewal. The exchange said the rule would be too restrictive and prompt companies to look towards other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A sunset clause with an expiry date would create uncertainty for both companies and investors. It would be difficult for the companies to have long term development,” Li said. “It is also hard to determine what time frame would be appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among safeguards to protect minority investors, some shareholder votes would be conducted on the basis of one share one vote. This would apply to issues involving the appointment and removal of independent directors and auditors, changes to constitutional documents, changes to the rights of any class of shares, and the winding up of the company, the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual class shares will have a “W” stock marker while biotech firms will have a “B” at the end of their share name to help investors identify their features.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is up for another round of market reform as the stock exchange will solicit views from the public at the end of the month for a new board to allow more technology firms like Alipay and Lufax, as well as foreign giant companies such as </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stock exchange is at the final stage of preparation in the details of this new board. We hope to have the consultation about launching this new board by the end of May,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=388&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which runs the stock and futures exchanges in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the sideline of the </span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1"> Week Asia forum on Wednesday, Li said they were keen to have a bigger variety of companies to list here, including </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO that is expected to raise US$100 billion, in a 5 per cent stake sale of the oil giant valued at US$2 trillion. Hong Kong is in the running for the listing, but is facing competition from London and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new market which brokers call the third board, will be the third market in Hong Kong after the Main Board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said in January that the new board would have different listing rules from the other two markets to allow more foreign firms, infrastructure firms, overseas companies on the “Belt and Road Initiative”, technology or new-economy companies, and firms that want to be listed in a dual-class shareholding structure, to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX rekindles plans for dual-class share structure in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2063569/hkex-rekindles-plans-dual-class-share-structure-city]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be a good idea for the HKEX to launch a new board to attract more technology firms to list. Hong Kong has many big banks and financial giants to list, but we have too few technology companies listings here,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents the financial services sector, and is himself a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firms. This would be better than changing the rules for the main board and the GEM,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheung however, said the consultation needed to also offer suggestions to safeguard the interests of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We also want the HKEX to have good communication with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, for the regulator to support the reform. We do not want to repeat the chaos two years ago when the stock exchange proposed rule change on dual shareholding structure, and the plan was rejected by the SFC immediately,” he said.A new third board would allow the exchange to introduce a whole new set of listing rules, which could be more flexible listing requirements tailoring to the needs of technology and new-economy firmsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many new-economy companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares with a dual-share structure as their founders tend to hold on to a minority stake but want to retain control. Dual-share structures allow certain shareholders to have more voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list in New York over Hong Kong in 2014, as the SFC considers its shareholding structure to be a dual-class shareholding that is banned in Hong Kong but allowed in the US. Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has called Hong Kong listing rules outdated, that they do not meet the needs of new-economy companies. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pain of Alibaba loss prompts HKEX to examine new measures[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2012339/pain-alibaba-loss-prompts-hkex-examine-new-measures]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - payment arm of a unit of Alibaba - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> are both considering to list to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the plan a week later.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This time would be different as the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing last month said the commission had agreed to a consultation on the third board, including the dual-class share proposal. The change in attitude was because the type of listings would be limited to the new board, while the previous proposal applied to the entire market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, HKEX would face an uphill battle to convince all stakeholders to accept the dual-class shareholding structure. Many fund mangers such as </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="s1"> and Templeton Franklin are opposed to it as they consider the structure unfair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be good to have a new market in Hong Kong to attract different types of companies to list here. But as usual, devil is in the details. We need to see if the HKEX proposals are flexible enough to attract new technology companies to list here, while at the same time, that there is sufficient investor protection,” said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Stockbrokers Association chairman Benny Mau said if the HKEX would propose a third board, it would need to clearly define how the role and listing requirements are different from those for the main board and the GEM.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The consultation paper should also consult the market if all investors could invest in this new board or if it should be for institutional investors to trade only,” Mau said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SGX) expects to let the first company with a dual-class share structure list in the second half of this year as it looks to complement the Chinese onshore and Asian capital markets in allowing tech firms to raise funds, bourse officials told a media briefing in Hong Kong on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chew Sutat, executive vice-president of SGX said that a couple of “multibillion-dollar market cap” companies from Hong Kong are planning to list in Singapore in July and August, including one with a have a dual-class listing structure that has operations in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Chinese companies make up 20 per cent of the market cap of companies listed in Singapore, according to Chew.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We see ourselves playing an offshore complementary role to the emerging markets in Asia and that includes China and to a certain extent Hong Kong companies that are looking to expand overseas,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore is expected to release its dual class share rules in the coming weeks and aims to be a lot more freer than other markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For example, if you list an IPO in Hong Kong, the cornerstone investor is expected to be locked up for six months, but Singapore will not have that issue,” Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore may provide value when it come to the Chinese companies expanding their international business, and is likely to continue to attract consumer, tech, health care, REITs and infrastructure companies that want to extend their “overseas ambitions”, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wall Street unthreatened by Hong Kong's IPO rule changes[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2133566/wall-street-cheers-hong-kongs-ipo-rules-revamp-sees-new-yorks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nearly 40 per cent of all companies listed on SGX are international and account for more than 50 per cent of total market cap. Whereas only 6 per cent of all companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange are non-Chinese companies, according to data from the two exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's revamped IPO rules will take effect soon, allowing start-ups valued at US$1.5 billion to list shares under a dual-class shares scheme. Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has chosen the city over New York for its mega-IPO because of the planned reforms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore is a more international market than Hong Kong in terms of investors and companies that raise capital, Chew said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it is a Chinese focused technology business Hong Kong does better; we acknowledge that. But when it is pan-Asia business and Southeast Asia business then we a little bit better off,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese technology businesses developing international applications and looking to expand such as into South East Asia and South Asia under China's Belt and Road Initiative may choose Singapore to obtain better valuations and attention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International investors from the US, Japan and Korea that want to invest in emerging Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia but cannot get access to the markets directly could also use Singapore to invest into these companies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing reforms, due to kick-start later this month, are likely to attract more technology firms to list on its stock exchange - but only as long as the authorities can provide appropriate investor protection measures, the head of leading global fund manager Janus Henderson Investors has cautioned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, is now in a race with counterparts in mainland China, Singapore and the US to compete for new technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what's expected to be the largest listings shake-up in Hong Kong for three decades, dual-class shareholdings are likely to be included for tech and biotech companies without strict requirements on revenues and profit.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such a structure will allow one class of shareholders to own more voting right than others, an arrangement favoured by many founders keen to maintain control while still holding minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move comes after more than two years of consultation, and remains controversial, however.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While HKEX and many tech firms want to change the rules to allow them to list here, many fund houses oppose the change as they would violate the city's long-held “one share, one vote” principle, and may hurt the interest of minority investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major UK investor Aberdeen Standard Investments, for instance, does not favour these kinds of company listings, due to corporate governance concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1">, the fund industry's controlling body in the city, has also called on HKEX to require dual class shareholding companies to appoint more independent board directors, to safeguard the interests of fund companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Andrew Formica, Janus Henderson's co-chief executive, has now come out and said his company would invest in these companies, but only with the caveat they have good corporate governance standards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will the introduction of dual-class shares in Hong Kong boost Chinese tech shares listed in US?[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2131905/will-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong-kong-boost-chinese-tech]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[Investing in] technology companies is a fast growing market in the US and Europe,” Formica said in an interview with South China Morning Post.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Formica said after the merger, it has more resources to develop its new technology investment portfolio, and certainly aims to expand further in Asia and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Asia has a huge population and fast economic growth,” he said. “There are a lot of customers who have growing demand for investment services in the region.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based electronics and software company Xiaomi will reportedly be among the first batch of companies that will offer dual-class shares when they go public in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, one of China's largest technology firms, will soon choose its IPO sponsors after meeting several investment banks during the Christmas holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It has reportedly decided to make its debut in Hong Kong toward the end of this year, but it has yet to give a specific timeline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Chinese conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> (0656) has tapped CITIC CLSA, </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span><span class="s1"> to handle the Hong Kong IPO of its travel arm, which seeks to raise over US$500 million (HK$3.9 billion), according to media reports, citing people familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other IPO action, shares of </span><span class="s3">Wine's Link International Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Excalibur Global Financial Holdings will start trading in Hong Kong today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wine's Link International</span><span class="s1"> priced its IPO at 75 HK cents per share, at the high end of the 55 HK cents to 75 HK cents indicative range. It raised a net of HK$64.2 million from its public offering after its retail tranche was oversubscribed 12.5 times. Its share price closed at 83 HK cents in the gray market yesterday, 10.67 percent higher than its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Excalibur Global Financial</span><span class="s1"> said its IPO was oversubscribed 8.08 times. It raised HK$49.6 million net from its public offering.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia says completing the listing reform is one of its top priorities in 2018, and the local bourse has received inquiries from firms for dual-class share listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform, which is the first of listing rules in 25 years, will allow new-economy companies with dual-class shares to debut in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said a consultation about the changes in the listing rules is expected to be introduced after the Lunar New Year, and a discussion paper on the consultation is to be published in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes the local bourse can start to accept the listing applications from those new-economy companies as early as the end of June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said mainland exchanges will definitely welcome new-economy companies floating, and he would say "great minds think alike" if the Shenzhen exchange introduced more measures to attract such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since many companies are interested in going public in the SAR, Li said the HKEX will need more workforce to handle the listing applications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li added HKEX will hire some lawyers and accountants who have knowledge of biotechnology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange also plans to build an innovation lab to invest in financial technology enterprises, said Li. He hopes this lab will attract the young generation and entrepreneurs to dig out more new technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the fantastic year of 2017, HKEX will continue to improve its current Connect programmes by adding more products such as Exchange Traded Funds and seek to further develop mutual market access, said Li, adding that it will also explore A-share derivatives and other measures to strengthen the competitiveness of its derivatives market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The London-Hong Kong connect is expected to be launched next year after the Brexit from the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX also aims to enhance Bond Connect, including exploring a Southbound model, this year and prepare to launch the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange spot market to serve China's real economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Li said there is no official news about </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">'s initial public offering spot, but adding that he did not see any reason why the oil giant should not be in Hong Kong. He said </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> may not list in Hong Kong at the first go, but will eventually be here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> is seeking an overseas IPO in the second half of 2018, which is regarded as the largest IPO in the world. Hong Kong is competing with the New York and London exchanges to win the energy company.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1"> made a weak debut in Hong Kong yesterday, with the Chinese smartphone maker's shares ending 1.2 percent lower than its IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors were selling at a discount on the unofficial gray market last week, Bloomberg News reported, and there was some selling interest at a 5 percent discount.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Xiaomi is the first firm in Hong Kong to trade with a controversial dual-class structure since listing rules were overhauled to allow weighted voting rights for different sets of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi shares closed at HK$16.80, after touching a low of HK$16 in early trade, compared to the initial public offering price of HK$17 per share. The Hang Seng Index ended 1.3 percent higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Indexes Company said Xiaomi meets the fast-entry rule of the Hang Seng Composite Index. Constituent changes will be made to relevant indexes after the market close on July 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1"> will be included in the Hang Seng Composite Index, Hang Seng Global Composite Index and Hang Seng Internet &amp; Information Technology Index, with effect from July 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's IPO valued the firm, which also makes internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, at US$54 billion (HK$424 billion), almost half the US$100 billion it had initially hoped for and below its more recent target of at least US$70 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At yesterday's closing price the company had a market value of US$53.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HK$17 price valued the company at 39.6 times its forecast for 2018 earnings, while iPhone maker Apple is trading at 16 times and Chinese social media and gaming giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> at 36.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2010 by entrepreneur Lei Jun, Xiaomi is described by Lei as a new species of company with what he describes as a triathlon business model combining hardware, internet and e-commerce services. "We are an internet firm," Xiaomi chief executive Lei told the listing ceremony at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. "From day one, we've set up a dual-class share structure. Without the innovation of Hong Kong's capital markets, we wouldn't get a chance to go public in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked at the ceremony if the low pricing of Xiaomi and some other tech firms will weigh on upcoming IPOs, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said it was not up to the exchange to have a view. "The market is always open. It's open to everybody. If you don't like the price, you can stay away."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi sold 2.18 billion shares in its IPO, 1.4 billion of which were new shares. The deal was led by CLSA, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is now the biggest smartphone vendor in India and is pushing into European markets including Spain and Russia, though it has lost share in China recently to lower-cost rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say Hong Kong's technology listings have struggled in recent months, deflating investor interest, while escalating trade tensions have made it a bad time to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Nothing can help because the sentiment is no good at the moment - most of the IPOs listed this year were not that profitable," said Dickie Wong of Kingston Securities. He does not see any upsides until the CDR listing, which would boost interest.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BExcellent Group Holdings, a local private supplementary secondary school education services provider, is seeking to list again on the local bourse after failing to do so over a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to its IPO prospectus, five prominent tutors generated more than 60 percent of the company's total revenue. Jayden Lam Yat-yan, one of the most prominent tutors in Hong Kong, accounted for about 30 percent of its revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said he expects dual-class share companies, as well as new-economy firms, to list on the local bourse's main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the new board, proposed by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388), will not be introduced.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said HKEX will provide a summary of the public consultation on the proposed new board which started earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Together with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, the bourse will introduce a new round of consultation on further revising the listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said he expects the local bourse to start accepting next year listing applications of dual-class share companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other IPO action, </span><span class="s3">Nissin Foods Company</span><span class="s1"> will start bookbuilding today.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nissin Foods</span><span class="s1">, which owns the "Demae Iccho" brand, said its earnings for the first half fell to HK$91.62 million from HK$106.74 million a year earlier. Ando attributed the earnings fall to a spike in the cost of setting up new factories.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading in its shares will start on December 11.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors had kept their fingers crossed that Xiaomi's (1810) performance would be supported by capital from the mainland until the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses over the past weekend announced they would temporarily exclude companies with weighted voting rights from being traded under the Stock Connect programs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the first company to be listed in Hong Kong under a dual-class structure, Xiaomi went through a fast track to be added to the Hang Seng Composite Index before being accepted into the benchmark FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This saw the Chinese smartphone maker's shares recover from a lackluster debut with four consecutive days of gains. Its shares, which dived in the first days of trading but later rebounded 26 percent up on its IPO price, are now likely to be dragged down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from Xiaomi, HKEX (0388), the city's bourse operator is also among those likely to be affected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sudden decision of the two Chinese stock exchanges has several implications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firstly, it appears that the mainland's securities regulators, who last month postponed Xiaomi's Chinese depository receipts issue and later cast further doubts on it with a long list of questions on its listing arrangements, are not supportive of Xiaomi's dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secondly, as a new-economy firm, Xiaomi is seen as a guinea pig for testing the new listing rules. Hong Kong made no secret that it wants such companies included in Stock Connect schemes as it believed Xiaomi investors would want to trade southbound in the absence of a CDR offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thirdly, the ruling signals intensified competition between bourses on either side of the border and highlights their discord over IPO issues. The HKEX, which used to call the mainland regulators "brothers," was just given very short notice and told of the decision just hours before the official announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the city's stock exchange operator has said it will work closely with mainland regulators and strive to include new economy companies in Stock Connect schemes, this is unlikely to happen any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is another reason as to why the regulators have barred mainland investors from trading in Xiaomi - don't forget, China's market has recently been short of capital. Its A-shares have been very weak and that's why Xiaomi CDR issue was postponed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is no doubt that China's regulators might want a firmer grip on capital fleeing to Hong Kong and the HKEX and Xiaomi are now the losers this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's shares will be under pressure this week while HKEX - which is banking on new economy firms from the mainland to list in Hong Kong and to support its development - will likely encounter a bumpy ride.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The only winner may be Tencent (0700), which slid immediately after Xiaomi was accepted by the HSCI. Tencent's stock is likely to win support again and the forthcoming release of its results a few weeks down the line could put the internet giant firmly back on track.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index yesterday closed up 0.7 percent, or 202 points higher at 29,050 points. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index ended trading at 11,415 points, up 49 points or 0.4 percent. Turnover stood at HK$92.08 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) jumped 4.24 percent, the biggest gainer among blue chips. HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the biggest listing structure reform in the Hong Kong market in recent years will allow new-economy companies, with dual-class shares and have yet to produce a profit, to debut in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If a completely new class of new-economy firms are introduced, they will be fundamentally different and will help fuel substantial growth of the local market. The uptrend will be fueled by money from the north, the southbound connect and new-economy firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Securities Association chairman Gary Cheung said a sunset clause for dual-class shares should be set to protect investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said large capitalization of start-ups will help in their long-term development although those firms may not produce profits in the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> has issued a circular to licensed corporations relating to liquidity risk management.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said that between January 2014 and August 2015, Standard Chartered Securities failed to put in place adequate system and control procedures, resulting in at least 61 instances of regulatory breaches involving short sales executed by 11 traders from different trading desks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his tenure, the public generally viewed the most controversial issue he handled was whether to allow the listing of firms with weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, the SFC objected to the draft proposal by the Hong Kong stock exchange to accept primary listings with weighted voting rights structures. But it later changed its stance toward supporting the controversial dual-class listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba ended up listing in New York, as the United States allowed dual-class listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I have no regrets that Alibaba did not list in Hong Kong because the listing rules at that time did not allow it," Tong said, adding, "it was not appropriate to grant an exemption just because the company was big."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to joining SFC, Tong was involved in regulatory work of the securities and futures markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) scrapped plans to introduce the dual-class shares draft proposal following rejection from the Securities and Futures Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse listing committee will not finalize the draft proposal on weighted voting rights, which allows companies to issue shares with differing voting rights, nor proceed with a formal consultation, it said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx had proposed to loosen the current ``one-share-one-vote'' restrictions for certain companies with specific safeguards in June after a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a week later, the securities market watchdog formally opposed such change, as it can potentially erode the rights of minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Whilst the listing committee continues to believe that this is an important topic for Hong Kong and one that deserved the full attention of the Hong Kong market, it does not believe that progress can be made, currently,'' HKEx said. But the matter will be kept under review, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia responded shortly after the SFC opposition, saying that ``The SFC is the big boss [it] sets the rules, and we the staff follow, in line with procedure.'' SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said he respects the HKEx decision, and does not believe it will affect companies seeking to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial innovation and weighted voting rights are not related, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Webb, a corporate governance activist, said on his website the original HKEx proposal ``exposed the blatant conflict of interests in the exchange being a for-profit regulator.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has worked on the weighted voting rights issue for some two years, it said. It has explored ways to change the listing rules since Alibaba chose to list in New York for its US$25 billion (HK$195 billion) initial public offering in September last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba insisted the listed entity be allowed to be controlled by a handful of its founders who did not hold a majority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was second in global IPO rankings last year behind New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shares, including top technology firms, have been given the green light to trade publicly in Hong Kong after the approval of the biggest change to listing rules in two decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said those companies will be allowed to go public in Hong Kong after the city lost Alibaba and other tech firms to venues in New York due to the barring of dual-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rule takes effect on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to HKEX, tech companies that have shares with different voting rights are required to have a market value of at least HK$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If not, they should be valued at least HK$10 billion and have a revenue of no less than HK$1 billion in the latest fiscal year. Tech firms should be valued at least HK$1.5 billion, and their operating capital needs to be equal to 1.25 times of IPO proceeds. Their products should be under the regulations of the United States or Europe.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia, who worked for the changes, said he believes many companies will queue up, adding it will welcome the first batch of IPOs under the new listing regime in June or July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX has set up a tech consultative panel with up to 14 staff members. The final name list will be introduced on Monday, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many companies that have indicated to us that they are ready to file for an application," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think everybody is just waiting for the rules to be published. I don't want to speculate, but I do think the number of companies will be in the dozens," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, Alibaba-backed </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1"> and Lufax, which is backed by </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, are expected to be in the first batch of companies to list under the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, in particular, is considering listing in both Hong Kong and Shanghai and targeting a valuation of around US$100 billion (HK$780 billion), which is regarded as one of the biggest tech offerings in the world this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's largest and most influential tech firms, from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> to </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> parent Alphabet, have share classes with different voting rights to protect their founders' influence after going public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Bloomberg report said the structures are contentious because they reduce the rights of other shareholders, and investors including </span><span class="s3">BlackRock</span><span class="s1"> opposed HKEX's plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange needs to introduce additional measures to protect minority shareholder rights if it allows the listing of shares with unequal voting rights, including putting a time limit on them, Norway's sovereign wealth fund argues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange proposed in December to introduce dual-class shares, which typically give one set of shareholders greater voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of Chinese tech groups are considering where to list their shares in 2018. And unequal voting structures are favored by technology companies as a protection against shareholder pressure for short-term returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The influential Norwegian government pension fund - the world's largest with assets of US$1 trillion (HK$7.78 trillion) - wrote to the Hong Kong exchange to say that while it supports measures to motivate companies to go public it was concerned about the impact on minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We regard the protection of minority shareholder rights as a necessary requirement to safeguard and promote the fund's long-term financial interests," it said. "To maintain market standards for investor protection we see the need for additional measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One measure should be a time-based phase-out of unequal voting rights, and another should be to strengthen standards governing the independence of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unequal voting structures have been criticized by corporate governance advocates, who warn of potential abuse by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Certain matters, such as transactions involving entities associated with holders of weighted voting rights, should always be subject to the "one share one vote" principle, the fund said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, also known as the oil fund and one of the world's largest investors, said it had US$26.6 billion invested in shares listed in Hong Kong at the end of 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is on track to lose its much-coveted crown as the world's top initial public offering (IPO) market as the year draws to a close, with latest figures showing total funds raised here have dropped 48 per cent compared with 12 months ago, leaving the city ranked third behind New York and Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">IPO funding raised by 67 companies on the main board of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) this year stood at US$12.29 billion as of Wednesday, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">, compared with US$23.72 billion at the same stage of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York's 67 IPOs raised US$28.93 billion and Shanghai saw 197 companies raise US$18.69 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The disappointing Hong Kong result comes even after a recent flurry of new listings in the past two months - but even those failed to turn the tide in its favour.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city has been the top IPO market for the past two years, but a lack of real blockbuster new listings and its failure especially to attract tech firms, have been blamed for getting kicked it off its perch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan has already announced a consultation paper will be launched by HKEX in the first quarter of next year on plans to examine allowing dual class stock listings - a type favoured by many technology or new economy companies - which it hopes will help reverse its fortunes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/12/06/cdf36ba2-da44-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_161237.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual class stock is the issuing of normally two types of shares by a single company, possibly offering more voting rights or dividend per share than other classes of shareholdings. That is the type favoured by tech giants </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share class might be offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives or family. The class offered to the general public has limited voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides them majority control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is allowed in the US, but has been banned in Hong Kong since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the world's largest IPO this year raised US$3.91 billion, adopted a dual class shareholding structure for its offering in New York. Its stock exchange had three IPO among the top 10 in the year-to-date, including two hi-tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong market, in contrast, is still dominated by "old economy" financial firms, seven of which make up its top 10 largest.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1"> was Hong Kong's largest IPO this year raising HK$16.5 billion (US$2.22 billion), which was also the only domestic listing to squeeze into the global top 10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other more-recent heavyweight HK floats have come from China's largest online car retailer </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (US$866), gaming device maker Razer (US$524m), China Literature (US$1.06b), China's largest online publishing and e-book site, a unit of Tencent, and ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty Insurance (US$1.52b), China's first online-only insurer backed by Alibaba affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Services Group</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> .[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2122515/hong-kongs-ipo-fever-over-after-nissin-and-shandong-intl-fail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong needs to fight for both old and new economy companies to list here," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for financial services sector who is also a broker, "so as such, we should allow companies with dual class shareholding structure to be listed".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we would need to add in a number of measures to safeguard the interest of investors," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested, for instance, having sunset clauses - regulations that can automatically be abolishing - and possible expiry dates on adopting such a structure. One sunset clause might be the company would have the option to delist, if the founder or key management members were to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norm Champ, a partner at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, and the former director of investment management at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it would be "smart" for</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong to change its listing regime to allow dual class share structures, given the fierce IPO market worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SEC and the </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> are also very keen on getting more companies to list in New York by easing the disclosure regulations," said Champ.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the actual number of listed companies in the US has fallen by half over the past two decades as many companies stayed private, or delisted, to escape the expense and scrutiny of being public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SEC may also relax some regulations such as the disclosure of the pay ratio of the chief executive to other employees, Champ said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The IPO market has bounced back in the US this year, and that trend is likely to continue."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New economy companies seeking to list dual-class shares in Hong Kong could be eligible to apply by the end of June, according to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing[https://www.scmp.com/topics/hong-kong-stock-exchange] (HKEx) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a listing reform plan announced last month, HKEx will allow biotech firms without revenue and other large new economy companies with dual-class shares to list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said a six- to eight-week consultation on the rule change will begin in February after the Lunar New Year[https://www.scmp.com/topics/lunar-new-year] holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If all goes well, we hope all the rule changes would be ready in early June and we can start to accept applications for listing from new economy and biotech companies,” Li said on the sidelines of the Asian Financial Forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shareholding structure had been prohibited in Hong Kong since the mid-1980s. These share structures are favoured by technology companies such as Facebook[https://www.scmp.com/topics/facebook] or Alphabet as they enable founders to maintain control of the company even though they only hold a minority of the listed shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's ban on the dual-share structure is believed to be one of the main reasons why the city lost out when mainland Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for New York in its record US$25 billion IPO in 2014[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/1599023/alibaba-ipo-size-boosted-after-it-took-walk].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li declined to identify which companies have contacted the exchange since the proposed rule change, although mainland handset maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi] is rumoured to be among the candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said he also welcomed US-listed new economy companies seeking a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the HKEx proposal unveiled in December, “innovative” Chinese companies with a market capitalisation of more than HK$10 billion (US$1.27 billion) will be eligible to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong as long as they have a primary on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, or </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Alibaba, Baidu[https://www.scmp.com/topics/baidu], and JD.com[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jd] are all very large Chinese new economy companies listed in the US,” Li said. “Our reform would allow these companies to list here. I cannot say if an individual company would decide to list in Hong Kong, but we can have a regulatory framework ready for them to consider to list here.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba[https://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba] executive chairman Jack Ma Yun[https://www.scmp.com/topics/jack-ma] last week said he would consider listing in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2127362/jack-ma-consider-listing-alibaba-hong-kong-stock-exchange] upon a request by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[https://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also said he hoped an ETF connect and a derivate connect would launch this year, but cautioned that more progress on technical issues was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said that the existing stock connect scheme had helped to pump up daily market turnover. In the first three weeks of the year turnover has risen to HK$130 billion, compared to HK$88.25 billion in 2017 and HK$66.92 billion in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hoped at least one giant tech company would list here under the new rules by October 2018, when he retires after a six-year stint with the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong, while the tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu would consider secondary listings here after the new rule changes for dual-class share companies are introduced next year,” said Tong.“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong.”Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman, Securities and Futures Commission</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This follows the rejection in 2014 of a plan by e-commerce giant Alibaba to adopt a structure that would allow its founder, Jack Ma Yun, and key executives to appoint more than half of the company's board. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange in 2015 proposed to allow these companies to list but the proposal was scrapped following objections by the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> unveiled a proposal to allow giant technology companies with at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) to list with multiple classes of shares, and biotech companies with no revenue to list in Hong Kong after a rule change by mid next year. This time, Tong indicated his support but stressed that proper investor protection measures must be in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Let us be clear, we still believe that ‘one-share, one-vote' is the gold standard since it has never been proven that companies with weighted voting rights perform better in the long run. We do accept, however, that to attract new economy companies to list in Hong Kong and to make our market more vibrant, we need to change,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The challenge that Hong Kong faces is one of competition, which is fully supported by market statistics, he said. About 50 per cent of the mainland technology companies listed in the United States have multiple-class shareholding structures, versus only 17 per cent for non-mainland technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, only 8 per cent of mainland non-technology companies listed in the US have multiple-class shareholding structures, about the same level as non-mainland non-technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This suggests that mainland technology companies prefer weighted voting rights structures and if Hong Kong wants to attract these companies to list in its market, we have to find a way to accommodate those that we consider to be of substance and quality,” he said, adding that the commission will work closely with HKEX on safeguards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong also said one of the reasons for the commission's objection in 2015 was that due to large fund houses worries about these companies would be added to the benchmark index and, as such, passive fund managers would be forced to invest in them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Recently, both FTSE Russell and S&amp;P have decided to place restrictions on the admission of companies with weighted voting rights in their indices, although MSCI has decided to carry out further consultation,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, some large fund houses such as Black Rock rejected the idea of index providers restricting weighted voting rights companies from their index as they believe the fund houses should have the right to choose what companies to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They would rather see protective measures such as sunset clauses. Clearly, there has been a slow shift of mindset … accepting some form of weighted voting rights companies.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regard to the commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption</span><span class="s1"> (ICAC) joining hands to raid the offices of financial company Convoy Global, Tong declined to comment on the case but confirmed the commission would, where necessary, continue to collaborate with other regulators and enforcement agencies such as ICAC, Hong Kong Police and mainland regulator </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> in combating financial crimes to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said investors should be aware of market uncertainties in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Going into 2018, the capital market may face many uncertainties, including Brexit, geopolitical risks in North Korea and the Middle East, and the US interest rate rises,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US stock market may adjust itself and if it happens, it will affect the rest of the world, including Hong Kong, which has recorded substantial gains over the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would therefore like to remind investors that they need to be very cautious and prudent in making their investment decisions and to not take excessive risks.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong will find it hard to attract secondary listings by mainland technology companies such as e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which are already listed in the United States, because of competition from China, Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Beijing's plan to introduce China depository receipts will be a big threat to Hong Kong. When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong Kong,” Leung said during a forum of the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will led to more new economy companies that have not yet listed to opt for listing in the US instead of Hong Kong, as they will think they can issue China depository receipts at a later stage.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung is known as the “father of red chips”. As a well-known investment banker in the 1990s, he brought many red chips - companies with a mainland parent incorporated overseas - to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Those listed in the US already have exposure to international investors. The reason for them to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong is to capture mainland investors who trade these stocks via the stock connects. If China were to invite these companies to issue China depository receipts on the mainland, there is no point in them having a secondary listing here,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the China depository receipt requirements are very high, and only the very large companies will be invited by authorities to issue these in China. As such, companies that do not qualify will still like to list in Hong Kong after the listing reform,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Father of red chips' backs new board to attract unicorns, but not new start-ups[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2107680/father-red-chips-backs-new-board-attract-unicorns-not-new]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung added that mainland companies too wanted to list in Hong Kong, because they wanted to capture international investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that faced with such competition, the Hong Kong stock exchange would need to be more proactive in its fight for such companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the local bourse operator, announced its biggest reform in 25 years on Tuesday. It will from Monday allow dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotechnology companies with no revenue to apply for listings here. Dual-class shareholding companies allow founders, or key management of the companies, to hold a premium class of shares that has higher voting rights than normal shareholders, a structure favoured by many technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Leung said the reform had not gone far enough. He said it was not right for the HKEX to require that premium class shareholders have the same voting rights as ordinary shareholders when they elect independent non-executive directors, or change articles of association.When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong KongFrancis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of allowing dual-class shareholding structure companies to list here is to allow the founders and key management to keep control over major issues even though they hold minority stakes. Waiving their special rights to appoint independent directors to the board will not reduce their influence on the board,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX introduced this requirement to meet a demand by fund managers for added protection for investors. Leung, however, said the bourse operator should achieve balance to make sure founders and management have control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the HKEX should expand the reform to allow companies, instead of just individuals, to hold these premium class shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Chan Mo-po, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, who was present at the forum, said: “The government supports the listing reform allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list here, provided there are sufficient investor protection measures. The HKEX reform announced on Tuesday will help Hong Kong become a listings hub for technology companies.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposed regulations on variable interest entities (VIEs) in a new draft of China's foreign investment law may put more obstacles in the way of companies with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong while encouraging e-commerce firms to incorporate in the Shanghai free-trade zone, lawyers and accountants said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese companies have been using VIE structures to list overseas, allowing foreign capital to get around Beijing's foreign ownership restrictions on some sectors, such as the internet industry. </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and Baidu all use such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In some cases where [China] has imposed shareholding restrictions on foreign investments in certain industries, the VIE structures may shield the shareholders in real control," said Roy Lo Wa-kei, a deputy managing partner of accounting firm Shinewing. "The proposed law would require more disclosure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The government could gather more data from VIE firms through the new regulation. But the risks for the companies would be they might have to reveal any practice of non-compliance covered by the VIE structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The draft of the foreign investment law published by the Ministry of Commerce would legitimise VIE structures but also require companies using such structures to prove they were ultimately controlled by Chinese investors, otherwise they would be treated as foreign-invested enterprises and might fall foul of a "negative list" of industries with foreign investment restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The law is now in a consultation period, with the deadline for submitting comments on February 17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Haiwen &amp; Partners, a Beijing-based law firm, said the regulations on VIEs could lead to obstacles for firms with such structures seeking to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are not yet listed, the clauses on [Chinese] investors selling stakes in offshore companies to foreign investors could be subject to restrictions in the law on foreign investments, such as foreign ownership," Haiwen said in a note to clients. "In some cases, the clauses could not be implemented, thus there may be legal obstacles if they want to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"More disclosure would also be required when they list in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For companies with VIE structures that are already listed, restrictions on the transfer of [mainland] shareholders' shares in foreign investment would severely reduce the liquidity of their shares, and affect the valuation of such companies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, said Alibaba, Baidu and other firms with dual-class share structures would benefit in the proposed regulatory change as dual-class share structures could help keep the company founders in control, which in turn would ensure their firms were not deemed foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, companies such as Tencent, with VIE structures but without dual-class shares, might be treated as foreign-invested enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The proposed law encourages companies to set up using a dual-class share structure," Gillis said. "Hong Kong does not permit such companies to list, which will be a huge win for New York."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US exchange permits dual-class share structures, which was why Alibaba listed in New York instead of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The consultation paper points to a positive direction that VIE structures will be formally recognised by the [mainland] government and governed by the proposed new legislation," a Tencent spokesman said. "As this is in the early stage of consultation, we are monitoring the progress closely."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In order not to loose access to the Chinese market due to the regulatory change, e-commerce companies without ultimate mainland control might want to incorporate in or move their VIEs to the Shanghai free-trade zone, which had indicated it would allow wholly owned foreign investment in e-commerce, Gillis said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paul Weiss, another law firm preparing to submit comments on the draft law, said more clarity was needed on whether a company would be deemed to have ultimate Chinese control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For example, what if the [Chinese] and foreign investors both satisfy the control definition? What if a founder of a VIE structure has de facto control over the business but only holds a small minority interest in the foreign parent entity controlling the VIE structure and does not have special board appointment rights?" it said in a note to clients.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scramble by mainland China's two stock markets to lure foreign-funded technology firms is firmly back on track, as its financial regulators revisit their plan to create a fast track mechanism for share offerings by what many consider will be the profitmaking stars of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this time, their on-off-on-again plan - first revealed way back in 2001 - is set to have greater substance, say commentators, since the leadership is more determined than ever to inject some entrepreneurial vigour into the economy to drive long-term growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will ratchet up the pressure on Hong Kong, as a tug of war over listing resources gradually takes the strain.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> officials said in a statement over the weekend it has prepared a package of services aimed squarely at tempting “unicorns” - unlisted tech firms valued at more than US$1 billion - and has already visited to a clutch of high-quality companies, to pitch for their listing on the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invited them to Shanghai, so they can gain first-hand experience (of our facilities and systems),” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are also reaching out to help them overcome difficulties in accessing the capital markets,” it added, without casting a light on any actual names.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland's top securities regulators, including chairman of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) </span><span class="s1">Liu Shiyu, confirmed last week too that Beijing is rethinking its building of a mechanism to attract domestic technology firms, financed by foreign funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's own securities regulator, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC), and its stock exchange are also conducting the city's largest listing reforms in decades, aimed at enhancing the bourse's attractiveness to technology listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June, large biotech companies, for instance, without strong revenue track records as well as more mainstream technology firms with dual-class shareholding structures will be allowed to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That dual-class share structure, will allow shareholders - most of whom are founding members - to have more voting rights or enjoy more dividends, and is favoured by many tech founders as the majority hold minority stakes but still want to maintain control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> (which owns the South China Morning Post) chose to list in New York after Hong Kong's refusal to allow a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC quickly recognised the competitive pressures this put the city under in attracting listings by new-economy companies, and threw its weight last December behind its own proposed listing reforms, that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some technology firms being courted by both exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland have chosen to list A-shares only - yuan-denominated shares bought and traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges - because of the domestic market's higher valuations and the convenience,” said Cao Hua, a partner at private equity group Unity Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Expect to this see-saw game between the two markets[Hong Kong and the mainland] intensifying in coming years.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, a would-be, fast track listing mechanism proposed to be launched in 2015 was seen as a winning formula which underlined its efforts to set up a dedicated board for emerging industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that was put on ice after a summer stock market rout exacerbated regulator worries about a further slide in key economic indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That board was particularly designed to welcome relistings by privatised Chinese tech firms, which had previously traded in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Foxconn Industrial Internet - a unit of the world's largest contract manufacturer whose products include Apple's iPhones - received the go-ahead from the CSRC to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai, just five short weeks after it filed an application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The green light granted to the 27 billion yuan (US$4.27 billion) fundraising was the clearest sign yet that the CSRC is now prioritising technology IPOs as a way of bolstering the country's levels of technical innovation - a key component of the Chinese leadership's attempt to create an economy reliant on slower, but more sustainable growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most of the country's promising start-ups have been backed in the past by foreign private equity and venture capital funds, under the so-called VIE (variable interest entity) structure, and could only list in markets such as Hong Kong and New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A VIE structure allows founders and investment funds to set up offshore vehicles which can sign contracts with Chinese firms, giving the latter effective control of the resultant offshore vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To woo VIE firms into an A-share listing, regulators now need to amend securities and corporate laws and revise domestic listing rules, as direct investment in China's A-share market is off-limits to foreign companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai exchange says it has already started putting together a blueprint to attract IPOs by foreign companies, particularly “red chips”, or mainland companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong, but with controlling Chinese shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Two Shanghai exchange officials said its fresh initiative to attract technology-leading IPOs has the solid backing of the Chinese leadership, further north in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of their agenda is clearly creating the next generation of tech behemoths on a par with established leaders such as Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, with the full backing of the domestic capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And with the Shanghai exchange beating its Hong Kong counterpart in terms of value for IPOs for the first time last year, the signs are strong that more investors could well take the bait.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong should only allow exceptionally big technology firms with multiple class share structure to list in the city to prevent poor quality ones from abusing the system, say bankers and lawmakers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new listing rule reform is exciting as it would allow more technology companies to consider the prospect of a Hong Kong listing and allow investors to be able to participate in these new economy companies,” Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive of China Renaissance, a Chinese investment bank that has helped many start-ups and biotech firms to list, told the South China Morning Post in an interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it is very important for HKEX [Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing] to keep the bar high to maintain high standards while accepting a broader range of listing candidates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is in the midst of its largest listing reform in decades aimed at lifting the exchange's attractiveness to compete for more technology firms to list here instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From June large biotech firms without revenue and giant technology firms with dual class shareholding structure would be allowed to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual class share companies allow one class of shareholders to have more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders. These are favoured by many tech firm founders as many of them hold minority stakes but want to have control. Meanwhile, biotech firms usually have no revenue in the research period. The current Hong Kong listing rules do not allow them to list here but they can list in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at the US, there are in fact not many technology companies listed in the dual class share structure, but only the very large and successful ones such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">,” Bao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abused.”The HKEX should make sure only the very large technology companies that have proven to be very successful have special rights to list in such structure to prevent the system from being abusedFan Bao, chairman and CEO of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX next month will issue a detailed consultation on the listing reform, but Bao wants to see more investor protection measures in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The view is echoed by fund mangers and lawmakers, with many calling for a “sunset clause” - a provision that requires these dual class share companies, after certain years of listing, to seek shareholders' approval to continue with the structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing, however, told lawmakers during the financial affairs panel meeting last week that the exchange would not go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we were to introduce such a sunset clause, some tech companies might consider Hong Kong to be too restrictive and they may not come here to list,” Tong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Kenneth Leung, lawmaker for accountancy, said the exchange could consider setting a longer period such as 20 years for the sunset clause.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole idea of letting the founders have special voting rights is to allow them to have control for a longer time to implement their vision. If they are doing well for 20 years, the investors would support and approve them to continue to have special voting rights. If they do not do a good job, investors should also have the right to say no,” Leung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A proposal by Hong Kong and mainland China's stock exchanges to let investors partake in initial public offerings in each other's markets has been given an added impetus by the prospect of attracting the US$2 trillion </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> to raise funds in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is one of several global equity bourses including New York, London, Tokyo, Toronto and Singapore contending to be the staging ground for Aramco's IPO, estimated to be US$100 billion in size. The proposal, known as the “Primary Equity Connect,” would let investors from China's US$7.6 trillion capital market gain access to the Aramco IPO through Hong Kong, increasing the city's attractiveness as a place for raising capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From China's side, Aramco listing in Hong Kong can also provide a “natural hedge” for domestic investors against the oil price volatility, said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), the exchange operator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The “primary equity connect” and the Aramco listing in Hong Kong can be a successful combination, as both sides are able to benefit from it, Li said during a conference in the city. “It's a win-win situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li didn't specify on the timetable of the launch of primary equity connect, but said the exchange has been in talks with relevant parties. “We never stop (the talks),” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, Li said in his blog that the “Primary Equity Connect” is feasible from a technical perspective, but important work remains for regulators to iron out the right regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The connect plan is the latest piece of a process of fostering closer integration between Hong Kong's equity market with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has launched three of the so-called connect schemes since 2014 with Chinese markets to facilitate cross-border trading. These comprised the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016, and the Bond Connect in July.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco, owned and run by the government of Saudi Arabia, plans to sell up to 5 per cent of the oil company in a 2018 IPO in one or more international markets beyond the stock exchange in Riyadh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even listing only 5 per cent of the US$2 trillion company would lead to a US$100 billion IPO, the biggest ever in world history, and leagues ahead of Alibaba's record US$25 billion flotation in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, Li also said the HKEX has finished the consultation on a new trading board and the conclusion could “hopefully” come out in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX started a public consultation in June for establishing a so-called “third board”, after the current board and Growth Enterprise Market, aiming to lure more new economy listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board could allow companies ranging from internet start-ups to biotech firms with dual-class share structures to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX has received positive feedbacks about establishing the “third board”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange might launch a second round of consultation on details about listing rules, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to find new ways to lure new economy companies to stay competitive,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX proposed in 2015 to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February, Singapore's stock exchange started a public consultation on introducing a dual-class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014, Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted to list in New York as its corporate governance structure was refused in Hong Kong. It triggered a hot debate in Hong Kong on dual-class shares and how to balance the interests of founding shareholders and executives with investors'.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has failed to secure a spot in the top 10 league table for funds raised from IPOs of technology companies worldwide, which surged three times to US$18.87 billion in the first eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong's main board only ranked at the world's 12th largest market in terms of IPO funds raised by technology companies, while the second board Growth Enterprise Market ranked 19th.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This marks a contrast to the ranking for the world's largest IPO market, where Hong Kong's main board is placed fourth as its strength lies in drawing financial firms to list, but not technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet, Hong Kong has seen improvement this year. So far, three technology firm IPOs have raised a combined US$424.1 million this year, which is 30 times higher than the same period last year when one firm raised US$14.8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The increase is largely attributed to the IPO of FIT Hon Teng, a subsidiary of the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer and maker of connectors for Apple's iPhones that raised US$393.58 million in June. It was also the world's eighth largest technology firm IPO this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/24/39ca4cb6-88c3-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_image_hires_205050.jpg]Despite the improvement, funds raised from technology firm IPOs on the main board only accounted for 2.3 per cent of global technology firm IPOs. The volume is substantially lower than the New York Stock Exchange, the top technology IPO centre, where four technology firm IPOs to date have raised US$4.56 billion, accounting for 24.2 per cent of global funds raised, the Thomson Reuters data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Swiss Stock Exchange ranked second and South Korean ranked third, while Shenzhen ChiNext ranked fourth, and Singapore was fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other markets,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the city's financial services sector.Hong Kong needs to launch the third board as soon as possible to catch up with other marketsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has been a worldwide trend that there are more and more new economy and technology companies seeking for listings. They are the future driving force of the worldwide economy. If our market could not capture these companies to list, we would lag behind,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has just completed a consultation to set up a third board to attract more technology companies to list, but it would still need a second round of consultation for the detailed rules. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wants the new board to be launched in the first half of 2018, but he will have to convince all stakeholders to accept the proposals that have received very mixed reactions during the two-month consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will have different regulations from the existing main board and the Growth Enterprise Market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX has proposed the third board to have two markets: a premium market for companies eligible to list on the main board but with dual-class shareholding structures and open to all investors, and a second market for start-ups and open only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong currently bans dual class shares which are allowed in the US. Dual class shareholding allows founders or key management of the companies to own shares with more voting rights than the others, which large technology firms like </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> preferred.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Snap, the largest technology IPO this year which raised US$3.9 billion on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in March, also has a dual class share structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, Francis Leung Pak-to on Monday showed support for a new market for dual class share companies with a market cap of HK$8 billion (US$1 billion) to list, but opposed to a start-up board market as he said the risks of failures of these newly set up companies were too high.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A contentious proposal to allow dual share listings on Hong Kong's bourse emerged top of the agenda at an inaugural meeting of financial heavyweights initiated by the chief executive, signalling the government's determination to reform the city's capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The forum, championed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor[http://www.scmp.com/topics/carrie-lam] and chaired by the finance chief, held its first meeting on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po[http://www.scmp.com/topics/paul-chan] confirmed the attendees had discussed whether to allow dual-class share companies to list in the city after receiving separate briefings from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We had a very good discussion with some very good opinions raised,” Chan told reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He revealed the two market bodies would do “follow-up work” on what had been discussed and that the forum would meet again next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A government statement quoted Chan as saying at the closed-door meeting: “The Government attaches great importance to enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre. While we endeavour to uphold market quality, we should also actively seek to further develop and broaden our capital markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the meeting, HKEX, operator of Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, set out its proposal for the establishment of a third board to give companies with dual-share structures a way to list as well as those with no track record of profit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The public consultation ended earlier this month, with financial industry professionals still divided over the matter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's support reflects a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it deemed the proposal at the time lacking sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As recently as last month, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder, also a forum member, said there was a need to reposition Hong Kong's listed market amid the shrinking size of initial public offerings in the past decade and trading volume in newly listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there was a need to strike a balance between “a healthier supply of interesting companies” at the top end of the stock market and greater demand by investors for more diverse companies at the lower end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A source at the meeting revealed that the consultation showed consensus on broadening markets and allowing dual-class shares but opinion was split on how to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carrie Lam, who met the forum members before they had their pow-wow, was quoted in the government press release as saying that the financial services sector, as a pillar industry contributing 18 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, should seize opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area proposal to “better serve our real economy”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many major technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> offer dual-class shares, which allow some shareholders to have more rights than others. Unlike the US, Hong Kong bars such shares, favouring the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forum member Dr David Wong Yau-kar, chairman of the Mandatory Provident Fund[http://www.scmp.com/topics/mpf] Schemes Authority, noted the attendees on Wednesday had raised their views on the proposed third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most people agree Hong Kong should attract new-economy companies to list here, but the question is how to do it. Do we need a new board?” he asked. “Do we accept dual-class share companies? Do we accept start-ups that have not made a profit? There are many different ways to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong added he could not detail individual views or the government's stance, citing confidentiality.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Executive councillors Bernard Chan, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, Chow Chung-kong and Joseph Yam Chi-kwong are also members, as are Carlson Tong Ka-shing and Moses Cheng Mo-chi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 30 government reports on financial matters were distributed to the 10 forum members to keep track of proposals and their implementation and they agreed to meet again in the next quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong described the forum as not a decision-making body but a high-ranking consultation group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Carrie Lam is very concerned about the group, as she initiated it in her manifesto,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The chief executive announced the forum during her election campaign earlier this year, saying the government should play a more active and leading role in policymaking and matters of monetary stability, financial safety and regulation. The idea was to reinforce Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam believed the forum could offer a platform to discuss strategic and forward-looking proposals and keep track of the implementation of such proposals by government departments and other relevant parties.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States will not be an easy option for the potential US$15 billion listing of Alibaba, which has been stuck in a war of words with the Hong Kong stock exchange and regulator over its listing plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government and financial industry sources familiar with the situation told the South China Morning Post that the e-commerce giant would face similar problems regarding its shareholding structure as it did with Hong Kong authorities if it decided to list on the New York Stock Exchange or its smaller rival Nasdaq.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike the stock markets in the US, Hong Kong's listing policy does not allow companies to issue two classes of shares. What Alibaba has been seeking goes even beyond dual class - an arrangement that would help founder Jack Ma Yun and his management team retain control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the partnership structure that Alibaba has been pushing for, the average shareholder would be even more disadvantaged than the dual-class listing model the US permits, and this is why it would encounter the same resistance there as well, lawyers say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the system allowed in the US, equity shareholders have the power to nominate or dispose of directors. Under Alibaba's preferred structure, they would not enjoy these rights, leaving them with no effective monitoring role, said lawyers specialising in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class voting structure is common in the US markets as many technology firms, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, adopted it to go public. It allowed the senior management, including the founders, of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> to retain control of the companies even as they tapped the market for funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, if Alibaba wants to restructure the company's current partnership model into a dual-class voting model, it will take a long time to go through the internal processes and garner the approval of its existing shareholders. Besides, the partnership Ma prefers is not common for a company of Alibaba's size seeking a listing in the US, say lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong regulators want absolute transparency in disclosure as well as suitability for listing, which includes corporate governance, while the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> [of the US] is not a prudential regulator and focuses on whether a company's disclosure includes all information that investors would regard as material to their investment decision, including whether the company meets the corporate governance standards of the relevant stock exchange," said Steven Winegar, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong stock exchange operator have made it clear to Alibaba that there is no room for exemption for any company as listing rules do not allow preferential treatment of one set of shareholders over another. Alibaba may find itself similarly hamstrung in persuading the US regulators, given its history of a public spat with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> over a secret transfer of Alipay's ownership to Jack Ma's private company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has more than 20 partners, including Ma, his co-founders and other senior executives. Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, which together own more than 60 per cent, are not included in the partnership structure that was established internally in 2009. </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> have both said they support Alibaba's partnership structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma's problems with a US listing for Alibaba goes beyond the partnership structure. The bigger concern would be rebuilding his credibility on Wall Street after a 2011 dispute with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, one of Alibaba's early investors and major shareholders, on secretly transferring one of the most valuable assets of the group to a third party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma shocked Wall Street in May 2011 when investors realised he had transferred Alipay, a leading online payment system created and owned by Alibaba, to a private company held by Ma outside the group. </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> was outraged and some US fund managers even threatened to sue Ma in the US. </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba later resolved their differences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The case, which came to be commonly known as the "VIE problem" on Wall Street - referring to an investment vehicle called a "variable interest entity" that allows mainland firms to access capital from foreign investors through offshore platforms rather than through their mainland entities to avoid China's tight and complicated foreign exchange controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incident triggered a round of sell-offs in US-listed mainland firms, including Sina.com China's No2 web portal, as US investors became suspicious of mainland companies imitating the Alibaba case.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is still permissible for Chinese companies to list with VIEs in their corporate structure, but investors are mindful of </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">'s months-long battle over the ownership of Alipay," Winegar said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a Xinhua piece in 2009, Ma said: "Let all Wall Street investors scold us. We insist that clients are No1, employees are No2 and shareholders should be No3."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked about Ma's 2009 comments, an Alibaba spokesman told the Post: "Shareholders are important and we respect them, but they come at No3 because they are the beneficiaries of doing No1 and No2 right."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to elaborate on its persistance in a partnership structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission has unveiled key conditions for companies seeking to list in the city with dual-share structures, marking a major step forward in reform of the listing rules designed to help Hong Kong compete with the US in attracting listings by technology firms and other innovative enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The conditions have high thresholds as the regulator does not plan to open the door too wide and allow too many companies to apply for such a shareholding structure, because the city does not allow class-action lawsuits to protect shareholders??interests, unlike the United States.The SFC still supports one share, one voteCarlson Tong, SFC chairman</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC only wants to allow certain types of newly listed, innovative companies to be eligible for dual-share structures, and only as long as they meet conditions the SFC considers important for shareholder protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said companies applying for dual-share structures would have to be restricted to firms whose founders held only small stakes but whose contributions or innovations were vital to the business, such as in technology firms. Companies with majority shareholders should not be allowed to have such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other conditions designed to ensure investor protection should include sunset provisions, so that the special shareholding structure would end in a certain number of years or when the founders sold their stakes or left the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC would support the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) carrying out a second phase of detailed consultation on dual-share structure reform if the exchange could address those issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC still supports one share, one vote,??Tong said. We do not plan to allow all companies to do it. However, we are not turning a deaf ear to market demand to enhance our market to compete with the US for new listings.??/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the first time the SFC had made its position clear on controversial listing reform proposals. HKEx is pushing for reforms to enable Hong Kong to maintain its position as a listing hub for mainland firms after the city lost some heavyweight technology firm listings to the US in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC is the city's ultimate market regulator and the HKEx reform proposal would need its approval. Its position appears to clear a major obstacle for the reform, with some market watchers saying it could be introduced in six months to a year. That could help attract many technology firms such as mobile phone maker Xiaomi to list in Hong Kong instead of the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx consulted the market last year on whether it should change listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure which it banned in 1989, after refusing to give Alibaba an exemption from the ban. The mainland e-commerce giant wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only held a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong. The SFC still believes no exemption should be given but supports rules with clear conditions for companies seeking to apply for such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba took its listing to New York, where dual-class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US had dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them were information technology companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class share structures allow one class of shareholder to have more rights than others. Many technology firms??founders sell stakes early on as they seek funding, resulting in them holding small stakes. They argue that dual-share structures protect their interests but many fund managers believe such structures are unfair because they would damage investor protection for small shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised on the Hong Kong stock market in 2017 dropped to the lowest in almost a decade as the city slipped down the global IPO league table.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just US$35 billion was raised during the year, down 15 per cent from 2016 and the smallest amount since the financial crisis in 2008, according to data from </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This was despite the benchmark Hang Seng Index rallying 34 per cent as of December 22, the strongest annual growth since 2009 at 52 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the surge in share prices has not translated to more new listings or post-listing fundraising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised - that includes the sum raised from initial public offerings, rights issues or placements on the stock market - was the lowest since 2008 when only US$20 billion was raised, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funds raised from IPO in Hong Kong dropped to US$13.87 billion, down 45 per cent from 2016. That is the smallest amount raised from IPO since 2012 when the total was US$11.28 billion, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong slipped to third in the worldwide IPO rankings this year, behind New York and Shanghai. The city was the No. 1 IPO market globally in both 2015 and 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest IPO in Hong Kong this year was China's </span><span class="s3">Guotai Junan Securities</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$2.2 billion (HK$17.2 billion), a long way off the US$7.6 billion raised by </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has to reform its listing regime to attract more large technology firms to list here. It is therefore good to see </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) propose letting dual-class shareholding structure companies list here next year,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a broker who is also the legislator representing the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, we have to insist any such changes must have shareholder protection safeguards in place.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX recently announced that from the middle of next year it will allow giant tech firms with multiple class share structures to list here, ending a ban that has been in place since the 1980s. Dual-class arrangements - permissible in US markets and popular with technology firms - allow one class of shareholders more voting rights or higher dividends than others.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New York took the lead in IPO funds raised, with US$29 billion in 2017, up 139.2 per cent from 2016. The massive increase was mainly because technology firm </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">, which has dual-class shares, chose New York for its US$3.9 billion IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also lost out to </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, which has raised US$18.9 billion, up 12.5 per cent from 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figures show that Hong Kong is failing to attract new technology companies. Only 6.9 per cent of the IPO funds raised here were from tech companies, a long way behind the 49 per cent that came from financial firms, 9.9 per cent from consumer products, 8.9 per cent from media and entertainment, 7.4 per cent from industrials and 7.1 per cent from health-care companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong ranked 10th worldwide in terms of tech IPOs, behind the likes of New York, Switzerland, South Korea and Shenzhen, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data showed.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A high-powered financial forum initiated by new Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and chaired by Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has discussed reforms to attract more new-economy companies to list on our stock market. It is a clear signal of the key part the direction of economic development is expected to play in Lam's first policy address next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new economy has already galvanised the traditional business rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore, which are both now playing catch-up to avoid being left behind. The island state may become the first Asian bourse to allow dual-class-share initial public offers - a reform also at the top of the agenda of the Hong Kong forum - in a bid to become a tech hub and a regional magnet for IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has also so far not allowed such listings, which enable founding shareholders to retain control with minority holdings by giving some shares more weight, because of worries about sidelining ordinary shareholders. But they have been on the city's mind ever since e-commerce giant Alibaba - owner of the Post - took its dual-class-share listing to New York after it was rejected by Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Time for Hong Kong to define the ‘new economy' amid talk of third board at stock exchange[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2105149/time-hong-kong-define-new-economy-amid-talk-third-board]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A recent public consultation on the controversial idea is reported to have revealed consensus among finance industry professionals on broadening the market and allowing dual-class shares on a third trading board that would also host start-ups with no profit record, but division on how to go about it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> both presented briefings and will do follow-up work before the forum reconvenes in the last quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have Asia's third-largest equity bourse by market capitalisation, but we face regional competitors who are prepared to undertake aggressive structural reforms in a bid to capture the opportunities offered by China's rise. If Hong Kong does not push forward and clings to old ways of doing business, it stands to miss out. In that respect it is good that in Lam's consultations ahead of her policy address, a recurring theme of her remarks has been the need to strike a balance between regulation to protect investors and development, in order to meet the needs of the new economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the development of the new economy, share structures can be quite different from traditional companies. As a result regulations are prone to become outdated. It is good to see the government set up this forum headed by the financial secretary to look into the issue. We trust economic policy will be a centrepiece of the policy address, and that the government will set some landmark direction on where Hong Kong is headed over the next five years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is garnering support towards creating a third board to attract technology start-ups and new economy firms. But safeguards on corporate governance, investor education and transparency in the downside risks are needed to ensure the success of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) has just completed a consultation over the proposed third board, but a second round of consultation on the detailed rules is still needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new third board will offer two markets, one for listing big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, which would open to all investors. The second board is for start-ups which would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main and GEM boards have adopted the one-share one-vote principle in the belief that a dual-class share structure can lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders. Venture capitalists and fund managers also tend to oppose to weighted voting rights as they reduce the price at which they can sell their shares relative to international peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But attitudes of Hong Kong regulators and some market participants are starting to shift, with focus turning to the development of the city's future competitiveness and the appropriate measures to safeguard investors' interests and mitigate governance risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX's proposals strive to address the market quality and risk profile concerns," said Nelson Tang, a partner in the corporate department of </span><span class="s3">Hogan Lovells</span><span class="s1">. "Clearer guidance however from the regulators is needed and a ‘one size fits all' approach should be avoided."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the suggested accelerated delisting regime may allow for quicker enforcement by the stock regulator, which is key to enhancing profitability and corporate governance if listed companies want to maintain their listed status while removing poor performers from the board, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board PRO will restrict access to professional investors only in trading start-ups lacking a financial track record. While this may address concerns that retail investors are perceived to be more vulnerable and less sophisticated, some may argue that a complete ban is an unfair deprivation of an opportunity to invest in these high growth companies. A more flexible approach could be explored by allowing retail investors to participate with additional safeguards in place, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators are also looking at the "primary equity connect" concept, an extended model of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes as an avenue to help with the liquidity of the new and current boards, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marketing and investor education will help make investors savvier when investing in the tech industry, and therefore enhance the appeal for those companies to list in Hong Kong, improving stock liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's proposed third board consultation comes amid the government's promotion on Hong Kong's role in the Lok Ma Chau loop project with Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area integration, which appears to be an effort in developing an innovative culture for education and investment of new economy companies in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Luke Waddington, chief executive of Hong Kong-based fintech Bluepool, says Hong Kong requires a more coherent regulatory framework and bigger government grants to create an innovation technology ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These companies [in Singapore] are on the path towards growing into a large company quickly that eventually aim to IPO. But I don't get the sense that is what has been happening in Hong Kong," Waddington said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He praised Singapore's model as making things much easier for start-ups, citing the ease with which funding can be raised, as well as the ability to exit an investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington added that Singapore has a more coherent regulatory framework designed to get different organisations to come together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore said earlier this year it was seeking public feedback on a suitable regulatory framework to allow the listing of dual-class structures. HKEX invited the public to submit their feedback on the proposed board under a deadline that ended earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore has also announced that it is replicating the UK model, linking the stock regulator with the central bank and businesses so that they can create funding and sandbox mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong has allocated resources to business incubators in Science Park and Cyberport overseen by bureaucrats with little entrepreneurial experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington said a better approach would be to give cash grants directly to entrepreneurs as small companies often struggle to cover the fees to meet licensing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the overall ecosystem can support innovative and new economy companies, then investors will understand why we need a third board and dual-share voting structure," Edward Au, co-leader National Public Offering Group at Deloitte said. "This spirit seems to be starting to develop in Hong Kong now."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has been the world's second largest initial public offering (IPO) market by value over the past two decades, driven mainly by the listing here of a swathe of mainland companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But there is one sector in particular that the market has largely failed to attract strong applicant interest from, technology and new economy companies, which continues to be dominated by New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data, Hong Kong was the world's largest IPO market by value last year, raising US$24.53 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 1997, the city languished in eighth place, when new listings were worth just US$5.7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the past two decades it has topped the global IPO list in 2015, and from 2009 to 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a running total, over those 20 years, some US$388 billion has been raised in Hong Kong up to the first quarter of 2017, ranking it second over that timescale to New York, which remains well ahead at US$675.8 billion raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/7c3dfdcc-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Arguably the missed listing that hurt officials in Hong Kong the most was that of mainland China e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which chose the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> to host the world's largest IPO to date, for US$25 billion in 2014. Alibaba now owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But on the flipside, Hong Kong has also scored notable victories over its Manhattan rival, hosting the world's second and third biggest floats: </span><span class="s3">Agricultural Bank</span><span class="s1"> of China's US$22.1 billion listing in 2010 and </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s US$21.96 billion offering in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Prior to 1997, the Hong Kong stock market was dominated by traditional Hong Kong-based companies, such as British conglomerates or local companies in the utilities, finance, real estate or trading sectors," said Johnson Chui, the managing director and head of Asia-Pacific equity capital markets at Credit Suisse.Prior to 1997, the Hong Kong stock market was dominated by traditional Hong Kong-based companies, such as British conglomerates or local companies in the utilities, finance, real estate or trading sectorsJohnson Chui, managing director and head of Asia-Pacific equity capital markets, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Today, it is an international hub, playing an important role of being the gateway to China."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese companies have dominated Hong Kong's IPO market, last year raising HK$156.6 billion in the city, representing 82 per cent of all listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By the end of 2016, 1,002 mainland Chinese firms were listed in Hong Kong, representing half the bourse's total 2,009 companies. They represented 63 per cent of the total market capitalisation and 69 per cent of turnover.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong will continue to play a leading role as an important gateway for Chinese companies to access international markets - but Hong Kong will need to adapt to the rapid changes taking place in the markets," Chui said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), which runs the stock exchange, on June 16 issued a public consultation on the proposal to launch a New Board, or the so-called Third Board - on top of the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (for growth companies that do not fulfil the requirements of profitability or track record) - with more flexible rules to attract tech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/83dad30c-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The New Board will have two markets - one for mega companies that match all the main board requirements but who cannot list here because they have dual-class stock structures, while the other will be for start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A dual-class structure refers to when a company issues various types of shares with different voting rights - favoured by many technology firms as their founders usually hold minority stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bans companies with such a structure while the US allows them to list, which is one reason why Hong Kong has previously lost out to some technology offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation process for the New Board will last for two months. If it gains enough support, the HKEX will issue a second consultation on detailed rules of the New Board which may then be launched sometime next year.Hong Kong's well-oiled IPO process and stable regulatory regimes are also key reasons why investors and Chinese companies favour the Hong Kong marketChristopher Laskowski, managing director and head of corporate and investment banking, Citi Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial firms still dominate the Hong Kong market with 69 per cent of the funds raised last year, while tech firms accounted for a mere 3 per cent, according to consulting firm PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gordon Tsui, the managing director of Hantec Pacific, has no doubt Hong Kong's role as a platform for raising funds for mainland companies will continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we have a biased profile for our IPO market. We focus very much on attracting Chinese companies - particularly mainland banks and brokers. We haven't done well in attracting international firms to list here."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, the chief executive at Capital Link International, said the ability of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares companies and attract technology firms are the key issues for Hong Kong's IPO market in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The exchange needs to be innovative and prove it can adapt and evolve as fast and efficiently as the companies they wish to attract to list. There is no upside to cutting-edge technology companies listing on outdated exchanges that have not recognised the times are changing," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/23/8826e5e0-5722-11e7-839c-33f85c43b72e_image_hires_203349.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Laskowski, the managing director and head of corporate and investment banking at Citi Hong Kong, says Chinese companies like to list in Hong Kong as they can gain access to international markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their numbers are increasing all the time via the two Stock Connect cross-border share-trading schemes, which allow mainlanders to buy stocks in listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through the schemes, the so-called Southbound investment represented 9 per cent of all Hong Kong turnover in the first quarter of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong's well-oiled IPO process and stable regulatory regimes are also key reasons why investors and Chinese companies favour the Hong Kong market," Laskowski said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Depending as strongly as the Hong Kong market does on mainland business, and being linked so inextricably with it, the city will naturally be affected by any slowdown of the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A number of corporate governance issues have arisen involving China companies although we believe they remain company specific, rather than market wide," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But as projects eventually become reality within the Chinese government's flagship "Belt and Road Initiative", which is dominated by the building and financing of infrastructure projects in some 65 countries, Laskowski is hopeful too that many of the companies involved will be looking to Hong Kong for their funding choices, ensuring its strong IPO traffic levels will continue unabated, and become even more diversified.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After being snubbed by mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba for its huge initial public offering, the city's financial officials have been engaged in serious soul-searching. As the IPO market is the lifeblood of the Hong Kong stock exchange, it's understandable its bosses want listing rules to be as competitive as those of premier investment hubs like New York and London to attract newcomers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stumbling block has been the long-standing "one share, one vote" rule, from which Alibaba had wanted to be exempted to retain control of its board membership. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> made the right decision not to bend the rule for Alibaba. But it does not mean the rule itself should not be reviewed and changed in future. This is why the exchange is now seeking public views on whether to allow potential listing companies to have special shareholding structures that would have allowed Alibaba to list in Hong Kong rather than New York. The exchange says it is keeping an open mind and does not have a fixed position.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation followed proposals made by the Financial Services Development Council, which included changing the rule for the main board or creating new boards for companies, especially hi-tech ones that tend to favour so-called dual-class share structures to retain management control. On the surface, "one share, one vote" seems fair and sensible. In reality, it does not really affect ordinary retail investors, who rarely accumulate a big enough stake in a company to make a difference. Such fights are usually between significant minority shareholders like fund managers and company management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The jury is still out on whether a dual-class structure is good or bad for shareholder returns. </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, Warren Buffett's </span><span class="s3">Berkshire Hathaway</span><span class="s1"> and London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> all have similar such share structures, and their returns speak for themselves. On the other hand, a joint </span><span class="s3">Wharton School</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Harvard Business School</span><span class="s1"> study found that while large ownership stakes in managers' hands tend to strengthen corporate performance, heavy voting control by insiders weakens it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It appears management quality is the key. If investors are buying into such companies, they are placing their trust in their managers for superior returns. Otherwise, they should avoid investing in them. But there is no reason why Hong Kong investors should not have this choice.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji recruited then Hong Kong securities regulator Laura Cha Shih May-lung to help bring order to the mainland's unruly emerging stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Seventeen years later, she is now responsible for overseeing implementation of reforms to ensure the local bourse is the No 1 destination for mainland company listings, ahead of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore and New York. Cha, 68, nominated enhancement of the city's competitiveness as her greatest challenge after the board of directors of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> elected her as its chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This reflected the greatest regret of retiring chairman Chow Chung-kong - the failure of the bourse to land the US$25 billion initial public offering of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, now owner of the South China Morning Post, in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba listed in New York because its dual-class share structure was not then accepted in Hong Kong under the principle of one share, one vote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This prompted debate culminating in the introduction this week of the biggest listing reforms in 25 years, including the acceptance of applications from companies with dual-class shares, and from biotechnology firms that have no record of generating revenue and therefore would not meet the financial eligibility tests of the main board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A mere politician will never dare to say so,” Ma said. “Alibaba will take this message. We will definitely consider Hong Kong's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We hope we can further invest in Hong Kong and enhance our participation in the city's economy.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam's invitation came after the passing of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposal to allow companies offering different classes of shares with different voting power to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Now I hope Alibaba can come back to list in Hong Kong,” Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the stock exchange had decided to start allowing the dual-class share system in midyear, and described allowing the system as a form of economic innovation.I have never been as confident in Hong Kong as todayJack Ma</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said the move would encourage more companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The passing of the system follows local authorities' rejection of a plan by Alibaba in 2014 to adopt a structure that would allow Ma to appoint more than half of the company's board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures, while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the ceremony, Ma said he first met Lam in the chief executive's office and talked with her for about 20 minutes, during which time they discussed the rejection, as well as how to encourage young start-ups.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I believe the passing of the dual-class share system will bring great changes and will help Hong Kong greatly in its future reforms,” he said. “I have never been as confident in Hong Kong as today.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma said there were many young talented people in Hong Kong and he urged them to find more opportunities on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam said she believed the city could nurture entrepreneurs like Ma and invited Ma to share his innovation experiences with local young people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and Lam have met each other more than once before.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August, Ma met Lam at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province. During the meeting, Ma offered to play a bigger role in helping Hong Kong develop a “more fashionable”, cashless society, by taking advantage of Alibaba's growing data clouding and e-payment systems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November in Hong Kong, at the grand finale of Alibaba's start-up competition, Jumpstarter 2017, the pair chatted about how Hong Kong could attract technology talents from the outside and how local talent can take advantage of opportunities elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In her first policy address in October, Lam said she would lead a new high-level interdepartmental steering committee on innovation and technology, and emphasised the importance of Hong Kong becoming a “smart city” to maintain its global competitiveness.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange reclaimed its crown as the No 1 IPO market in the world in 2018, beating last year's winner New York, as listing reforms led to the highest fundraising in eight years, according to Refinitiv data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main board had a 17.6 per cent share of the global IPO market this year as of December 21, with 125 companies raising US$36.5 billion. This was the highest since 2010 and up 175.5 per cent from last year, according to the data provider formerly known as </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on the other hand saw 64 IPOs raising US$28.9 billion, accounting for 13.9 per cent of the global IPO market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong was the No 1 IPO market in 2015 and 2016, the city mainly attracted traditional manufacturing firms and financial companies, with few tech companies listing here as they preferred New York and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In terms of TMT (telecommunications, media and technology) listings, Hong Kong came second after Tokyo in its highest ranking ever in this category.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest reforms in 25 years allowing dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list proved to be a major driving force in boosting tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class or weighted voting rights shareholding companies allow founders and key management greater say than other shareholders. These are favoured by many technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> and others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms launched by the bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April attracted two dual-class shareholding companies: the world's fourth largest smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in its July listing, and food delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> with its US$4.9 billion IPO in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobile tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion IPO - the largest IPO in Hong Kong this year - was also tech related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overall TMT IPOs raised US$15.7 billion, up 605.5 per cent from 2017 while the number grew 94.4 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tokyo's rise to third place in the IPO league table this year was also due to its ability to draw tech plays with US$24.5 billion in proceeds. This was mainly due to Softbank mobile unit's US$23.3 billion jumbo IPO this month - Japan's largest ever IPO and the world's second largest after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion fundraising in New York in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Japanese conglomerate owns stakes in e-commerce giant Alibaba and ride-sharing companies Uber and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, among others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Telecommunications and hi-tech were the two biggest fundraising sectors in Hong Kong this year, representing 39 per cent of funds raised, compared to 10 per cent in 2017. The financial sector, traditionally the largest sector in Hong Kong, this year represented just 9.5 per cent of all fundraising, compared to 32 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised from Hong Kong's equity capital markets - share placements, rights issues and IPOs - stood at US$64.2 billion in 2018, up 80 per cent year on year. It was also the highest after US$91.7 billion raised in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The listing reform has attracted many big players to list in Hong Kong but it was at the expense of lowering our corporate governance standards,” said Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner of </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1">. "The HKEX will need to introduce more measures to enhance investor protection.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said Hong Kong's IPO market will face pressure from Shanghai when it launches its new tech board in 2019, as China's financial capital will be competing for the same group of unicorns as Hong Kong and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accounting and consulting firm </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> said that it expects IPOs to decline by HK$100 billion (US$12.7 billion) next year amid market uncertainties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at global law firm Dechert, said that unless issues surrounding the global markets - the US-China trade war, Brexit and political unrest in certain parts of Europe - are resolved, Hong Kong will see a noticeable slowdown in IPO activity next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, the first unprofitable early-stage biotechnology company to list in Hong Kong under revised rules, rose on debut on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the Chinese maker of HIV, cancer and liver disease drugs, gained as much as 6.4 per cent from the initial public offering price to HK$14.90 in morning trading. The Hangzhou-drug maker posted a net loss of 86.9 million yuan (US$12.8 million) last year, according to its prospectus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Given it is the first biotech stock under the new listing regime to debut, some retail investors would find it an attractive speculative bet,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director of VC Asset Management, noting the stock had traded as high as HK$15.6 in the grey market earlier. “This is despite the recent product quality scandals in the pharmaceutical sector … stock investors tend to have short memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the listing reform has attracted biotechnology and other technology firms to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Biotechnology firms and other innovative industry have a lot of room of development,” Li said after attending the listing ceremony of Ascletis on Wednesday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the HKEX would continue to work with the mainland regulator to allow the dual class shareholding companies to be able to be traded by the mainlanders via the stock connects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1"> is the latest company to draw the attention of investors after the low profile debut of smartphone maker Xiaomi, after the city's stock exchange loosened the listing rules to entice more hi-tech companies by allowing unprofitable companies and those with dual-class structures to float shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi dropped 1.2 per cent on its first day of trading on July 9 before traders boosted buying of the stock on bets that the shares were undervalued. The stock was trading at HK$17.58 on Wednesday morning, 4.6 per cent above its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong, which is struggling to defend its title as a financial hub in Asia, is facing increasing competition from the Chinese mainland and even Singapore in wooing the listings of companies with the fastest earnings growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China's securities regulator has introduced Chinese depositary receipts to attract companies like </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Singapore Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has also started to accept companies with dual-class structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/01/6364db8c-953c-11e8-acb0-2eccab85240c_image_hires_115622.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of a wider listing rules revamp that took effect on April 30, biotechnology firms without profit or even revenue are allowed to apply for a listing on Hong Kong's stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, seven biotech firms have so far submitted applications to list under the new rules, including Nasdaq-listed Chinese cancer treatments developer </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1">, which is the first to apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> currently has 38 listed biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The level of interest - eight having submitted formal application - has been higher than my expectation,” said Charles Chau Chi-chung, a partner at law firm </span><span class="s3">Jones Day</span><span class="s1">, who is helping biotech clients prepare listings in Hong Kong. “Earlier I expected five to be listed by the end of this year, now I would not be surprised if eight to 10 will make their market debut by then. So far, the listing candidates that have submitted applications tend to be relatively more established companies within the sector ... they are also careful in their choice of sponsors to ensure success.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The international tranche - accounting for 90 per cent - of Ascletis' HK$2.98 billion shares offer was only 1.17 times subscribed, while its Hong Kong public offer - 10 per cent of the total - was eight times oversubscribed. It priced its shares at HK$14, the middle of an indicative range of HK$12 to HK$16.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures that list on the Hong Kong bourse under its new listing rules will join the Hang Seng Composite Index so that they can be traded by mainland Chinese and international investors through the Stock Connect schemes, the index compiler, Hang Seng Indexes Company, said on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first such company is likely to be Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which filed for a listing in Hong Kong last week that could be the world's biggest flotation since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion debut in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such companies would not join the benchmark Hang Seng Index for now, the compiler said, meaning passive fund investors that track the Hang Seng Index would not be able to trade in them as they only buy companies in the benchmark index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision, which comes just after the bourse operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), unveiled reforms to allow companies with dual-shareholding structures to list on the exchange for the first time, will be subject to a review at an unspecified time in the future, according to the index compiler.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform aims to attract more technology firms to list, but we also need to achieve a balance of market concerns … there are fund mangers who have expressed concern that they would be forced to buy into these stocks if they are included in the benchmark,” said Vincent Kwan, director and general manager of Hang Seng Indexes Company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We would need to wait for more companies with dual shareholding structures to list here and monitor their trading patterns before we can decide on what conditions we should impose for them to be qualify to be included in Hang Seng Index,” Kwan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huge number of Chinese tech unicorns likely to IPO in Hong Kong in 2018, says JPMorgan Asia-Pacific chief[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144880/huge-number-chinese-tech-unicorns-likely-ipo-hong-kong-2018-says]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding allows founders or key management to own a premium class of shares which gives them voting rights over other shareholders.Such structures are popular among tech firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, but the Hong Kong bourse's previous refusal to allow such structures had seen it lose out as a choice of IPO destination.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, some local fund managers have expressed concern that companies with such structures do not follow the one-share one-vote principle that previously defined Hong Kong's listing rules. This has led some of them, particularly passive fund managers that track the major indices, to urge the index compiler not to add these firms into the Hang Seng Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index covers the top 50 largest blue chips, while Hang Seng Composite Index has 483 constituent stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is good to see dual-class shareholding companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index so as to allow mainland Chinese to invest via the Stock Connect schemes,” saidChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's stock brokers. The Stock Connect schemes link the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, allowing both onshore and offshore investors to trade in all three markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he urged the index compiler to consider quickly including such firms in the Hang Seng Index, as they are taking important roles in the local economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Excluding them would mean less fund managers would invest in them and hence the liquidity of stock trading would be affected, as would the competitiveness of Hong Kong in trying to attract these companies to list here,” Cheung said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another pillar of the listing reform was to allow biotechnology firms that have yet to generate any revenue to list in Hong Kong, an effort to capture part of a growing industry. However the compiler will not consider including such firms in any major index for now, Kwan said, after some investors raised concerns over risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These biotech companies are new to Hong Kong investors. We need time to study their trading patterns before including them in major indices,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One week after the launch of the new listing rules, only Xiaomi has submitted an application, in contrast to market expectations of about a dozen firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to support the new economy and tech companies after missing out on opportunities such as the listing of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and the development of leading Chinese drone maker DJI, chief executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Tuesday in an interview at the RISE conference in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We learned the lesson when we lost the Hong Kong listing of Alibaba in 2014 to the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, as back then our listing rules didn't allow dual class shareholdings,” said Lam, referring to the market debut of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, which this week became the first dual-class stock listed on the Hong Kong bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government's new listing rules, which took effect in April, accept formal applications under a system that permits dual-class shares - a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders. “We are making listing rules more in step with the new economy … because the world is changing and to stay competitive and on top, we need to continuously revisit our rules and regulations to adapt to the new changes,” said Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the city hopes to bring tech companies to Hong Kong's capital markets, Lam also stressed the government's efforts to retain talent and nurture its own tech start-ups, after the city missed out on the opportunity to nurture further growth of the world's largest maker of recreational drones, DJI, whose founder Wang Tao, an alumnus of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">, moved to Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sellers' remorse? Xiaomi's shares soar on second day[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2154566/xiaomi-surges-9pc-after-fastest-ever-inclusion-hang-seng]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The case of DJI reflects Hong Kong's strength in basic research and good universities,” Lam said. “Of course to translate research into practical technology applications, we need more support, whether it's incubation support, venture capital or lab space.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its most recent budget, the Hong Kong government pledged to set aside an additional HK$50 billion to support innovation and technology development this financial year, especially in the areas of biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI), smart cities and fintech, in addition to a HK$10 billion commitment to support the industries from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam stressed that Hong Kong's involvement in the Greater Bay Area, China's scheme for more economic integration between the city, Macau and southern Chinese cities in Guangdong province, would put tech companies like DJI in a place more accessible to research and development capability and venture capital in Hong Kong, as well as the huge manufacturing base of neighbouring cities in Guangdong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Greater Bay Area[https://www.scmp.com/infographics/article/2088829/chinas-greater-bay-area-integration-scheme], which encompasses 65 million people, is currently home to some of China's biggest technology companies, including Tencent, </span><span class="s3">Huawei</span><span class="s1"> and DJI in Shenzhen. With a combined economy about three times the size of the San Francisco Bay Area, it is expected to surpass the Greater Tokyo and New York areas by 2030 with a GDP of US$4.62 trillion and become a world-class centre for advanced manufacturing, innovation, international shipping, finance and trade, according to the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a government think tank.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To fit into this plan to create a world-class technology hub, Hong Kong has pledged to foster exchanges on innovation and technology with other cities in the area.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out to Singapore in a survey of regional corporate governance standards because it still does not have an independent audit regulator, according to a joint report by CLSA and the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Corporate Governance Watch 2016 is a biannual study that tracks the corporate governance of more than 1,000 companies across 12 Asia-Pacific markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia, which was included in the survey for the first time, was ranked top with a total score of 78.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore grabbed the second spot with a score of 67, nudging ahead of Hong Kong on 65. Mainland China ranked tenth in the report on 45, ahead of the Philippines on 38 and Indonesia on 36.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong topped the last survey, in 2014, and was also placed first in 2007. Singapore has come out on top in five of the last seven surveys, before Australia was included.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results are based on a survey of fund managers and institutional investors to give scores that evaluate accounting and auditing, corporate governance culture, enforcement and regulatory environment, and corporate governance rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the launch of the report on Thursday, Jamie Allen, secretary general of ACGA, said Hong Kong lost out mainly due to the lack of an independent body to handle the regulation of auditors. The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1">, an industry body, currently acts as the regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government wants to shift regulatory responsibility to the independent Financial Reporting Council, but this is unlikely to happen until 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Singapore's accounting and auditing standards are of a high quality and policed by an effective regulator in the </span><span class="s3">Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority</span><span class="s1">,” according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen said: “Hong Kong, India and Philippines are the three last markets not yet to have independent audit regulators.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Singapore's recent decision to consider allowing companies with dual-class shares to raise funds on the stock exchange may lead to a decline in its corporate governance standing, he said.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong got a high corporate governance rating as its securities regulator says a firm ‘no' to dual class shares, which violate the ‘one share, one vote' principle. Many institutional investors will discount a market if there is dual-share structure,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong lost out on the world's largest IPO two years ago when mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba opted to list on the New York stock exchange which allows dual-share structures. Hong Kong banned dual-class shares in the mid 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, was denied an exemption in Hong Kong that would have allowed senior executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only owned minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a different legal system and regulation to the US. We cannot allow dual-share structure here just because the US is doing it,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he supports the listing reforms proposed jointly by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, which suggest setting up two new committees with equal representation from both sides. One committee would set listing policies while the other would approve complicated new listing applications.We cannot allow dual-share structure here [in Hong Kong] just because the US is doing itJamie Allen, secretary general, ACGA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allen disagrees with opponents of the reform who say it would hand too much power to the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said: “There are many new listings that have corporate governance problems, and the listing reform would help address the problem and enhance market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It would be better to let the SFC be the sole regulator for listing matters, but it would take a long-term debate for that to happen. The proposed reform would at least be the first step to allow the SFC to work closely with the HKEX to handle listing regulation.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another corporate governance weakness in Hong Kong, he said, is the fact there are too few women on company boards. Only 11 per cent of directors are female in Hong Kong, well below the 17 per cent to 43 per cent seen in overseas markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has a lot of smart women. It is a question of why so few women are on the board,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA's global head of thematic research, Shaun Cochran, said the firm's survey of 1,047 companies showed that those with good corporate governance tend to outperform the others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our analysis shows that better governance is associated with better fundamentals,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, accounting firm PwC on Thursday released their own corporate governance report onOur analysis shows that better governance is associated with better fundamentalsShaun Cochran, CLSA</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed companies. It showed that Hang Seng Index (HSI) constituents stocks - the largest 50 blue chips in Hong Kong - on average had adopted better disclosure practices and new corporate governance rules than H-share companies, which are constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Chinese Enterprise Index (HSCEI).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The PwC Hong Kong's Risk Assurance division collected and analysed the data of 230 listed companies in the HSI and HSCEI, across sectors including financial services, real estate, retail and technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The study found 86 per cent of HSI-listed companies were early adopters of new disclosure requirements relating to internal control and risk management systems, compared to 60 per cent of HSCEI-listed entities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One of the reasons that HSI constituents perform better is because substantial emphasis and resources are put into risk management and internal control areas to respond to market expectations and regulatory changes,” said Kanus Yue, PwC Hong Kong Risk Assurance Partner. “The majority of HSI constituents have made an effort to increase their voluntary disclosure beyond the level of mere compliance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This greater transparency and the additional information disclosed helps investors to analyse the overall risk profiles of the companies and facilitates more informed investment decisions.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To cement Hong Kong's position as a financial hub, there is consensus that its stock market could do with reforms to its listing and fundraising regime to enhance both its appeal to start-ups and new economy companies, and protection for investors. But it is now confirmed that reforms will not include the bigger role sought by the market watchdog, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC). This comes after 94 per cent of about 8,500 respondents representing companies, brokers and finance professionals opposed involving the SFC in the early stages of the listing process. In watered down listing reforms announced after a market consultation, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) retains its primary role in approving company listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It remains important, however, to strike a balance between the SFC's concern with investor protection issues such as financial discipline and the quality of companies, and HKEX's need to make the market more attractive for listings by start-ups and new economy companies. In the face of aggressive competition from rival bourses, it was good to hear the secretary for financial services and the treasury, James Lau, say all three parties are open minded about this.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New market for dual-class shares garners momentum after watered down listing reforms[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2111438/new-market-dual-class-shares-garners-momentum-after-watered]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stakes are high. Hong Kong may have been the world's top initial public offering market last year, but financial industry companies were responsible for 59 per cent of funds raised, while technology plays raised the equivalent of 0.8 per cent. In the first half of this year, a lack of new technology offerings saw the city slide to third place for IPOs behind New York and Shanghai. New share sales fell nearly 20 per cent in the six-month period to US$5.6 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This cannot continue if Hong Kong is to avoid losing its status as an international hub. The need to attract more start-ups and new economy firms is paramount. That said, the watered down reforms may clear the way for progress towards this goal by allowing firms with dual-class shares to list on a third board with more relaxed rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market. Dual-class shares enable founders and managers to exercise control at the cost of minority shareholder rights, raising accountability concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There remains the problem of a conflict of interest between HKEX, as a for-profit company listed on its own main board, and its quasi-regulatory role, given that IPOs account for a large part of its revenue. However, the SFC's retention of its role in setting listing policies, plus representation on a panel to support the listing committee, should enable it to stand up for a more effective role in investor protection. It also could go some way towards finding a balance that would counter the perception of conflict of interest without burdening the market with more regulation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's equity capital markets have put in a strong performance for the first nine months of the year, raising almost 45 per cent more than in the period last year. However, many in the market are still focused on what could have been.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s record-breaking initial public offering in the US this month has added impetus to a push for the city to re-examine whether the stock exchange operator should change its listing rules to enable the kind of dual-class share structure that the e-commerce giant had sought for a Hong Kong listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, companies raised US$40.9 billion in Hong Kong's equity markets in the year to September, including IPOs, follow-on deals and convertible bond offerings, a 44.4 increase from the year-earlier period, according to preliminary data by Thomson Reuters. The nine-month haul represents 88 per cent of the capital raised for all of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Follow-on deals, in which listed companies issue new shares to the public and block trades, dropped 26.5 per cent year on year to US$21.2 billion for the period, despite Citic Pacific raising US$6.9 billion in August for its asset injection deal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is undergoing a transitional period in which the Chinese city needs to recover quickly from the loss of Alibaba's flotation, the most important event in recent listing history," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY in Hong Kong. He is keen to see more private-sector listings after most state-owned enterprises - a one-timer pillar of the city's IPO market - have gone public over the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised US$25 billion in its New York listing, making it the world's biggest IPO, valuing the firm at about US$250 billion based on the first day's trade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Debate over the way Hong Kong handled Alibaba's proposed listing structure has continued to simmer. On one side are those who argue the city should have shown flexibility in accommodating Alibaba's wish for a dual-class share arrangement. Countering that view are defenders of the status quo who say the exchange was right to not bend its rules for the sake of one company, fearing the consequences for investor protection in the absence of US-style class-action lawsuits. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> began consultations on a rule change at the end of last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong lost Alibaba, it did welcome an influx of mainland private companies listing their shares. These firms are drawn to the city to avoid a cumbersome regulatory approval process at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, a number of these small share sales sparked concerns over the quality of the mainland companies coming to the market. Ding Hui, the chairman of retailer Fujian Nuoqi, went missing after transferring HK$291 million in cash out of the company's accounts, soon after Nuoqi's January IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong also suffered the embarrassment of missing out on a wave of Chinese internet companies that bypassed the city for listings in the US. JD.com China's second-largest e-commerce firm, raised US$2 billion in New York, and social network platform Weibo raised US$286 million in a US public offering, partly due again to the dual-class issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The consultation now under way over a change to the listing rules comes as the city's exchange tries to play catch-up with its US counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But some market professionals are prepared to look beyond the Alibaba setback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mathias Helleu, chairman of 8 Securities, said: "We do not think sentiment in Hong Kong has been dented after the Alibaba IPO listing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, chief executive of Cathay Conning Asset Management, said: "Missing out on Alibaba IPO only had a very temporary impact on the HK stock market sentiment."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebecca Chan, a partner at </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">, said economic concerns in China and the US Federal Reserve's plan to end its bond-buying programme could affect the listing market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first nine months, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> remained the top performer in the Hong Kong equity capital markets, followed by </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung said he supports proposals to launch a new board for start-ups on the stock exchange, as he turns his attention to helping students to carry out research in financial technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, whose 10-year career as a minister comes to an end on Friday, will return to where he came from - </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1">. He told the Post he has no title yet but the job would involve research and teaching related to fintech.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government a decade ago, he was dean of business management at the university.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When I first joined the government, I planned to work for a term of five years only, but eventually I served two terms and have worked for 10 years. It is time to make a change in my career," said Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan, 60, now plans to focus on fintech related research and study in an effort to encourage more youngsters to innovate and develop technologies that will help banks, brokers and insurance companies to do business and provide better services more securely and at a cheaper cost.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hopes this kind of research will encourage more young people to establish their own start-ups. Chan's move comes at a time when proposals by the stock exchange to establish a new board to help start-ups raise funds are under consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I would support the stock exchange in introducing a new board to attract start-ups and dual-share structure companies to list in Hong Kong as long as they could introduce investor protection measures to safeguard the interests of the investors," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) issued a consultation paper two weeks ago proposing a third board - in addition to the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market - which would have more flexible rules to attract ‘new economy' companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board would offer two markets - one for mega listings of big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, the other for start-ups. Both would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the latter case, Chan said the reason for this restriction on the type of investor is because "the start-up markets are risky."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the board designed for dual-class structure companies, he said if it allowed retail investors to trade, measures should be put in place to protect the investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding structures are favoured by technology giants such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> as their founders own a minority stake but want to maintain control. They issuance of two classes of shares allows the founders more voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Singapore and some other markets have this sunset clause for the dual-class shares structure to protect the interests of investors," said Chan.Hong Kong is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbiChan Ka-keung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Before joining the government, Chan had spent his entire career in academia. After winning a scholarship in Hong Kong at the age of 18, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from </span><span class="s3">Wesleyan University</span><span class="s1">, and both his MBA and PhD in finance from the </span><span class="s3">University of Chicago</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He taught for nine years at </span><span class="s3">Ohio State University</span><span class="s1">, before taking up a role at the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</span><span class="s1"> in 1993, eventually becoming dean of business management. He joined the government as secretary for financial services and the treasury in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back over his past decade as a minister, he is most proud of promoting the yuan business in Hong Kong and overseeing the launch of the two stock connect schemes linking HKEX with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is a leading offshore yuan centre. It is going to continue to play an important role in China's internationalisation of renminbi. The two stock connects have promoted cross-border trading and enhanced Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s proposed third board to draw technology and new economy firms to list in the city has received a general welcome from market players, but it is too soon to tell how big a draw it will become.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board announced by the exchange in a consultation paper on Friday limits listings to technology and new economy companies, and is intended to plug the gap that the bourse's main board and the Growth Enterprise Market have not been able to fill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The board will consist of two markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The premium market will target large companies that match requirements for the main board but have a dual shareholding structure. US-listed firms with dual share structures can apply for a secondary listing, and retail investors will be allowed to trade in this market.</span></p>

It will have a low entry threshold and light regulatory touch. To segregate the good and poor quality companies, a delisting mechanism will be in place. Firms will be delisted if they failed to meet certain operation requirement, if their share prices fell to a certain threshold, or if they had been suspended from trading for 90 days. This market will only be opened to institutional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of HKEX said that overseas-listed Chinese companies with dual class structure currently banned from listing in Hong Kong, could now opt for a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"For the longer term, there is no reason why Hong Kong could not attract some big US technology and new economy companies to consider a secondary listing," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he acknowledged that it will be an uphill task as the US is already the largest technology market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the new board will adopt an "easy in, easy out" approach, Li stressed that "the new board will not become a farm of shell companies".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/6affea34-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]The new board's limitation to tech firms and start-ups aim to achieve what the Growth Enterprise Market was originally intended for when it launched in 1999, targeting the very same types of firms. Eventually, only 18 per cent of GEM firms have links to information technology, while 29 per cent operate in the consumer and services sector and 26 per cent are construction companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was the top IPO market worldwide last year but only 3 per cent of funds raised were for technology companies. Five technology firms listed in Hong Kong last year, raising HK$5.7 billion (US$730 million), while the nine GEM technology companies raised only HK$800 million, far below </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">'s HK$15.9 billion, New York's HK$8.7 billion and Shenzhen ChiNext's HK$7.9 billion, according to PwC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here's what different market players say about the third board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX plans third new board for new economy firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2098670/hkex-plans-third-new-board-new-economy-firms]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">START-UPS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Start-ups welcome the board but are uncertain if they would list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lufax</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">'s internet lending and wealth management provider, Lufax is planning a listing, but is undecided on which market to IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are open-minded about the listing of Lufax. There is no concrete timetable and listing venue about the listing yet," said a spokeswoman of Ping An.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast Education</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alex Lee, a former banker who co-founded online education platform Mast Education with his mother and partners in late 2015, said he relied on his personal savings for start-up funding. While he welcomed the idea of the third board as a new fund-raising channel, his company may not opt for an offering soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Overall, it would be a good move for Hong Kong to have a new third board with the purpose to help start-ups and other new economy companies to raise funds. This would hopefully encourage more Hong Kong young people to set up their own businesses," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mast, which aims to provide high school students with university-level courses to boost their learning and be prepared for examinations, has been in operation for nearly two years. It has attracted more than 1,000 users globally, with a large proportion of them from the US, Hong Kong and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lee said he would wait out till his business was bigger before considering a listing on the third board or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xero</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rod Drury, chief executive and founder of Xero in New Zealand, said unlike Xero which floated in its first year, it was rare for a start-up to go public within a year of being founded. The firm uses cloud technology to help small and medium-sized enterprises better manage their accounting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We did everything backwards. Listed first, then brought in funding from hedge funds and venture funds including </span><span class="s3">Accel</span><span class="s1">, Matrix and TVC," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He recalled that there were few options in New Zealand to secure private capital for a technology start-up when the company was set up in 2006. He and other co-founders funded the firm out of their own pockets, and then listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (</span><span class="s3">NZX</span><span class="s1">) in the first year, followed by the </span><span class="s3">Australian Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">ASX</span><span class="s1">) in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As a technology start-up that went public within our first year, we encourage exchanges and others who offer capital raising options to consider how best they can support high growth businesses like ours with options for capital to support growth," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Drury is supportive of the idea of a third board as Xero's own listing has helped the company expand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">JabJabX</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Yue, who founded JabJabX, an app that stores and analyses data to help users hone their technique in Chinese martial arts, said he and his co-founders tapped on their personal savings of about HK$400,000 to set up the company earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He would wait for the details of the third board before deciding if it would seek a listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We do not need to rush to go public because we could find some angel investors or funds who share our mission to become our investors. We would like investors who can provide guidance to us to develop our business and to allow us to access to their network of contacts," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Listing on the stock exchange would help us to raise funds but it could not help us to expand our network. At present, the cost of bank interest rate remains low, so it is not hard to find low cost of funding," Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BROKERS AND FUND MANAGERS</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers said Alipay - the payment arm of a unit of the </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> - and Lufax, an internet finance arm of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which are considering listings could be potential candidates for the third board's premium market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange had two years ago tabled the proposal to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but was quickly rejected by the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC). This time around, the SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said they had agreed to the consultation as the listings would be limited to the new board, compared with the previous proposal that applied to the entire market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/60a5aa7e-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]Still, the dual shareholding structure will remain an issue of contention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong Investments Funds Association, the industry body of fund houses in Hong Kong, is opposed to such a structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In principle, investment managers believe that "one share one vote" is a cornerstone of investor protection," said Sally Wong, chief executive of HKIFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As for the discussion about the proposed third board, we should not view this in silos, but take a holistic approach and consider the relationships between the different boards. For example, will a third board listed company be "upgraded" to the main board? Or from the start-ups to the "premium" class? If yes, what are the exit or entry mechanisms," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brett McGonegal, chief executive of Capital Link International said the attempt to draw sought-after technology companies to list in Hong Kong had two audiences to placate including the companies and public investor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the balance between the two was not easy to strike, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Voting control through a dual class listing system does not translate into risk nor impropriety. However, the exchange needs to make sure the individual investor's interests are both aligned and protected. The old expression buyer beware cannot be the basis of a regulatory protection campaign because nothing is more paramount in the list of priorities," McGonegal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Mobius, executive chairman for Templeton Emerging Markets Group, who manages US$26 billion for clients in emerging markets including Hong Kong and mainland China, said he fully supported the HKEX consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A third listing board will give an opportunity for fintech and innovative companies to compete in Hong Kong and share in the success of Shenzhen's ChiNext which has been successful in raising capital for this rapid growing sector of our industry," Mobius said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe dual class shares if structured appropriately, that is where all the rights to the shareholders are commonly shared, will be beneficial to the market as it should allow enterprising companies listed overseas to dually list in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/06/16/660f409c-526d-11e7-b896-7f2d3a4d650b_image_hires_220023.jpg]ANALYSTS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXECUTIVES</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Defining technology firms and the corporate governance that entails would be the issues to address, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The third board concept would be a good idea to attract more technology companies to list but how to define a firm as a technology or new economy firm may be controversial. If a company is conducting online lending services, is it considered as a traditional financial firm or a new technology company?" said Joseph Tong Tang, chairman of Morton Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Keith Pogson, a senior partner of EY, said Hong Kong needed to diversify its IPO portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many challenges to the Hong Kong market," Pogson said. "We need to be responsive to the changing financing needs of the market. However this needs to be done in an investor friendly and robust way, as at the bedrock of Hong Kong's success is the quality of process and governance that Hong Kong can bring," Pogson said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We need to ensure that are market is ready for changing business models, that we understand markets such as technology, fintech, infrastructure and other evolving financing needs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mark Konyn, group chief investment officer of AIA Group, said international exchanges were competing to attract new listings as the capital markets and the finance industry integrate globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Creating new boards to attract companies under reduced levels of governance and less onerous listing requirements is a hot topic and one that needs to balance the commercial opportunity for the bourse itself and access opportunities for local investors with investor protection and oversight," Konyn said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technology driven businesses have access to many funding sources and international stock exchanges are keen not miss out on what is widely expected to continue to be a dominant sector for growing market capitalisation."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing reforms that would increase the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s power in listing matters are likely to join the list of failed reforms, after they were resoundingly rejected by most of the respondents to a consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposals in a joint consultation paper by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> and the SFC centred on establishing two committees - one for policy and one for regulatory issues - on top of the existing listing committee, with equal representation by the SFC and HKEX, to approve complicated new listings and set listing policies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This would upend the current structure whereby HKEX's listing division staff give preliminary approval to a listing and can suggest listing rule changes, which are then submitted to the 28-member listing committee of accountants, lawyers, executives of listed firms and fund managers for final approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposals</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">for fear that the change would allow the SFC to overregulate. As they have in past reforms, the listed companies again led the opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the stiff opposition, the reforms would be difficult to proceed without any modification, and the current deadlock is not a first. Previous failures in the past 15 years have ranged from delisting, quarterly reporting and restrictions on cornerstone investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Here are the reforms that were proposed and why they failed:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Companies to report results every three months instead of every six months, in line with international practice</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Plan was abandoned one year later after public consultation drew strong opposition from companies, including blue chips such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">. They argued that it would increase costs and prompt the management to chase short-term profits</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: Move to delist companies trading below 50 HK cents for a full month</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: HK$10 billion in value was wiped off the market a day after the consultation paper was released as investors rushed to dump penny stocks. HKEX scrapped the public consultation exercise four days later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government accepted an expert group's report on the penny-stock fiasco and decided to shift the listing division and regulatory powers from HKEX to the SFC and remove the conflict of interest of HKEX as a listed company and regulator</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Stiff opposition from companies, brokers and those who feared the change would enable the SFC to become too powerful. The government backtracked and abandoned the plan one month later</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: The government wanted to add part of the listing rules into the law; companies and directors that failed to disclose price-sensitive information could face a maximum 10-year jail term and a fine of HK$10 million</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: With strong opposition from companies and fears of the SFC becoming too powerful, the plan was dropped. In 2010, the government proposed that breaches could be a civil offence with a maximum fine of HK$8 million. The law was supported and enacted in 2013</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce quarterly results reporting in two phases: bigger firms with a market capitalisation of at least HK$10 billion would start in September 2008 while smaller ones would do it in September</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan was dropped after stiff opposition from companies, including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX attempted to restrict tycoons or certain investors from becoming cornerstone investors in initial public offerings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The plan received stiff opposition from tycoons and investment banks. The regulation has not been tightened and cornerstone investors still have a place in numerous listings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX wanted to introduce the British style of quarterly reporting in 2009 where companies give only broad performance outlines. In 2011, it wanted companies to follow the US style of quarterly reporting with more detailed numbers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: The proposals were dropped after stiff opposition from the companies including many blue chips</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought to extend the period banning directors from trading shares from two months in a year to up to seven months</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: More than 200 listed companies voiced their opposition with an open letter published in newspapers</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX sought views on whether dual-class share structures should be introduced after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> opted for a listing in New York over Hong Kong</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Mixed views were received. HKEX in June 2015 launched a second round of consultation to allow big companies to have dual-class structures, but SFC banned it a week later. HKEX said it would launch a consultation in the second quarter of 2017 to introduce a third board to attract technology firms and other new economy firms, which would allow dual-class share structure firms to list</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proposal: HKEX and the SFC jointly issue a consultation paper to allow SFC to take more front-line role in listing regulation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outcome: Initial result showed 94 per cent of respondents - 8,000 out of 8,500 - rejected the proposal as listed companies, brokers and lawyers generally feared the change would lead the SFC to overregulate and hence hurt the listing market. The SFC and HKEX said they would review the comments before making any consultation</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has edged closer to allowing companies with a dual-class share structure to list on the stock exchange after the regulator backed plans for a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> (SFC) said on Thursday it supported the local bourse's proposed consultation exercise this quarter to gauge opinion on creating a third board aimed at technology start-ups and ‘new economy' firms.There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needsChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board would for the first time permit dual-share listings, which afford one class of shareholder more rights than others. Their long-standing ban in Hong Kong is widely seen as a barrier to potentially lucrative initial public offerings, particularly by technology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's decision to back the move represents a U-turn by the regulator, which two years ago rejected a stock exchange plan to consult the market on introducing the dual-share structure as it considered the proposal at the time did not carry sufficient investor protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia in January suggested launching a new third board with more relaxed listing rules than the main board and the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The third board aims to attract three types of entity - infrastructure companies, start-ups and dual-shareholding firms. Li said on Wednesday the consultation paper would be ready soon for SFC approval before it is launched this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC supports the consultation to allow the public to share their views on the dual-shareholding structure," said Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman of the SFC at a media lunch on Thursday. "The SFC will be open minded to listen to the market comments. However, the regulator will only agree with any listing rule changes if it would develop the market and provide sufficient investor protection measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the SFC took a different attitude to the consultation this time around because the dual shareholding companies would only be listed on the third board. Two years ago, the proposed changes would have applied to companies listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We also need to consider the worldwide trend," he said. Singapore's stock exchange last October said it planned to consult the market on allowing dual shareholding companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many global internet firms such as </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> trade their shares using a dual-class structure, which is permitted in the United States. It is favoured by many start-ups because their founders often hold only small stakes but want to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many observers believe Hong Kong's stock exchange has missed out on billions in annual listing and trading fees due to its refusal to allow such listings on the grounds that they would violate the long-held principle of "one share, one vote".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York rather than Hong Kong in 2014 after the SFC refused its request to allow what it considered a dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba chairman Jack Ma has since said that Hong Kong's listing regime is outdated and does not meet the needs of new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market players have mixed views on the issue, with listed firms and investment bankers preferring a dual-share structure while fund managers generally oppose it as they believe it is not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many new economy companies and start-ups that need to raise funds. Hong Kong needs to change its listing rules to tailor to their needs," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, who support the dual-share proposals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said the third board consultation should be accompanied by a review of the role of the GEM, Hong Kong's second board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The GEM was set up in 1999 with the intention to attract technology firms to list, but it has failed to do so, now acting only as a stepping stone for smaller firms while they wait to grow big enough to move to the main board.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After setting up the third board, we need to find a new role for GEM. Many companies only take GEM as a short cut to list on the main board. We need to make changes to address the problems of this market," Tong said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's securities watchdog has rejected draft proposals by the stock exchange to allow dual-class listings to protect the interest of the investing public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a rare official announcement, the Securities and Futures Commission, headed by chief executive Ashley Alder, said in response to the year-long discussion that its board had "unanimously concluded it did not support the draft proposal for primary listings with weighted voting rights" put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx proposed changing the listing rules that give shareholders in a company voting rights proportionate to their holdings - a move that would likely open it up to more listings but also potentially erode the rights of minority shareholders. This proposal was made after mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> last year opted to move its initial public offering to New York from Hong Kong as local rules do not allow listed companies to adopt unusual shareholding structures. Alibaba raised a record US$25 billion (HK$194 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC vetoed each and every condition put forward by HKEx for eligible applicants. It claimed that "size offers no assurance that a company would treat its shareholders fairly."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the contrary, large companies would likely affect more investors and have a greater impact on markets. For example, when they become index components, "passive" institutional investors will have to buy them even if fund managers disagree with their structures, the SFC said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The criteria expecting eligible applicants to have certain features relating to their businesses and the contribution of their founders "can only be applied subjectively and are therefore inherently vague."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC said the local securities market and reputation would be harmed if weighted voting rights structures became the norm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response, HKEx said it will "further engage with the SFC and the listing committee will decide the best way forward."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It acknowledged that any rule amendments require approval by the SFC's board of directors and their opinion will be material to the final proposal that the exchange puts forward for formal second-stage consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Ceajer Chan Ka-keung said "one share, one vote" is the principle that Hong Kong has adhered to and any change to it should have corresponding evidence and ancilaries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He repeated that the government will not interfere with the SFC which will have the final decision as a regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s4">Opponents to allowing dual-class listing include </span><span class="s1">Cheung Kong (Holdings) (</span><span class="s4">0001), </span><span class="s1">Great Eagle Holdings</span><span class="s4"> (0041), </span><span class="s1">CLP Holdings</span><span class="s4"> (0002), Blackrock, </span><span class="s1">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="s4"> and </span><span class="s1">State Street Corp</span><span class="s4">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC's statement related only to primary listings, potentially paving the way for the exchange to submit a revised draft rule change focusing only on secondary listings.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks inched up yesterday after opening lower and falling to their lowest point since February 14 in the morning session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the close, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was at 31,044.25, up 199.53 points or 0.65 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Afternoon trading once saw the index surge 236 points to 31,081 after dropping to as low as 30,453 in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike past years, the sharp correction in Hong Kong stocks has not drawn swarms of mainland bargain hunters, suggesting to some market watchers that a sharper slide may be coming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US policy tightening would reduce liquidity in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ANZ said factors shaping the Hong Kong dollar this year include the HIBOR-LIBOR spread, which widened after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> ended the zero rate regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is expected that the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will issue more and lower aggregate balance to influence the Hong Kong interbank offered rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, higher fluctuation of the yuan is expected this year and will depend heavily on the US dollar and the international market, said Raymond Yeung, ANZ's chief economist, Greater China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700), which was most actively traded with a turnover of HK$11.93 billion, surged in late trading 3.42 percent to HK$447.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> closed 0.86 percent higher to HK$8.22. </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (2318), which once saw its two-week low in the morning, was up 1.5 percent to HK$84.70.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The best-performed blue chip yesterday was </span><span class="s3">Sino Land</span><span class="s1"> (0083), jumping 4.05 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC Hong Kong Financial Investment (1520), which is related to CEFC, plunged nearly 30 percent after news that CEFC chairman Ye Jianming has been investigated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing yesterday said that investors should understand the risks of investing in companies under the proposed dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said "The weighted voting right under the proposed revisions will be only entitled to individuals but the SFC is communicating with the local bourse to the feasibility of allowing companies to have the weighted voting right."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) chairman Chow Chung-kong stepped down yesterday, saying he has witnessed the HKEX transform itself from a local bourse into an international stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said he was glad to have worked for the Hong Kong stock market operator over the past six years, describing the times as "very busy".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China needs a first-tier global financial hub when developing an open economy, he said, adding that he is confident that the HKEX will catch up with stock exchanges in New York and London.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are still several challenges that lie ahead for the HKEX. For instance, </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> has not yet decided where its will list its initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to be the biggest IPO in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow says he believes the new chairman of HKEX will handle the job well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He once revealed that his biggest regret was the failure to win Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">'s IPO four years ago. But the new listing rules which allow dual-class shares technology companies and unprofitable biotech firms to make debuts in the SAR, could help Hong Kong to provide capital and platform to innovative companies, said Chow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also believes the HKEX will have more opportunities in the future, and forecast great prospects for Hong Kong's financial industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He pointed out to three major achievements during his six-year tenure, including acquiring the </span><span class="s3">London Metal Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">LME</span><span class="s1">), setting up the stock connection, and the listing rule reform.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia described Chow as a "wise man", "brave man", and "supporter", as well as his good teacher and a lifelong friend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX will elect its new chairman at their first meeting today. Laura Cha Shih May-lung, the Financial Services Development Council's chairwoman, is expected to win the position.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission will conduct stress tests more frequently with brokerage firms amid the volatile stock market, chief executive Ashley Alder said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``We will ensure that the market operates in an orderly manner,'' Alder said. ``That means effectively looking at market participants, in particular the brokers, to ensure that they are stable from a financial perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``In that context, we can do normal stress tests. In more volatile conditions we can do the test more frequently,'' he said, adding it is one of the two main goals of the securities watchdog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another goal is that the SFC will ensure that the risk management function of the local exchange is operating properly, by cooperating ``very closely'' with the local bourse, Alder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said so in response to market worries that illegal activities may emerge amid a volatile stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> is busy launching a series of measures to rescue the A-share market, market watchers are concerned the stock connect between Shenzhen and Hong Kong may be delayed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder said he would not comment on the mainland market, but the regulators would announce once they have settled the date to launch the stock linkup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also reiterated that the dual-class listings will not work.

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corporation</span><span class="s1"> (1810) turned from loss into profit, earning 7.61 billion yuan (HK$8.73 billion) for the six months of 2018, partly offset by a one-off share-based compensation recognized in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Revenues surged 75.4 percent to 79.65 billion yuan during the first half, 63.7 percent of which was from mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, the strategic focus was to expand its sahre of the high-end market as the average selling price of smartphones in the mainland rose over 25 percent in the second quarter. Basic earnings per share was 0.759 yuan but no interim dividend was declared.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We placed more priority on fast growth of the company than gross margin growth in order to gain long-term opportunities," chief financial officer Zhou Shouzi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that Xiaomi's international expansion plans included developing other businesses such as TV and internet services in India. Apart from focusing on the western European market where its business grew twenty-seven fold in the first half, the company also expects to enter other East Asian markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) chairwoman Laura Cha Shih May-lung said the stock exchange did not approve Xiaomi's listing application at "lighting speed," contrary to what some people may think, </span><span class="s3">RTHK</span><span class="s1"> reported.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse has already set up a discussion group with mainland exchanges to work on the possibility of including dual-class listed firms into stock connects, she said, adding that Chinese government's plans to launch Chinese Depository Receipts also indicates its recognition of companies with weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In IPO news, Viomi, a supplier of internet-connected home appliances to Xiaomi, said it is planning an initial public offering in the US, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Viomi, based in the southern Chinese city of Foshan, counts Sequoia Capital and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC among its investors, according to its website. Any deal would add to the US$6 billion raised in US first-time share sales by Chinese companies this year, up from US$4 billion during all of last year, data shows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four-year-old company could seek about US$200 million in the share sale, the people said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Viomi aims to list as soon as this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, </span><span class="s3">Zai Lab</span><span class="s1"> is planning a Hong Kong float after its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> debut last year, in what would be the second US-listed Chinese biotech firm to return to the city following an implementation of new listing rules, sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the Shanghai-based company has yet to finalize the size of its Hong Kong offering, one of the sources said it would likely sell 10-20 percent of its enlarged share base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal is expected to be launched early next year, sources added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biopharmaceutical firm raised US$172 million from its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> IPO in September 2017. It had a market capitalization of US$1.18 billion at Tuesday's close in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO comes as China's economy has begun to lose growth momentum this year amid a government push to reduce debt and an escalating trade conflict with the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At nearly $54 billion, China Tower's IPO will become the world's biggest listing since </span><span class="s3">Postal Savings Bank of China</span><span class="s1">'s (1658) $59.5 billion float in Hong Kong in 2016.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks rose slightly yesterday as the Hang Seng Index ended at 29,994.26, up 0.23 percent or 67.76 points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fifty-three percent of stocks showed price increases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Geely Automobile Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0175) jumped 4.31 percent to HK$21.80, the highest since April 20, after its chairman Li Shufu added 20.15 million shares to his holdings last Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the biggest gainer in the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The automaker posted its sales result for April yesterday after trading closed. It sold 128,817 vehicles last month, which represented a 49 percent year-on-year growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Geely has sold 515,113 units in the first four months this year, completing 33 percent of its annual sales target of 1.58 million cars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Education companies also showed positive performance. </span><span class="s3">China Yuhua Education</span><span class="s1"> (6169) climbed 3.13 percent to HK$4.94 while </span><span class="s3">China Education Group Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0839) gained 4.44 percent to HK$11.30, hitting the highest price since their listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Share King" </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700) continued declining and closed at HK$380 when an article criticizing the technology giant went wild on the internet in mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The article, entitled Tencent Has No Dream, claimed that the conglomerate has lost its creativity and is becoming an investment company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Personal computer maker </span><span class="s3">Lenovo Group</span><span class="s1"> (0992) was the biggest loser yesterday after being removed from the blue-chip HSI, while its replacement, </span><span class="s3">CSPC Pharmaceutical Group</span><span class="s1"> (1093), surged 5.91 percent to HK$21.50.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Indexes Company said the Hang Seng Composite Index would be expanded in the third quarter this year to include first listed foreign companies and dual-class listing companies based in Greater China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This will mean mainland investors will be able to trade shares of new-economy companies through stock connects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The index manager will also consider including those with weighted voting rights in the Hang Seng Index and China Enterprises Index, but no timetable is available yet, said its managing director, Kwan Wing-sing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wah Sun Handbags International Holdings opens retail book today as it aims to raise up to HK$138 million from a public offering in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's fifth biggest non-leather handbag original equipment manufacturer in sales revenue terms issued 100 million shares at an indicative price of between HK$1 and HK$1.38 per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After going public in the SAR, Wah Sun plans to use 45 percent of its net IPO proceeds to expand its facilities in Cambodia by 60 percent. It will use 15 percent of the proceeds to set up a product development team in Cambodia, increase gross profit margin and further control costs. The rest of the IPO proceeds are to be used to upgrade systems, refurbish and install showrooms and for general working capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive Ma Hing-ming said he hopes to see Wah Sun increase its market share globally, especially in mainland China and Cambodia after expanding facilities in the latter country. Chairman Ma Hing-man and chief financial officer Li Yat-tin also attended Wah Sun's media briefing yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma said the salary of workers in Cambodia is the lowest in Southeast Asia and just a third of those in China. A Cambodian worker's monthly pay is just about US$170 (HK$1,326) or 1,107 yuan (HK$1,326) compared to about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if salary levels in Cambodia increase in the future, labor cost in that country will still be cheaper than in China, said Ma, adding that hiring people in China is now difficult. But Wah Sun neither plans to close any facility in China nor expand in other Southeast Asian countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700)-backed live game-streaming platform Douyu is reportedly planning to list in Hong Kong this year and raise up to US$400 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douyu said that while it has not yet decided on where to list, it prefers to do it in the SAR since the city is expected to admit for listing new economy companies with dual class shares. Founded in 2013, Douyu saw its revenue spike more than 700 times over the past three years. In March 2016, it received an investment of US$100 million from Tencent and an unspecified amount from </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1">. Douyu also raised 1.5 billion yuan in August 2016 in a financing round led by Phoenix Capital and Tencent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">Zhenro Properties Group</span><span class="s1">'s IPO was barely oversubscribed. It issued 1 billion shares between HK$3.40 to HK$4.08 per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other IPO action, China Great Wall Asset Management Corp seeks to raise US$2 billion in a planned IPO in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US stocks are to see the biggest correction since February and share prices of companies which piled up the most gains this year could fall significantly, </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1"> analysts reportedly said amid a slump in the technology sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"With </span><span class="s3">Amazon</span><span class="s1">'s strong quarter out of the way, and a very strong second quarter GDP number on the tape, investors were finally faced with the proverbial question of 'what do I have to look forward to now,'" a Morgan Stanley analyst wrote in a report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result, portfolios concentrated on technology, consumption and small-caps could be shocked heavily, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Such sectors could see a capital outflow in favor of S&amp;P index stocks, making it unlikely for the index to fall, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, other analysts don't agree with this view. John Hussman, chairman of Hussman Investment Trust who successfully forecast equity market crises in 2000 and 2008, said he expects to see a 64 percent fall in the S&amp;P 500 Index, a 57 percent decline in the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> Index and a steep 69 percent plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Index. While the percentage falls seem too extreme, they are supported by valuation, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citing his calculations, the price to sale ratio of the S&amp;P 500 currently stands at a record high 2.4 times compared to below 0.7 times in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun and vice president Joseph Tsai Chung Hsin have been reducing their stakes in the conglomerate in the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Alibaba filing to the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> last Friday showed that Ma trimmed his stake in Alibaba to 6.4 percent from 7 percent in 2017, while Tsai cut his holding by 0.2 percent to 2.3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last September, the technology giant said Ma and Tsai would offload some holdings for the purpose of charity commitment and general wealth management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Suning.com, the mainland's largest online electronic products retailer, also sold some of its holdings in Alibaba in the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, stocks remained weak yesterday, with the Hang Seng Index dropping 150.12 points or 0.52 percent to 28,583.01. </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700) was the most traded stock, though it closed 2.72 percent lower at HK$357.20, the lowest in nine months. The company was reportedly under investigation by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology due to user reports on information abuses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other technology companies closed lower, with Xiaomi (1810), the first dual class listed firm, tumbling 6.1 percent to HK$17.54, below its IPO price. </span><span class="s3">Sunny Optical Technology</span><span class="s1"> (2382) fell 3.82 percent to HK$130.80, the worst-performing blue chip in the morning session.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Science Park chief Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fun will leave her job when her contract expires at the end of the month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law, who has been in the role for four years, is understood to have written to the Science Park board of directors informing it of her decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, reports suggest that Law's decision to step down was not her own choice and that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor wanted her out.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law's predecessor, Nicholas Brooke, held the position for seven years, while the first chairman, Victor Lo Chung-wing, served for six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law refused to comment on the speculation, saying she would talk to the media only after the government announced its decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many perceived that Law, who was appointed chairwoman by former chief executive Leung Chun-ying in July 2014, has a frosty relationship with Secretary for Innovation and Technology Nicholas Yang Wei-hsiung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, she sidestepped questions about her rapport with Yang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the letter, she said the park still had to seize opportunities to accelerate development. She added that several factors will benefit the park, including the permission of dual-class shares and new channels to allow talented people to work in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local media had reported that the sour relationship between Law and Yang had hindered the promotion of innovation industries in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The news comes as President Xi Jinping pledged to make Hong Kong a global innovation center.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law was also involved in a controversy in August last year when she visited medical university Karolinska Institute's Hong Kong research center at the Science Park and its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While there, she asked the management to explain their research process and was subsequently accused of intervening in academic freedom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam was forced to intervene as she wrote to the institute to guarantee the government's respect for academic freedom.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Office of the Chief Executive did not comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Legislator Charles Mok of the technology sector said the prospects of the industry would not change solely based on one change in personnel.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he paid tribute to Law, saying she was a hardworking person that was always willing to communicate.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index closed above 28,000 points for the first time since May 2015 yesterday, helped by easing geopolitical tensions as well as signs mainland money is continuing to flow steadily into the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HSI rose 1.2 percent to 28,094, while the China Enterprises Index gained 0.7 percent to 11,374.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market has jumped roughly 28 percent so far this year, buoyed by China's economic recovery and cross- border investment. But even after the Hang Seng's surge, Hong Kong-listed shares still trade at a discount of roughly 30 percent to their mainland peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market turnover reached HK$105.9 billion. Stocks rose across the board, led by raw materials, energy and IT shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Tencent (0700) rose 2.1 percent to close at HK$326.60. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> (0005) rose 1.9 percent to HK$76.25.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The past week has witnessed a sharp rise in net inflows from the mainland, and "we believe insurance companies will continue to be a major player and contribute to southbound transactions," wrote Gao Ting, head of China Strategy at </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Those with high dividend yields or large A/H premiums and those that are scarce in the HK market are likely to be favored," Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks were steady yesterday despite a pull-back in the banking sector, as investors bet sectors such as airlines and real estate would benefit from a resurgent yuan against the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's blue-chip CSI300 index was unchanged at 3,834 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index was flat at 3,363.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese brokerage </span><span class="s3">Guosen Securities</span><span class="s1"> is bullish on China stocks, after the Shanghai market held firmly above the 3,300-point mark this week, a level previously seen as a strong resistance. "Economic recovery is expected to kick China's A shares into a bull market," Guosen analyst Yan Xiang said in its latest strategy report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Currently, we could be at the turning point of the economic cycle," Yan said, citing strong economic data, robust commodity prices and modest inflation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said there were some good discussions about the dual class share structure and its role in the future development of the market after attending the first Financial Leaders Forum meeting yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s4">He said </span><span class="s1">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s4"> (0388) and the </span><span class="s1">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s4"> will follow up on the discussions.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief executive contender Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor yesterday criticized rival John Tsang Chun-wah for not funding the Financial Services Development Council adequately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council lacked resources, she said at a seminar organized by the Chi Tung Association, hinting that the 40 Election Committee members from the banking and insurance sub-sectors there should question ex-financial secretary Tsang about it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council was established in 2013 as an advisory body to support financial services. It has been chaired by Executive Councillor Laura Cha Shih May- lung, who is on Lam's campaign team.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another of the four candidates - Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee - said the government has not done enough to develop the financial services industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha had no subordinates, Ip said, and "every staffer at the FSDC has been borrowed from Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau or the Trade Development Council.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang disputed Lam's claims, saying "we provided resources to the FSDC - mainly human resources - to allow it to work on specific financial services industry demands.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ricky Tam Siu-hing, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Investors, said he was not satisfied with the work of FSDC and would rather public money be saved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It leans too much to institutional investors," he added, citing its backing of Alibaba to seek a dual-class listing in Hong Kong and disregarding the interests of retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial service sector legislator Christopher Cheung Wah-fung said: "I've asked Mrs Cha repeatedly to look more into the interests of smaller-sized brokers. She might have thought of us as unimportant."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chi Tung Association chairman Ng Lin-fung said each of the three chief executive contenders at the seminar has merits and the association's 30-plus Election Committee members would not bundle votes for one of them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fourth contender Woo Kwok-hing was invited but could not attend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">Chinese General Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> will give its 18 nominations to Lam, said chairman Jonathan Choi Koon-shum.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retail tranche of Xiaomi's IPO, the first public offering in Hong Kong that offers dual-class shares, was oversubscribed by only eight times, market sources said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese smartphone maker, which closed book building yesterday, lured around 110,000 investors. Its public offering froze only about HK$23 billion worth of investments - way below market expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The final IPO price, which is expected to be known today, may be set by Xiaomi at the lower level or below the mid-point of the HK$17 to HK$22 indicative price range. Its shares will start trading on July 9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Prosperous Industrial (Holdings) will start book building today. It priced its IPO at between 89 HK cents and HK$1.25 per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One board lot of 4,000 shares will require a minimum investment of HK$5,050. The company will set the final IPO price on July 9 and its shares will start trading on July 13. WAG Worldsec Corporate Finance is sole IPO sponsor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The recreational bags and packs manufacturer will issue a total of 280 million shares, and use 67 percent of the net IPO proceeds to expand its manufacturing facilities in Cambodia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, airline ticket distributor Cteh (1620) had a weak debut yesterday as it closed 1.4 percent lower.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Wise Talent Information Technology</span><span class="s1"> (6100), a mainland firm which operates an online job matching platform, will debut today. Its share price closed 8.48 percent lower in the grey market yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other IPO action, mainland developer Redsun Properties Group will open retail book today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors need to fork out at least HK$3,212 for one board lot of 1,000 shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new bourse boss says she will draw up a strategic plan to take the stock exchange operator into the next decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who was elected the new chairwoman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> yesterday, said her priority is to prepare its next three-year plan - 2019 to 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, also the chairwoman of the Financial Services Development Council, a government advisory body, said there is no conflict of interest in her roles, but added she is ready to step down as the head of the FSDC if the government finds a suitable replacement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said she was honored to be the first woman to hold the top post at the HKEX, pointing out that at present around 14 percent of directors in public companies are women.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked whether the operator would strive to invite Alibaba to list in Hong Kong since the new listing rule - which welcomes dual-class shares companies to make their debuts - takes effect on Monday, Cha said she would not comment on individual companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But, she added, the HKEX will work to attract both traditional and new-economy firms to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On concerns about whether it is bad timing to introduce reforms due to global market jitters and fears of a trade war between China and the United States, Cha said there is never a perfect time as nobody can predict the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha's election comes two days after the bourse operator finalized reforms of its listing regulations to allow companies with weighted voting rights structures to float in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The FSDC backed the reforms in its March response to an HKEX consultation, describing them as an "important step in the right direction." The reforms are intended to lure new-economy companies to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2001, Cha was appointed vice chairman of the mainland regulator </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> - the first non-mainland Chinese person to hold such a role. In 1997, she became the first female deputy chair of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's securities regulator</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha is a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings and also a non-executive deputy chairman of HSBC's Hong Kong operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The three previous chairmen of HKEX, Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, Ronald Arculli and Chow Chung-kong, each served the maximum six-year term.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global stocks extended losses amid the escalating trade war after tariffs and retaliatory tariffs were unleashed by the world's two biggest economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng index yesterday lost 841 points as investors feared that the trade row would not be resolved any time soon, and the market is facing a sell-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors should be closely watching Xiaomi - which is seeking an initial public offering in Hong Kong - as the Chinese smartphone maker's recent moves are indicative of the jitters in local equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi yesterday said it has decided to delay its mainland offering of Chinese Depository Receipts until after its Hong Kong initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is probably because Xiaomi did not see a positive response in the market and so had no choice but to put the brakes on its CDR issue, though it had earlier enlarged the size of its CDR offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China A-shares have softened recently as the mainland market is short on capital. Several unicorns are to be blamed for this, as they were allowed to list without waiting in line.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These unicorns raised large chunks of funds even though they had not shown significant prospects for earnings growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some market insiders are critical of Chinese authorities who broke the rules to support listing unicorns and CDRs in such a weak market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's sudden delay of its CDR issue also shows that mainland regulators need to adjust their policies on CDRs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's IPO opens on Monday and as it will be the first listing under Hong Kong's new dual-class share structure, investors are advised to do short-term trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its cornerstone investors have been finalized and according to media reports, none of them are from outside China. This is understandable as foreign investors will be cautious in the face of the reignited trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The days ahead will be crucial for Xiaomi. It remains unclear how much the trade war will hurt market sentiment but the worst case scenario would be a delay in the retail tranche.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although some investors may not bite, lessons need to be learned from Xiaomi - whether it fails or succeeds - as it is an important indicator of the current state of the market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's </span><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping, an online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform, is bringing its sizable initial public offering to Hong Kong, where it aims to raise over US$4 billion (HK$31.2 billion), people with knowledge of the deal said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm filed plans late on Friday for the city's second multi-billion-dollar tech float this year after smartphone maker </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">'s blockbuster IPO of up to US$6.1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping is, after Xiaomi, the latest company with a dual-class share structure to file for a Hong Kong listing, under the city's new rules designed to attract new economy and biotech companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based firm, backed by gaming and social media company </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (0700), was valued at around US$30 billion in a fundraising round last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is aiming for a US$60-billion valuation with the IPO, though industry insiders said it may have difficulty reaching that target as it is still money-losing and relies on a cash-burning business model to boost growth. The firm is likely to list in October, said the people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Meituan</span><span class="s1">-Dianping's other backers include venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and DST Global, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and state-owned investment company </span><span class="s3">Temasek Holdings</span><span class="s1">, as well as the </span><span class="s3">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, chief executive Wang Xing owns 11.4 percent of the company, while Tencent owns 20.1 percent and </span><span class="s3">Sequoia Capital</span><span class="s1"> 11.4 percent. Wang will remain controlling shareholder after the listing, the prospectus showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its draft prospectus, which gave investors the first detailed look at its financial health ahead of the IPO, the company disclosed a 19 billion yuan (HK$22.79 billion) loss for 2017, steeper than in the previous two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its adjusted net loss - which excludes the impact of fair value changes of convertible redeemable preferred shares and other items - was 2.85 billion yuan, smaller than losses of 5.35 billion yuan in 2016 and 5.91 billion yuan in 2015, the prospectus showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Bank of Jiujiang starts its book building today, issuing 360 million H shares. Entry fee is HK$2,214 one broad lot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The management expects the IPO to support the bank's capital adequacy by pushing it up several percentage points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There will be 98 new companies listed in Hong Kong's stock exchange in the first half this year, up 44 percent year on year, according to an estimate by </span><span class="s3">Ernst &amp; Young</span><span class="s1">. For the second half of 2018, E&amp;Y believed that IPOs in the city will be dominated by retail, technology and financial sectors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bright Smart was among firms working through the weekend in the trial, which saw brokers place mock trades to test their computer systems for clearing and settlement processes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A September 13 trial run will simulate a failure of the stock connect system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This comes after the stock exchange ran smaller-scale tests the previous weekend with 96 brokers that handle 80 percent of the SAR's trading volume.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other action, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) published a ``concept paper'' on Friday to seek market opinion on whether a structure of weighted voting rights should be allowed for firms listed or seeking to list on the local bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The market needs to be regulated, but it also needs to be developed,'' chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia wrote in his blog, noting ``a responsibility to take a closer look ... to determine if any changes or flexibility are required.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has followed the ``one share, one vote'' principle for 25 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It sparked heated discussions after Alibaba sought to list last year with its 27-member partnership committee having decisive voting power in the firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant finally chose to list in the United States, where companies with dual-class share structures make up 14 percent of total market capitalization of listed firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker is expected to make a debut at the end of next month or the beginning of July in the first IPO under the new listing rule that allows new-economy companies with dual-class shares - including unprofitable biotech firms - to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's latest value is reportedly between US$65 billion (HK$507 billion) and US$70 billion, lower than the market expectation of US$100 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Xiaomi is expected to raise at least US$10 billion from the public offering, which may be the biggest IPO in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">CK Hutchison Holdings</span><span class="s1"> are due to announce an alliance tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, China's largest music-streaming company, has invited investment banks to pitch next week for a role in a United States IPO worth up to US$4 billion, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> publication IFR reported, citing people familiar with the plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The music arm of tech giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> plans to go public by the end of the year, in a deal in which it could raise between US$3 billion and US$4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent Music is seeking an IPO valuation of about US$25 billion, according to IFR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was valued at US$12.3 billion late last year when Europe's </span><span class="s3">Spotify Technology</span><span class="s1"> swapped a stake with it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the agreement, Spotify owns about 9 percent of Tencent Music while </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> owns a 7.5 percent stake in Spotify.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, Spotify had a market capitalization of US$28.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent Music first started discussion with banks about its planned IPO late last year. Progress was slow as the company focused on the Spotify transaction and was exploring the possibility of a Hong Kong listing as the city's exchange operator unveiled plans to encourage more tech companies to list in the city by loosening rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent Music, however, has decided to go for a US listing as Spotify is listed there and HKEx's new rules do not allow corporate entities to benefit from weighted voting rights for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx will launch a separate consultation by July 31 to explore such an option.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A working group has been formed to examine a two-tier profits tax system, says Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau Yee-cheung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A report will go from Lau's bureau to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po once the research is completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau expects the effort to lead to a reform proposal going to the Legislative Council for discussion in the second half of next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lam suggested during her election campaign that a two-tier tax regime could relieve burdens on small and medium- sized enterprises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal now being discussed is for the tax rate for the first HK$2 million of profits to be lowered from the current 16.5 percent to 10 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau estimated that there would be about HK$5 billion less annual tax revenue if such a reform was implemented.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the HK$5 billion, he argued, would be an investment in society as there would be a positive impact on overall economic development. There would also be a boost for the financial and technology sectors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Taxation Institute of Hong Kong</span><span class="s1"> council member Marcellus Wong Yui- keung said the loss of HK$5 billion would be a relatively small proportion of the overall annual tax revenue of HK$140 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the SAR could afford it and that it could alleviate greatly burdens on SMEs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau also said a </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> consultation on the proposal for a new board with more flexible listing requirements to attract "new economy" companies ends tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will be followed by HKEx reviewing opinions and then issuing a report. He said that on one hand there are many opinions in the market in support of a dual-class share structure, while on the other hand there are many concerns about corporate governance and protection for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So the need is to maintain a balance between development and protection.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yesterday also saw Lau introducing Undersecretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan Ho-lim and political assistant Pauline Yeung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lau said Chan has broad experience in the finance sector and has also been a district council member.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He will help liaise with political parties and be responsible for work related to financial technology, green finance and the Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yeung is well versed in research work and is a talented linguist, Chan said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will work closely with mainland regulators and strive to include new-economy companies to stock connects, hoping to confirm the timetable as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse operator made the announcement after mainland stock exchanges said they would not expand their stock connect scheme with Hong Kong to foreign firms, companies with different voting right structures and so-called stapled securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stapled securities are formed when two or more securities are contractually bound together to form a single unit that cannot be bought or sold separately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Exchanges on both sides have agreed that foreign company shares and stapled securities will not be included in the list of eligible securities under stock connect's southbound trading for the time being," the HKEX said, implying its counterparts have not reached an agreement in accordance to dual-class listed firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai stock exchange said it reached the decision after consulting with domestic brokerages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Most of the investors expressed a lack of understanding of these new types of securities," the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Domestic investors do not fully understand the concept of stapled securities and had not completely grasped the operations and financial systems of foreign companies, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These types of securities need to wait until they have reached a certain quantity and a market operation basis before they can be considered for the participation of mainland investors," the exchange added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Responding to that, the HKEX believed companies listed in the city with weighted voting rights are eligible to be included in connects due to strict listing requirements it has set for such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse said investors are thus well protected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only companies with a market capitalization of HK$40 billion can get listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China exchanges' decision not to include the three types of firms means that mainland investors will not be able to invest in </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">, which made its debut in Hong Kong last week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese phone maker Xiaomi is highly likely to list in Hong Kong, and it will be at a possible valuation of as much as US$100 billion (HK$780 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm, which is the fourth biggest smartphone maker in China, has hired </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> to work on its initial public offering.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say Hong Kong's new reform of the listing rules, which will permit new economy companies with dual-class shares to go public in the city, may help the SAR beat New York in attracting Xiaomi to choose Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) is considering rule changes aimed at increasing trading, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Rebates to market makers, simplified rules for using collateral across multiple positions and the removal or reduction of stamp duty charges are among measures being considered, Li said. Some changes would require approval from the securities regulator or government, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The operator is eyeing changes as it battles for business with foreign rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx plans to allow so-called innovative companies with dual-class share structures as among measures that could see the biggest changes to listing rules since 1993. It has also set up three trading links with the mainland, with more on the way. And in November it introduced iron ore futures - a challenge to Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The objective, if there is an objective, is to really make our market more competitive," Li said. "Our strategy is making our initial public offering market more relevant, make our market more connected, and make our derivatives market more competitive. That really is our three-leg strategy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx's share price has now hit its highest level since July 2015, gaining 37 percent in 12 months to Friday to outperform a majority of peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite being the world's fourth-biggest stock market, Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore for derivatives trading. Singapore's FTSE China A50 index futures, for example, is often Asia's most-traded offshore contract.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One idea under discussion is to pay rebates to market makers during product launches, Li said. A common feature in other developed markets, including the United States, sees such payments restricted by regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are talking about small-scale, incremental, early-stage pilot programs, where people can at least begin to think 'we could have cash incentives, we could have rebates,'" Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another area of debate is cross-margin requirements, Li said without elaborating.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Singapore, traders can post less collateral on offsetting positions, and that can reduce execution costs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx spokeswoman Wong Sau-ching said more details will become public in due course.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's equity investors are rekindling their love for newcomers as four of the city's recent listings surged yesterday after failing to hold on to their debut pops last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Ka-shing backed </span><span class="s3">Razer Inc</span><span class="s1">.(1337) soared by as much as 24 percent and closed at HK$3.70 though it is still lower than its debut price, while online car-financing provider </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1"> (2858) jumped 5.7 percent. Tencent (0700) funded E-book publisher China Literature (0772) rose 4.4 percent to HK$79.40 and </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (6060) edged 3.29 percent higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">MI Ming Mart Holdings (8473), which listed this month, soared 48.05 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Those stocks have already corrected quite a lot so that's driving investors to buy them back," said Castor Pang, head of research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi HK.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Whether they will remain strong over the next few days is questionable. Those stocks are very volatile."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Razer and Yixin still trade below their debut price following last year's losses. That's even as 2017 turned out to be a good year for investors who participated in initial public offerings - an index of non-US newly public companies jumped 33 percent in 2017, the best year since Bloomberg began tracking the data seven years ago. Nowhere was the IPO frenzy greater than in Hong Kong - where demand, especially for tech shares, was the most intense since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped 1.81 percent or 558.26 points to 31,431.89 yesterday, extending a rebound since a slump in global shares early this month ahead of the reopening of China's market trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) will reportedly start tomorrow a public consultation on the listing of companies with dual class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, most Asian currencies edged lower yesterday as the US dollar was bolstered by rising </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> yields and optimism ahead of </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">' last policy meeting minutes which would released today. Andy Ji, a strategist for </span><span class="s3">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</span><span class="s1"> in Singapore, said rising </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> yields will put pressure on Asian currencies in the coming months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market is looking at the threshold of 3 percent in 10-year </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> yield. If it reaches that level, there is going to be a large risk reduction in the markets," Ji said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added it will support the US dollar against Asian currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US 10-year Treasury yields were at 2.8877 percent in Asian hours, hovering near a four-year peak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rise in yields came as investors made room for this week's deluge of US$258 billion (HK$2.01 trillion) of government debt supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, the South Korean won fell for the fourth consecutive session, while the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht also declined. The Taiwan dollar and the Philippine peso edged higher.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As most of the other biotech firms, CanSino has not recorded any profit yet.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ascletis Pharma, another biotech stock benefiting from the city's newly introduced dual-class listing, opens its retail book yesterday. It has asked for a minimum investment of HK$16,161, the highest in Hong Kong's history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has another product ready to be commercialized, its chairman Wu Jinzi unveiled yesterday. But he did not comment on whether the entry fee was too high for investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Fosun Pharmaceutical (2196) is to raise HK$2.60 billion from a share placement, with 9 percent share price discount.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The group expects to use the fund on debt repayment, operation capital supplement as well as potential merger and acquisition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Real estate services firm E-House Enterprises Holdings (2048), backed-by </span><span class="s3">Henderson Land Development</span><span class="s1"> (0012), was the only company that makes a debut today.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was priced at HK$14.38, the lower end of its initial offering range as it was undersubscribed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Following that, E-House dropped 3.62 percent in Bright Smart (1428) grey market and closed at HK$13.86.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Koolearn Technology Holding, a unit of Nasdaq-listed New Oriental Education and Technology Group, is also reportedly to raise as much as HK$2.35 billion in the city. Tencent (0700) is its second-largest shareholder, holding 12 percent of stake.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qilu Expressway (1576) ended at HK$2.3, 8.0 percent lower than its IPO price of HK$2.5. Its IPO subscriber would have lost HK$200 on book. At the same time, </span><span class="s3">Hyfusin Group</span><span class="s1"> (8512) grew from HK$0.465 to HK$0.55.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, the weighted voting rights suggest that shares can be classified one class-carrying, one vote per share and another class- carrying, multiple votes per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The idea was sought by Alibaba as a precondition for listing in Hong Kong in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It later listed on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> under such a shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse has stressed it holds no view for or against the weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia yesterday said the consultation result of volatile control mechanism and closing auction session will be released early next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He confirmed that the HKEx board of directors has approved the two mechanisms, which are likely to be launched in the second half next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange operator says it will delay changes that allow companies to hold shares with more voting rights as more time is needed for investors to become accustomed to recent rule changes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it will not launch a consultation proposing to allow companies to hold weighted voting rights as had been planned as part of measures to lure large tech companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April, HKEX changed its rules to allow companies with weighted voting rights - also know as dual-class shares - to list in the city as part of a broader shake-up of the listing regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far, smartphone maker Xiaomi is the only company to have listed in Hong Kong with a WVR structure. Yesterday's announcement sent Xiaomi's shares to a two-week low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesperson of HKEX said: "We have huge reservations about allowing corporate WVR beneficiaries as this is seen as a major attempt to further dilute the principle of one share, one vote."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the initial change and its extension have been controversial topics in Hong Kong with some critics arguing that by undermining the principle of "one share, one vote" they privilege certain shareholders over others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said they will bar investor access to Hong Kong-listed companies with WVR structures, citing the complexity of the holdings. The three bourses later agreed to set up a working group to address the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ownership of WVR shares has so far been limited to company founders. Under current rules, WVR shares lose their additional rights if the founder ceases to be a director of the company, or transfers the shares to another person. The HKEX had said it planned to launch a separate consultation by July 31 to consider extending weighted rights to companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But yesterday it said it needed to discuss the matter further with stakeholders to develop a broader consensus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asia Corporate Governance Association, said the safeguards the exchange had brought in to protect investors after the rule change were weak and hard to enforce.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Extending WVRs to corporates would mean WVR in perpetuity," he said at a press conference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet giant Tencent is seeking to list its online music unit in the United States in part because weighted voting rights extend to companies there.</span></p>
