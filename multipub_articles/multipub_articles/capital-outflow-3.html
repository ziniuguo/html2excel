<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves rose slightly in June, beating market expectations, but the gains come amid renewed fears over capital outflows after Britain's vote to leave the </span><span class="s3">European Union</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign exchange reserves stood at US$3.21 trillion at the end of June, up US$13.4 billion on the previous month, according to data released by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts polled by the Reuters news agency had expected reserves to fall by about US$20 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reserves dropped US$27.9 billion in May and fell US$125.2 billion in the first half the year from the end of 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Concerns about the global economic fallout from Brexit have led to a weak sterling and strong US dollar, which has added to pressure on the value of the yuan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As US President-elect Donald Trump enters the Oval Office this week, tensions between China and the US have flared once again, adding further pressure to the offshore yuan and bringing a chill to Sino-US relations, analysts are warning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump's seemingly provocative remarks about the "one China" policy, regarding the status of Taiwan, has angered Beijing and sparked outrage among many.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With China warning it would "take the gloves of" if Trump continues to "impair" the "one China" principle, which China says is the political foundation of bilateral ties, tensions are certainly escalating between the two countries.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And over the past few weeks, the US-China head-to-head over sovereignty of the South China Sea and Trump's appointment of hardliners to lead US trade policy have also unsettled markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas investment by mainland insurers has picked up momentum this year, as they accelerate their buying of assets, according to fresh data released on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International investment accounted for about 2 per cent of mainland insurers' total assets, still far from the regulatory cap of 15 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the figures from ciicapital.com, a website that tracks the insurance industry, domestic insurers invested 166.7 billion yuan in the first three quarters of the year - that's already more than double the 71 billion yuan invested in the whole of last year. Real estate investment accounted for 91 per cent of the deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The stronger momentum was boosted by a growing expectation of a weaker yuan, the economic slowdown, worsening assets quality at home and expectations of stable returns on commercial real estate such as office and hotels overseas,” said Kevin Fang, general manager of ciicapital.com, in Shanghai on Wednesday.Overseas investment is impeded by foreign exchange controls and bets on domestic stocks speculation can be very risky and face tighter supervision from regulatorsTian Dan, Soochow Securities researcher</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he also noted that tighter foreign exchange controls could slow the pace of deals involving large sums of cross-border capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against that background, analysts now expect insurers could turn to the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock link, and its upcoming cousin, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong link as limited authorised channels.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Insurance Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> said in September it was allowing insurers to participate in the Shanghai stock link.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tian Dan, a Soochow Securities researcher, said domestic insurers will eventually have to accept the reality of lower investment returns amid China's persistent low-interest rates at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Overseas investment is impeded by foreign exchange controls and bets on domestic stocks speculation can be very risky and face tighter supervision from regulators,” said Tian.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While there are not too many options on the assets side, insurers are under pressure to take it really seriously to control their liability to maintain profit margins.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing on Friday reaffirmed the role of the Shanghai free-trade zone (FTZ) as a pioneering area for bold liberalisations including the full convertibility of the yuan, a fresh sign that freer cross-border capital flows are imminent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said that reforms, including the launch of a pilot scheme allowing individual investors to directly trade overseas stocks, were being studied to reinforce Shanghai's transformation into a global financial centre.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank said the FTZ in Shanghai would spearhead the move to make yuan convertible under the capital account - a move to facilitate cross-border investments in equities, properties and production facilities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It did not give a clear timeframe, saying the liberalisation would happen with a "step-by-step" approach.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank said the launch of the qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII2) scheme was being reviewed and would take place at an "appropriate time", a sign the long-heralded reform is in the pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The statement, jointly published by other ministry-level authorities such as the Ministry of Commerce, also mentioned that qualified investors would be allowed to trade equities and futures across the border while facilitating two-way commodity trading and direct investments to support the real economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is a clear message that the authorities are determined to deepen the financial reforms despite worries about China's hesitation to fully open its financial sector," said a Shanghai official. "The Shanghai FTZ will be further used as an important experimental ground for planned reforms."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai FTZ, the first of its kind on the mainland and planned as a Hong Kong-style free port, was launched in late 2013. But slow progress in conducting reforms inside the zone kept foreign investors away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A one-off devaluation in yuan and a recent stock market rout in China deepened worries that the reforms, including the QDII2, would be put on hold.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The QDII2, on top of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programme, could technically direct a larger capital outflow owing to a crisis of confidence in the A-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing approved three more FTZs, in Tianjin, Guangdong and Fujian, early this year while allowing Shanghai to expand its FTZ by four times, which now covers more than 120 sq km.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shanghai remains a promising international metropolis with expectations for a further financial liberalisation," said Albert Lau, managing director for China at property consultancy </span><span class="s3">Savills</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If Shanghai were to implement free capital flows across the border, foreign institutions and capital will gravitate to the city to make it one of the world's most important financial centres."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Guan Tao, a former head with the balance of payments department at the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1">, said more detailed plans were needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A primary concern among the key financial policymakers is rampant hot money flows amid eased regulatory oversight.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's exchange regulator said there has been no evidence of stepped-up capital outflows during the recent bout of volatility in currency markets, indicating that underlying conditions are very different from other periods of turmoil in markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Since June 25 this year, market volatility has surged, but from the daily data such as foreign exchange settlement and sales and non-banking cross-border capital flows, it is far from the high pressure of capital outflow that took place in 2015 and 2016,” a spokeswoman for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), China's exchange regulator, said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, volatility in the foreign exchange markets continued throughout the session on Thursday, with China's yuan hitting a one-year low against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan traded by international investors outside the mainland fell 0.9 per cent to 6.8029, after easing 0.5 per cent on Wednesday. The currency has fallen more than 6.4 per cent since June 14 when </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> opted not to follow the US in raising interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore spot yuan dropped as much as 0.8 per cent per cent on Thursday, trading at 6.7651 against the dollar, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">. The yuan has lost more 4 per cent against the greenback in the past month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trade row between the world's two largest economies has intensified concerns of a potential spillover into the currency front.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan midpoint Thursday at 6.7066, or 0.23 per cent weaker than the previous fix of 6.6914. This level marked the first time the fixing was set below the psychologically important 6.7 per dollar level since August 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In contrast to earlier this year, today's weakness seems to reflect a more explicit policy decision. After signalling it would accept more volatility in the currency, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has followed up by lowering the daily fixing rate,” said Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. “Looking ahead, more yuan weakness seems warranted, but Chinese authorities will likely prevent the currency from moving too sharply in any direction.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> has said it would keep the yuan stable, but analysts widely expect China to keep the yuan on a weaker footing and monetary policy lose to support the economy and boost domestic demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A devaluation of the yuan could neutralise the impact of the US trade tariffs on Chinese goods, which applies to US$450 billion worth of imports, just short of the US$505 billion that China sends to the US. However, a sharp fall of the yuan of more than 10 per cent in a month or two could trigger massive capital outflows from China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We think that China might bring devaluation [of the yuan] into the negotiations [with the US],” said Zhu Haibin, chief china economist at JP Morgan. “But it's better not to use it because the risk [of capital flight] is very high.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When China devalued the yuan in 2015, it suffered almost US$500 billion worth of capital flight in the same year, according to the Institute of International Finance. Global financial markets also took a hit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spokeswoman for SAFE said that the exchange regulator had to assess the impact of trade friction on capital flows and will use “counter-cyclical” measures to respond to short-term volatility, adding that China can cope with any challenge given its “ample” reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A devaluation of the yuan can also trigger a currency war, in which other central banks would deliberately lower the value of their respective currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Rees, emerging market strategist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin, said China is wary of a being labelled a currency manipulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We do not expect China to turn a trade war into a currency war. Since Beijing will ease monetary policy to support domestic demand, we have revised our forecasts. Given the experience of 2015, when fears of a Chinese yuan devaluation damaged global investor sentiment, we think that policymakers will not let the currency weaken to 7.00 to the US dollar. But we would not be surprised to see it trading closer to 6.80 to the US dollar by year-end,” Rees said in a note.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some years after buying a flat in Guangzhou, mainlander Moon Wong made his first overseas investment this year, paying A$700,000 (HK$4.4 million) for a 900 square foot apartment in Sydney.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There's a growing trend among mainland individuals buying overseas properties. I am only following the trend," said Wong, who works for a property agency in Guangzhou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investment in overseas real estate has soared in recent years. Since 2009, the value has risen to US$15 billion from US$600 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Property consultancy Savills estimates mainland institutions invested close to US$13.5 billion last year, more than double the amount in 2012, on overseas property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the outbound investment is unlikely to grow any faster in coming years, Savills believes it is safe to assume it will continue to grow at an average annual pace of 20 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This would bring the figure close to US$50 billion per year by 2020, comparable to, if not a little more than, what the US has invested in overseas markets over the last couple of years," Savills said in a research report released last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"New waves of investment from China are likely to occur within the next decade as we see market-orientated reforms opening up for Chinese companies to explore opportunities overseas."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under new measures for foreign investment, published in September by the Ministry of Commerce, mainland companies are allowed to invest overseas without prior approval although they must first register their investment with the authorities. Only investments in sensitive industries or countries - not detailed by the ministry - require approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, any overseas investment project of more than US$100 million required regulatory approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A softening of the local market - low yields and depressed prices - would also continue to affect mainland investors and developers, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to consultancy Knight Frank, the new wave of investors also includes small to mid-capitalised state-owned firms and smaller developers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first wave of mainland capital outflow saw the sovereign wealth fund investing in trophy assets and banks acquiring property for owner occupation. Large developers followed, looking to diversify with an overseas presence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In what Knight Frank calls a third wave, equity investors and insurance firms are seeking core and yield-driven opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It says a fourth wave is taking shape, with investors consisting of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, small to mid-cap state-owned enterprises and private developers increasingly exploring overseas growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tan Wei Min, a New York-based property agent, said more individual mainlanders now wanted to invest in the US, especially in Manhattan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I see a rise in buyers from mainland China. High-net-worth individuals are the largest group of foreign buyers in Manhattan. The trend has been growing over the years," Tan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So far, the thrust of overseas property investment has been in the gateway cities of Australia, the US and Britain. This year, Australia has seen the strongest growth in inbound real estate investment from China, which grew more than 60 per cent from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For Wong, Sydney's living environment was a big draw. But more than that he liked the cheaper interest rate and lower initial payments on home purchases. "The mortgage rate is about 5 per cent in Australia, lower than in China. As I have already bought my first home here and have to pay more for my second unit, I decided to buy overseas," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong loan demand lifted profits at Southeast Asia's largest bank but growth will slow in the coming six months, said the chairman of DBS Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">DBS posted record first-half profits yesterday, a day after the Singaporean bank abandoned its bid for Indonesian bank Danamon. Profit in the first six months of the year grew 5 per cent to SG$1.84 billion (HK$11.21 billion) due to higher loan volumes and higher interest margins. Profits at the bank's Hong Kong operation also climbed 31 per cent to HK$2.96 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chairman of DBS Hong Kong, Sebastian Paredes, said loans surged 15 per cent over the past 12 months, but a dim economic outlook for the second half would drag down the overall growth rate for the year to 10 to 12 per cent. He added that the net interest margin in the second half would remain steady at 1.5 to 1.6 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We have been able to capitalise on our connectivity with China," Paredes said. He said two-thirds of the loans were short-term one-year trade loans to mainland firms, mainly state-owned enterprises, and much of the rest to small and medium-sized enterprises in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Paredes said slowing economic growth on the mainland, capital outflow from Hong Kong and the predicted depreciation of the yuan would make the second half "more challenging", but mainland demand for trade loans remained strong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yuan deposits rose from 13 billion yuan to 16 billion yuan in the past year. Paredes said DBS Hong Kong's yuan business grew 15 to 22 per cent in the last two years, thanks to the liberalisation of the yuan, accounting for over 20 per cent of earnings in the first half. He expects the yuan business to contribute up to 25 per cent of earnings in the second.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As bond products go, this is about as obscure as it gets. According to some mainland news reports, the </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1"> plan separately to issue bonds denominated in so-called Special Drawing Rights to be made available on the mainland. What? That may be the response of most people. Why? That would be the question of most professional investors. SDR are monetary units issued by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> and are held by its member states as part of their currency reserves. Their value is determined by a weighted currency basket composed of the US dollar, the euro, the yen and the British pound. In a major coup for China, the yuan will be included in the basket as early as October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many countries have long been critical of the international reserve currency status enjoyed by the US dollar. China is particularly obsessed with having the SDR playing a greater role as a reserve currency to challenge the greenback. It considers inclusion of the yuan in the SDR a boost to the currency's international status and prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">August lift-off: China set for Special Drawing Rights bond issues, report says[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/1997896/august-lift-china-set-special-drawing-rights-bond-issues]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aside from member states using SDR as part of their reserves parked with the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">, the monetary units have had little use in international trade and investment. However, during the global financial crisis, SDR proved to be useful in helping to boost liquidity for troubled countries. The yuan's inclusion in the SDR is a big step; having bond products denominated in the yuan-included SDR may also broaden their investment appeal. But at least initially, Chinese state banks are expected to be their most likely investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the last analysis, reforms to the yuan are the only way to make it a major international currency. Significant changes have already been made such as removing the minimum price on lending rates and the ceiling on bank deposit rates. But much more needs to be done in liberalising the interest rate regime and opening capital accounts such as lifting restrictions on capital outflow. These are far more important than SDR inclusion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">'s move to limit and tighten scrutiny on yuan outflows via lending to offshore entities may make it more difficult for less established mainland firms to buy offices or expand in Hong Kong and other countries, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts, however, expect the policy to be relaxed after the yuan value, which has depreciated substantially against the US dollar, stabilises.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We believe that this move was issued primarily to stabilise the yuan ... it is probably temporary and may be relaxed once it stabilises,” said Thomas Dillenseger, senior director of </span><span class="s3">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</span><span class="s1">, a business consultancy firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the stringent approval process will also cause significant delays to yuan fund transfers, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">, on Tuesday asked banks to restrict non-financial mainland firms' yuan fund transfers in the form of lendings to offshore entities. Among the new norms are the criteria that lenders must have been registered for at least a year and can only lend to overseas companies in which they have a shareholding, subject to a cap equivalent to 30 per cent of their shareholders' equity. In addition, the loans also need to be supported by valid commercial reasons and must be repaid as per schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bureaucratic hurdles have already caused a temporary suspension in some inter-company yuan fund transfers of at least one firm contacted by the Post, pending more paper work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We can't transfer money, either in yuan or in US dollar, to our subsidiaries overseas at this moment,” said a staffer at a large state-owned firm who is responsible for cross border transactions, who asked not to be named since she is not authorised to speak to the media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since the new rule took effect on Wednesday, she said local banks have been discouraging them to conduct any capital account cross-border transactions, for example, for overseas debt repayment, despite having set up intra-group yuan cash pools on both sides of the border.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They want the money to come back, so you have to prove your cash pool will have net yuan inflows in the end,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-based developer Far East Consortium International chairman David Chiu said the policy could dampen mainland firms' property investments in Hong Kong, while property consultancy JLL's head of capital markets Joseph Tsang expects the move to affect mainland firms without offices in Hong Kong or overseas and want to buy one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang said established mainland firms may not be affected much as they have access to offshore fund-raising channels for the capital needed to finance their overseas expansion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing began tightening cross-border flows of yuan several months ago amid an accelerating net capital outflow that hit 2 trillion yuan (HK$2.3 trillion) in the first 10 months of this year, according to business executives.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It was believed that a large portion of the money going out was used for hedging currency volatility rather than for investments or trade,” said Wang Feng, chairman of Shanghai-based investment bank Ye Lang Capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Banks that granted yuan loans to mainland companies' offshoots outside the mainland have failed to effectively monitor the use of the funds due to the lack of regulatory mechanisms.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chong Lub-bun, a director with C Consultancy that advises on Chinese companies' overseas acquisition deals, told the Post the curbs might not be a long-lasting one given the timing of its issuance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan has been touching its multi-year lows and the liquidity is tightening at this point in time,” he said. “Chances are that when things get better, the regulations can be loosened.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong police have launched "a significant number" investigations into the suspicious use of </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> bank cards to withdraw cash from ATMs in the city amid growing concern over illicit capital flight from the mainland, according to sources with knowledge of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The development comes as SAR monetary chiefs continue to neither deny nor confirm that the city's network of ATMs is experiencing a "staggering" surge in withdrawals[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2107543/hong-kong-atm-network-sees-surge-china-unionpay-withdrawals] by people using </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> bank cards in the weeks following the introduction of facial recognition technology[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2093408/macau-launch-facial-recognition-and-identity-card-checks-atms] in cash dispensing machines in the neighbouring casino hub of Macau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources have told the South China Morning Post that a number of cases of suspicious ATM withdrawals are under investigation by the police, including one on Hong Kong Island last month in which a mainland person was arrested after being caught trying to use "20 to 25" </span><span class="s3">China UnionPay</span><span class="s1"> bank cards, all of which had different account holders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The person was arrested on suspicion of using stolen bank cards but was later released after the named card holders told detectives that they had given that person the authority to use the cards," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This was just one case, and there have been a significant - and rising - number like it ever since Macau introduced ‘know-your-customer' facial recognition technology earlier this year," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday night, in response to a set of detailed questions, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said: "We don't have comments on this."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response to the same questions, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Police said: " Police maintain close liaison with the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> and the financial industry to monitor and respond to any changes in financial crime trends."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The rise in local withdrawals since the facial recognition technology was introduced in Macau follows a move by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to instruct local banks to submit data on cash withdrawals by UnionPay cards throughout the city's ATM network as the regulator cracks down on unauthorised capital outflow from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Media reports - not denied by the authority - said the instruction meant commercial banks were required to submit data and documentation regarding the volume and timing of withdrawals by UnionPay cards for the first six months of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Monetary Authority insists it "has no plans'' to install facial recognition technology in the city's ATMs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland authorities have been strengthening regulations since last year when a decline in the value of the renminbi led to widespread capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland people are allowed to withdraw up to 100,000 yuan (HK$117,000) in renminbi overseas and remit up to US$50,000 worth of foreign currency offshore annually, according to the country's 2016 foreign exchange regulations.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks finished lower Friday afternoon as the Chinese currency sank to a four-year low, with onshore yuan now trading at a level weaker than that seen in the wake of the summer devaluation on August 11.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In afternoon trade, the onshore yuan eased to 6.4498 per US dollar, breaching the intraday low of 6.4486 seen on August 12. The offshore yuan traded at 6.5204, hovering just above the four-year lows touched on August 25 despite having breached the number at Thursday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index was at 21,554.74 at the afternoon recess, falling 0.69 per cent or 149.87 points from Thursday's close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, dipped by 1.33 per cent or 125,80 points to 9,324.69.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Investors are worried about whether there will be continuing capital outflow," said Ben Kwong Man-bun, director of KGI Asia. "Investors remain relatively cautious and sceptical whether there will be further downward pressure."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical</span><span class="s1">, said in separate statements filed Friday on the website of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1">, that their shares would be suspended from trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No reason was given for the trading suspension, although they follow reports Thursday that Fosun Group chairman Guo Guangchang could not be contacted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kwong called the trading suspension an "individual incident," explaining that the markets are largely being affected by the plunge in the yuan and the impending decision next week by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> on whether or not to raise interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The local markets are quite sensitive to the interest rate movement in the United States," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed Fosun International is the parent company and investment arm of Fosun Group. Subsidiary Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical is dual-listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fosun International</span><span class="s1"> shares traded on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> ended 11.4 per cent lower in Thursday's session.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other Hong Kong action, miners were down 1.96 per cent, insurance fell 1.62 per cent, and health and personal care were off 1.56 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> fell 2.13 per cent HK$41.35 and Tencent fell 0.598 per cent to HK$149.5. </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> shares were also down, easing 0.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many sectors are losers today because investors don't want to buy at the moment. Insurance, those infrastructure stocks, some pharmaceutical stocks...I think the weakness will continue until the Fed meeting," Kwong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s two-day policy board meeting for December is slated to get underway December 15.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China stocks also closed slightly lower, with the Shanghai Composite Index closing at 3,425.79 down 0.86 per cent or 29.71 points and the CSI300, which tracks large companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, falling 0.71 per cent or 25.6 points to close at 3,597.48.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen Composite Index closed 0.61 per cent lower, shedding 13.45 points to end at 2,198.41.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the yuan's reference rate at 6.4358, weaker by 122 basis points from Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas markets were generally upbeat on Thursday, with New York stocks advancing even as oil prices fell below US$37 per barrel for the first time since the global recession of the late 2000s.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 82.45 points, or 0.47 per cent, to close on Thursday at 17,574.75, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.61 points, or 0.23 per cent to 2,052.23, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 22.31 points or 0.44 per cent to 5,045.17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The January contract for West Texas Intermediate crude settled at US$36.76 a barrel, easing 1.1 per cent or 40 US cents, during Thursday's session on the </span><span class="s3">New York Mercantile Exchange</span><span class="s1">. The closing price was the lowest for a front-month oil contract since February 2009, and reflects the fifth trading session in a row that prices have fallen.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Country Garden, the Guangdong-based property developer, has splashed out HK$2.44 billion (US$312.3 million) on a 60 per cent share of a waterfront residential site at Ma On Shan in Hong Kong, marking the company's second investment in the city within four months, despite stricter capital outflow controls by Chinese government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share has been bought from Hong Kong's </span><span class="s3">Wang On Properties</span><span class="s1"> by Country Garden subsidiary Angel View, and the site - at Yiu Sha Road, Whitehead, along the eastern coast of Tolo Harbour in Hong Kong's New Territories - has an estimated gross floor area of 387,500 square feet</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That represents HK$10,500 per square foot and Wang On said the buyer has already paid 10 per cent of the total price as a deposit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are very bullish about Hong Kong's property market,” said Country Garden's chief financial officer Wu Bijun.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment comes just weeks after the mainland government requested Chinese investors needed special approval from Beijing to plough money into overseas property, in an effort to curb capital flight. The policy sparked initial concerns that mainland capital would disappear from Hong Kong's real estate market.We always start with small projects in cooperation with respectable local partnersStatement within Country Garden's interim results briefing last month</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Wu said his firm had enough offshore capital to fund the Ma On Shan purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Wang On's statement, the Hong Kong developer has also agreed to advance a loan of HK$600 million to Angel View, at a 0.7 annual interest rate over 12-month HIBOR, for 24 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Country Garden entered the Hong Kong market in June for the first time, acquiring a redevelopment project in Kowloon City for HK$610 million. The company also has residential projects in Malaysia and Australia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During its interim result briefing last month, the Hong Kong-listed Guangdong developer said it had a very prudent overseas investment strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We always start with small projects in cooperation with respectable local partners,” the company said at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ma On Shan site's development has actually seen a series of twists and turns in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland developer China City Construction (International) was forced to sell the plot, won in a 2014 government tender, to Wang On in June, after encountering financial difficulties to proceed with construction, amid Beijing's tightened controls on capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang On paid HK$2.7 billion for the whole site at that time, by transferring 60 per cent to Country Garden, meaning the latest development has pocketed a tidy profit of around HK$800 million for the former, in just three months. It said at the time it planned to create a development of luxury flats and villas.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese yuan strengthened slightly on Tuesday morning, rebounding after falling through the important technical level of 6.7 per US dollar on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan in Shanghai stood at 6.6985 against the US dollar at 10.05am, 0.04 per cent or 28 basis points stronger from a day earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan in Hong Kong weakened a little, down 12 pips or 0.02 per cent to 6.7096 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday set the yuan reference point at 6.6971 against the US dollar, down 10 basis points from Monday's fix, and its lowest level in almost six years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade on shore yuan at up to 2 per cent either side of the reference point for the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the onshore yuan hit 6.7096 per dollar in evening trade, breaching the critical technical level of 6.7 for the first time since September 2010, according to data from Reuters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The onshore yuan is still in a depreciation channel. Fundamentals, such as China's slowing economic growth and natural capital outflow remain unchanged. The central bank also seems to tolerate the gradual weakening of yuan," Tommy Ong, DBS Hong Kong's executive director of wealth management solutions, said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But speculative activities have reduced a lot. We did not see many short sellers of yuan in offshore market," Ong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ong said a level of 6.83 against the US dollar is critical for the onshore yuan, where it has hovered for two years since financial crisis in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the international markets, the British pound was down 0.27 per cent to US$1.3219 on Tuesday, reflecting a reversion from its recent rising streak. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37 per cent to 105.76 against the greenback, after it dropped to a one-month low at 106.32 per dollar on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should be prepared for a new round of capital outflows and currency depreciation when bracing for the impact of the trade war with the US and other disturbances to the financial markets, a prominent economist warned on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu Yongding, a senior researcher with the </span><span class="s3">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span><span class="s1"> and a former adviser to the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said “some disturbing factors” had emerged in the Chinese financial markets, such as the wave of peer-to-peer lending defaults or concerns about a property bubble and an economic slowdown in the second half of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The trade war with the US will have a negative impact on China's economy and market sentiment, as will the impact of interest rate increases in the US and the financial crisis in emerging markets, Yu told a financial forum in northeastern province of Heilongjiang. A link to the transcript was posted on the forum's official website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also warned of the risks of the plunging Turkish lira after US President Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminium tariffs on Turkey[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2159259/turkish-currency-craters-donald-trump-threatens-new-tariffs] amid ongoing political tensions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The lira, which fell 16 per cent against the US dollar on Friday, also took its toll on the European financial markets, weakening the euro and rouble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There have been discussions among investment bankers whether there would be a repeat of the Asian Financial Crisis. The so-called herd effect [like that] in the [1997] Asian financial crisis may affect China,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking those factors together, Yu warned that the yuan exchange rate “would face downward pressure which may reinforce the depreciation expectations”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think maybe we should be prepared for a new round of capital outflow and yuan deprecation. This may not happen, but we should prevent the problems before they happen,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Saturday marked the third anniversary of the central bank's decision to allow freer fluctuation of the yuan against the US dollar and other currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank engineered a depreciation of 2 per cent in consecutive three days starting on August 11, 2015, but insufficient communications with the market players triggered panic and led to continuous capital outflows amid fears of an economic slowdown.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yu suggest the authorities check “carefully” any possible channels or loopholes for huge capital outflows and also prevent digital currencies from being leveraged as a new tool for the capital exodus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The government has done quite well and is very sophisticated in managing cross-border capital flow,” said Yu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy report on Friday that China would not use currency devaluation as a defensive weapon to counter the turmoil of the US trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank also warned that the trade war would hit exports and possibly market sentiment and could exacerbate turbulence in the financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan depreciated 5.0 per cent against the US dollar in the second quarter, reversing a strengthening of 3.9 per cent in the first three months, the central bank said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid the ongoing trade tensions and slower economic growth, the Chinese currency has continued to test the key 7.0 level against the US dollar since last month when it saw a strong wave of depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week the central bank moved to raise the costs of foreign exchange speculation to prevent the yuan's further sliding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Yu said it was “irrational that everyone is obsessed with a particular number” and said there was no difference whether the dollar exchange rate was 7 or 6.9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It seems the central bank could send a signal to the market that it is not its goal to defend the yuan above 7 against the dollar” said Yu, who ruled out the likelihood of a massive depreciation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He suggested the People's Bank should improve its communications with the market to appease market sentiment but continue to refrain from regular market intervention.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The time is now right to allow greater volatility in the Chinese currency's exchange rate with the dollar, a state-run newspaper said in a front-page commentary, signalling that Beijing's concerns over the sharp depreciation in the yuan are easing as the greenback's value slides.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has been on the defensive over the value of the yuan for nearly two years after its abrupt two per cent devaluation of the currency in August 2015 roiled global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has taken a slew of measures, from draconian curbs on capital outflow to the adoption of opaque and complex changes to the yuan exchange regime, to keep the currency from weakening sharply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese yuan rises to 9-month high after US Fed holds rates steady[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2104335/chinese-yuan-rises-9-month-high-after-us-fed-holds-rates]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China Securities Journal, a newspaper run by the state-run </span><span class="s3">Xinhua</span><span class="s1"> news agency, said in an editorial on Tuesday that it was now time for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to tolerate greater volatility in the yuan exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The one-sided bet on yuan deprecation has been broken," the editorial said "Cross-border capital flow has been stabilised and improved in the first half, while supply and demand in the forex market has basically balanced - it is in the most balanced period for the past three years. It's good timing for China to boost yuan exchange rate flexibility in the short term."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has already advanced to a nine-month high against the US dollar. The US dollar index, which compares its value with a basket of currencies, now hovers at a near one-year low as the value of the greenback weakens.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves have also been stabilised at a level of US$3 trillion over the past months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> efforts to defeat those who bet on a big slump in the yuan, while successful at face value, have also invited suspicions over whether Beijing is peddling back on its market-oriented liberalisation of the exchange regime to a "managed floating system".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Xiaohui, an assistant governor at the central bank, wrote in an article published in the latest edition of China Finance, a central bank journal, that the authorities would "unswervingly" push ahead with yuan exchange rate liberalisation to give the market a decisive role in deciding the yuan's value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China Securities Journal editorial said Beijing's measures to bolster the value of the yuan were merely "temporary tools in a transitional period" and the direction of market-oriented reforms have not changed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dollar falls to its lowest level in more than a year[http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2103683/dollar-falls-its-lowest-level-more-year]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Jian, a senior analyst at the Bank of Communications in Shanghai, said a key move to increase flexibility was to expand the trading band, moving the yuan-to-dollar daily trading range to three per cent for the Euro, Japanese yen and other major currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore spot price is currently allowed to fluctuate within two per cent of the daily midpoint. The last expansion of the trading band from one per cent was announced in March 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, more than 60 per cent of daily fluctuations in trading so far this year were less than 0.1 per cent, according to data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fluctuations of more than 0.3 per cent were only recorded on 11 working days, with the one per cent level never breached.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To boost the two-way fluctuations, China needs to allow more players in the forex market and expand forex derivatives as well," said Liu.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's latest financial industry reform allowing some mainland residents to directly invest abroad through a pilot programme signals good news for Hong Kong's stock and property markets but may also bring new challenges for Leung Chun-ying, the city's next chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The milestone plan announced last week allows local residents in the small but wealthy city of Wenzhou in the east to make direct investments abroad - an effort that is also seen helping the country ease growing pressure to manage its more than US$3 trillion foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing did not mention any specific destination in the announcement for such investments from Wenzhou, but analysts say Hong Kong, rather than New York or London, will become rich mainlanders' first choice for investments under the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The property market in Hong Kong is likely to be the first to benefit because it is already a market that mainlanders are very familiar with and it is also very close to the mainland geographically," said Hu Yifan, chief economist at </span><span class="s3">Haitong International Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If you look back into the past decades, you will find Wenzhou people are interested in investing in two things - property and mining - and they like speculation in the markets," Hu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wenzhou is considered the birthplace of the mainland's private economy. Many Wenzhou businessmen are well known for their international trade and export all kinds of products - from sofas to soap - to places like Italy and Iraq. They made money initially from exports and then aggressively invested their wealth in properties. But the inflow of funds could exacerbate Hong Kong people's complaints about high property prices in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Newly elected chief executive Leung pledged to his supporters that he would help cool off a potential asset bubble and create more affordable apartments for local residents.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the benchmark Hang Seng Index has recovered slowly from the 2008 global financial crisis. Some investors and government officials have been concerned about a possible capital outflow of the stock market amid economic slowdown on the mainland and the worsening debt crisis in Europe, with a negative impact on Hong Kong's export business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Ligang, chief economist for Greater China at Australian bank ANZ, believed the new investment rules for Wenzhou residents would bring in fresh capital inflow in both the equity and housing markets in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently, Wenzhou holds US$56 billion in bank deposits and about US$190 billion in housing stock, according to Liu's research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If just 5 per cent of these holdings flow to the Hong Kong market, it will deliver a significant boost to Hong Kong's equity and housing market," said Liu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new investment rules for Wenzhou could be expanded nationwide if the pilot programme can make a smooth start, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Tianjin, two of the mainland's richest cities, have also lobbied the central government for similar policy support.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> is warning bankers and investors to beware of the risks of a US rate rise later this year despite the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> opting to keep interest rates flat on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile currency traders believe a rate rise will not come before June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US Federal Open Market Committee maintained interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Wednesday. The committee acknowledged that the US economy continued to progress towards the Fed's policy objectives of maximum employment and price stability, bolstering the case for gradually raising interest rates this year,” according to a spokesman for the HKMA, the de facto central bank of Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The gradual normalisation of US interest rates may have an impact on global capital flows, exchange rates and asset markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We continue to remind banks, corporates and individuals to remain vigilant and manage risks prudently so as to cope with potential changes in capital flows and market volatility arising from future increases in US interest rates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The authority's warning echoed that of Chan Ka-keung, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury. He said the expected interest rate rise would be one of the major challenges faced by Hong Kong's investment market this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US is expected to have several interest rate raises this year,” Chan said. “Under the currency peg, Hong Kong would need to follow the US in increasing its own interest rates. This would add more uncertainties to the local investment markets. Investors would need to make a cautious investment approach this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam warned in December that once the US started the cycle of increasing interest rates, it could lead to an outflow of capital from Hong Kong stock and property markets as some of the US$130 billion of hot money that has entered the city since 2008 starts to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> decided to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday in its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office two weeks ago. While it has not said when it will increase the interest rate again, it suggested the economy is doing well, indicating it is on track for further interest rate rises later this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late,” the Fed said in a statement after the meeting, where it was unanimously decided to leave the benchmark interest rate in a range of 0.50 per cent to 0.75 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Federal Open Market Committee raised rates in December for only the second time in a decade and forecast three rate increases in 2017, ending an era of cheap funding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo, chief strategist of King International, said the next rate rise will probably come in June.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to the futures market, about 70 per cent of traders believe there may be an interest rate rise in June, more than 70 per cent believe it will happen in July while almost 100 per cent believe it will happen before December,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lo said speculation of a US interest rate rise in the coming year would bring more volatility to markets in both currencies and stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US interest rate rise would support the US dollar, so the decision not to change it on Wednesday has led the US dollar to slide against other currencies. But then, when the interest rate rise happens, maybe from June, the US dollar may strengthen again,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We should note that the euro and pound sterling will face selling pressure from March onwards after the Brexit negotiations start and many European elections begin. Investors need to be careful when they are trading in the markets,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Fung, executive director of </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1">, said the first US rate increase is likely to be in May or June, with the market apparently pricing in three increases rather than two this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not think two or three increases of a quarter per cent in the US dollar interest rate will have an impact on Hong Kong commercial rates. The effective mortgage rate should remain stable in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The one month HIBOR [Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate] is capped by a large aggregate balance in the banking system where there is ample liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong dollar is trading in a range of 7.7550 to 7.7650 per US dollar. I personally do not feel a widening of three quarters of a per cent in the interest rate can trigger a big enough capital outflow to weaken the Hong Kong dollar to its lowest permitted level of 7.8500. Hence, a significant rise in the one month HIBOR and the prime rate is unlikely too.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">President Trump's economic expansion policies, including infrastructure spending, tax cuts and trade deals, are expected to lead to higher inflation and hence more interest rate increases in the this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US Fed chair Janet Yellen recently said the economy was solid, with near full employment. She said the Fed risked a “nasty surprise” in terms of inflation if it is too slow to raise interest rates.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Forget fancy buildings and go for start-ups at low rents in the Lok Ma Chau Loop, the Hong Kong government has been told.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead of buildings with shiny glass walls and elaborate designs, like those run by Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks at Tai Po, what start-ups really need is something cheaper and more basic, businessmen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If you look at all the technology areas in the Asia-Pacific ­region, you will find the rental cost in Hong Kong is much higher than elsewhere,” said Hilton Law Yiu-chung, chief executive officer of science parks-based start-up Integrated Solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“What start-ups need is very simple: shelter, water, electricity and a stable internet connection. We don't need to work in landmark buildings.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One of the men behind Cafe X, a start-up that makes coffee vending machines manned by robotic arms, shares similar views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although the office space was great for our software engineers and our hardware team when working in [computer-aided design], it was a challenge to build and assemble a large complex product in the space given,” co-founder Henry Hu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would recommend the science and technology parks designate a small amount of mixed-use space so start-ups working on large hardware products can have a garage-like space to fabricate, assemble and test their products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Law said buildings with glass walls were more expensive to maintain and prone to problems such as leakage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added there would also be need to accommodate workers in hostels and dormitories, not luxurious developments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The construction of the three phases of the science park cost HK$11.5 billion, and rents range from HK$14 per square foot to HK$37 per square foot. However, it also offers discounted rents to about 250 start-ups for up to four years in an incubation scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nicholas Brooke, former chairman of the parks board, agreed and said if he were to ­oversee the development again, he would have considered more ­flexible options such as prefabricated buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brooke said he would like to see the loop acting as an experiment for a new form of technology zone, with no walls separating ­different elements such as education, technology research and housing, so those with different expertise could mix and mingle in daily life.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I see it as a new model from a planning perspective where we weave these different elements all together,” he said. “It should be planned and designed as a community. I will be looking at doing something different, and certainly not creating a traditional park, ­because I don't think, in the longer term, that's the solution.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brooke said the loop would be a good opportunity for Hong Kong and Shenzhen to draw on each other's strengths.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said Hong Kong had been strong in education, research and commercialisation, while Shenzhen had done better in prototyping, testing, manufacturing and delivering a market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, an academic specialising in high-tech research hoped the central government would relax its restrictions on capital outflow so the new technology hub can rein in large sums of ­investment from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Professor Michael Yu Wang, founding director of the Robotics Institute at the Hong Kong ­University of Science and Technology, said what the city really needs is banknotes, rather than brains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are not short of talents here. I know the [Hong Kong] ­government is stepping up ­support for innovation and ­technology, but it's far from enough compared to other parts of the ­region,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong practises “one country, two systems”, the city is considered “foreign land” when it comes to absorbing ­capital from state enterprises, hampering efforts to rein in funds from technology hungry ­investors, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Sometimes our people have to travel to Shenzhen to work and collaborate with our mainland counterparts to get around this hurdle.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China intended to issue a digital currency as soon as possible, the central bank said yesterday, a move that could help the yuan offset the global dominance of the US dollar and limit capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> came as it wrapped up a symposium on digital currency in Beijing, where it discussed issuance frameworks and related technologies such as encryption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a statement summarising the forum and posted on its website, the bank said the currency could reduce the costs involved in circulating banknotes, facilitate economic activities and help combat money-laundering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A virtual currency would also help the bank improve control of the money supply and payment efficiency, it added</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking the step would thrust China into largely uncharted waters. Ecuador last year became the first nation to issue state-backed digital money. All of the banks in the tiny South American country have been told to get behind the push.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hao Hong, chief China strategist at the Bank of Communications, said China's attitude towards digital currency had been shifting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central government came out sharply against Bitcoin in 2013, forbidding payment companies from accepting it. It later relented somewhat, and allowed Bitcoin exchanges, but banks must still give it wide berth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The attitude towards digital currency in China has been shifting, it has been surprising," Hong said. Back then it was quite hostile. Now, facing capital outflow pressure, a digital currency would make it easier to check the capital flow."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-backed cryptocurrency would also allow the yuan to challenge the hegemony of the greenback, he said, but cautioned that would take time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US dollar has the luxury of pricing everything, every commodity, in US dollars. That is why it can maintain a power grip on the global economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">PBOC chairman Zhou Xiaochuan, who attended the forum in Beijing, floated the idea of an alternative to the American dollar in 2009, saying it could be a "super-sovereign" currency based on the reserve asset of the International Monetary Funds. The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> announced the renminbi would take its place alongside the US dollar, the yen, the British pound and the euro that comprise the special drawing rights basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But even with yuan's inclusion, China's efforts to dethrone the dollar in the existing international currency system have made very little progress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Ben Bernanke, the former US Fed chairman, told a forum in Hong Kong this week that Beijign's interest in creating an alternative to the greenback wouldn't work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a digital currency could gain traction at the domestic level. Payments for goods and services are increasingly becoming digital with new applications and online players jostling for a position in the potentially lucrative sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhang Weichao, the director of "mining" at Huobi.com, China's major platform for virtual currency trading, said a cryptocurrency might be popular with consumers. "</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It can be popular among the people - [if] it's endorsed by the government and convenient to use with new technologies."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu Zhibing, the chief operating officer at Haoyouqian.com, a crowd-funding startup in Beijing, said digital money is "definitely the future".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China must seize the first-mover advantage to get on board - the central bank would be a sinner of the whole nation if other countries moved ahead while China lagged behind."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fan Yifei, a deputy central bank governor, attended the symposium as well. Experts from </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1"> and Deloitte were invited to attend the meeting as well.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Exchange Fund reported a loss of HK$18.3 billion, its second worst performance ever and its first loss since 2008, as heavy foreign exchange losses and poor returns from stock investments took a toll.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first time in a decade, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA), which uses the HK$3.7 trillion Exchange Fund to defend the Hong Kong dollar peg to the US dollar, has been forced to intervene in the market in recent days to prevent the currency from weakening too much.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar hit an 8-year low at 7.8294 on Wednesday, dangerously close to the weak end of the peg band at 7.85. Capital outflow from the stock markets and concerns over economic weakness have put pressure on the Hong Kong currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The poor returns of the fund - announced by chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam on Friday - and the weak currency have come as a double blow for the HKMA, the city's de facto cental bank. The HKMA invests the fund, which includes the government's fiscal reserves and other assets, in stocks, bonds and property.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund lost HK$18.3 billion from its investments last year, compared with gains of HK$43.6 billion in 2014, HK$75.9 billion in 2013, HK$111.6 billion in 2012 and HK$26.7 billion in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index lost 7.3 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund's rate of return was 1.4 per cent in 2014, 2.7 per cent in 2013, 4.4 per cent in 2012 and 1.1 per cent in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund lost 0.6 per cent last year, which was its second loss on record. Before that it had reported a loss of 5.6 per cent in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is likely to reach a free trade agreement with the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1"> (ASEAN) by this year, said Financial Secretary John Tsang.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The 10 nations covered by a free-trade pact represent a population of some 600 million of rising middle class status. We view the pact with strategic importance," Tsang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We started the negotiations last year. We believe with two or three more meetings, we should be able to resolve most outstanding issues."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang also said Hong Kong has discussed its plans to become a member of the </span><span class="s3">Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</span><span class="s1">, and the response from the central government in Beijing has been positive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Allaying fears of capital outflow that has hammered the local currency in recent days, Tsang said: "As the US rate policy normalises, the Hong Kong-US interest rate differential will see further widening. We have previously seen US$13 billion of inflows. As rates normalise, it will result in outflows, this is normal and should not be a cause for concern."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang's comments came at an economic forum held by the </span><span class="s3">Chinese General Chamber of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> on Friday. At the same forum, Yue Yi, vice-chairman and chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong) </span><span class="s1">said banks' businesses were constrained by high financing costs when the yuan appreciated for years in a one-way currency movement. The new two-way volatility. according to him, is helping Hong Kong banks to break "past limitations for the lending business".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change is creating a new market for interest rate derivatives, forex derivatives and swap products that are taking the yuan business for banks into a new stage, Yue said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tsang noted Hong Kong's economy will be challenged by sluggish global demands and lower tourist numbers in 2016. But Hong Kong will see "huge opportunities" under China's gradual opening of its capital account and see support from the city's infrastructure investments, which, he said, are happening at "full speed".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese property developers have seen their financing channels, both onshore and offshore, dry up over the past month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While domestic bond sales by property companies have been called off by the government to curb the overheated real estate market, foreign investors are stepping back from developers' dollar bonds after Donald Trump's shock win in the US presidential elections.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Country Garden, one of the country's largest developers, dropped its offering for a 10-year dollar-denominated bond altogether, with a coupon rate around 5.625 per cent, due to lacklustre investor demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was bad timing," said Witter Zhong, Country Garden's investor relations officer.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It had issued a seven-year US$650 million bond in September, with a 4.75 per cent coupon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yields on global bonds, including </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> notes, have risen sharply in the past fortnight amid a panic selling, as investors priced in an acceleration in inflation after Trump's triumph.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors are now treating high-yield bonds very cautiously and are increasingly selective, while chasing much higher yield, said Tony Chen, credit analyst at </span><span class="s3">Nomura Holdings</span><span class="s1"> in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">TThe Chinese property sector has been the largest source of junk bonds in Asia.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Country Garden case is a turning point," Chen said. "Demand for offshore issuance is surging, but many have failed."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong-listed mainland developers have been shifting their focus from offshore to onshore borrowing since late last year, when the Chinese authorities reopened the domestic bond market to developers to provide them with ample liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But they are returning as the domestic market worsens. Bond-raising applications have been practically frozen after reports said the authorities, including the National Development and Reform Commission Shanghai Stock Exchange, had tightened bond issuance requirements last month.The Chinese government has an urgency to crack down on home prices, and the measures have to be toughAlan Jin, a property analyst at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Securities</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Domestic bonds sold by Chinese developers so far this month have tumbled to US$715 million by deal value, or 5 by deal numbers, compared to US$7.2 billion, and 38 deals in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the March-September period, every month's deal volume has surpassed US$10 billion, according to data provider Dealogic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Chinese government has an urgency to crack down on home prices, and the measures have to be tough," said Alan Jin, a property analyst at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Developers still have cash in hand after enjoying a year of strong sales and a loosened credit environment - but they are gradually turning to offshore funding that will push up yields, Jin said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are pretty negative over the sector's outlook."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As well as surging dollar bond yields, the rapid depreciation of the yuan against the dollar has cast a further shadow over Chinese developers, as they generate their revenue in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nomura's Chen said for some smaller developers with tighter capital chains, exchange losses cannot be taken into account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that many developers have needed to refinance their outstanding dollar bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Chinese regulators have implemented stricter controls on capital outflow, and now they have to issue new debt, to repay the existing debts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According TF Securities, Chinese developers currently have 197 dollar bonds outstanding, worth a total issuance value of US$85.1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chen said domestic bond sales are unlikely to be restarted before year-end, and the demand for offshore issuance will accelerate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But, investors and developers still need to wait until the market stabilises so that they can reach a price that both satisfied, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An expected interest rate rise in June is likely to force more developers and homeowners, alike, to dig in and not sell their new and second-hand flats, adding more pressure on the Hong Kong government to introduce a levy on unoccupied properties to increase supply, according to leading market watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po last month unveiled the government is considering imposing the tax, in a bid to cool the city's red-hot property prices and make more properties available.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Owners of empty flats could be taxed under new plan to tackle Hong Kong's housing shortage[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2137404/hong-kong-mulls-tax-vacant-properties-unsold-flats-pile-red]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It makes sense to consider such a tax, as Hong Kong has a real lack of properties, while some developers and secondary homeowners are holding back on selling some empty units,” said Clement Chan Kam-wing, managing director of accounting firm BDO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many overseas cities such as Melbourne have imposed similar taxes in the hope of helping to increase supply and make prices more reasonable,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said an empty flat tax may now be more urgent than ever, as a new interest rate cycle looks like developing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many [developers and homeowners] may prefer to hold on, to wait and see if the interest rate rise cycle ends up being short-lived. They would only be forced into selling, if rates rise to very high levels,” Chan said.It makes sense to consider such a tax, as Hong Kong has a real lack of properties, while some developers and secondary homeowners are holding back on selling some empty unitsClement Chan Kam-wing, managing director of accounting firm BDO</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the current pegging system, as well as its currency, Hong Kong's base lending interest rate (the rate at which banks borrow from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1">, the HKMA) has to be synchronised with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKMA last month lifted that to 2 per cent, up 25 basis points, in line with the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> rate, marking a sixth rise since December 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even that modest rise, however, may not be enough to convince developers and buyers to start selling, Chan added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest government statistics show the number of empty flats not sold or leased by developers rose to 9,500 at the end of last year, nearly double the 5,000 registered at the start of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That increase in empty units shows there's a need now to put pressure on developers to sell,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is worth pointing out, too, that all the city's commercial banks have remained resolute not to lift their best lending rates for individuals and companies, in line with the base rate, with those still rooted at a historical low of 5 per cent, where they have now been for a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That's because no bank wants to take the lead and lift lending rates, as that could drive customers away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If and when the Fed and HKMA increase the base rate for the seventh consecutive time in June, as expected, that may force them to act,” added Jasper Lo Cho-yan, a senior vice-president at iBest, which is part of </span><span class="s3">Haitong International Securities</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The growing trade tensions between the US and China could also prompt a Hong Kong stock market sell off, and any capital outflow can then lead to lending rate rises.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In that case, he added, homeowners intending to sell could be forced into offloading their properties, if they started to find paying their mortgages more difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The last time </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> changed its best lending rate was back on November 10, 2008, when the lender sliced it a quarter point.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Even the best lending rates could be raised to 5.5 or 6 per cent, still well away from what might be considered ‘painful' levels,” Lo said. “Remember, the record high lending rate remains 19.61 per cent, in October 1981.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the other obvious way of forcing more to put their properties up for sale, would be an</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">empty flat tax.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If that was set high, developers may immediately put more completed flats onto the market, with more on the secondary market opting to lease or sell, too. That would immediately increase supply, and likely lead to lower prices.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing will soon issue a new rule governing individual mainland investors' direct investments in Hong Kong stocks, according to two people with knowledge of the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They said financial regulators were giving priority to the implementation of the qualified domestic individual investors (QDII2) scheme, which could spark a multibillion-yuan outflow into the city's market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The QDII2 programme, similar to an earlier proposal for a "through train" system that never came to pass, would allow mainland investors to open brokers' accounts in Hong Kong to trade on its stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sources said the QDII2 plan would materialise as early as March, after the National People's Congress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technically, there are no barriers to its launch," one person briefed by senior officials said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's certain there'll be no about-face this time."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In August 2007, the country's foreign exchange regulator said it would let individual mainland investors buy Hong Kong stocks directly, but the plan was scrapped in July 2010, as officials feared that the resulting capital outflow would hurt domestically-listed A shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said on January 11 that work on a trial run of QDII2 was under way, the first time Beijing officially said it would put the "through train" back on its agenda.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The QDII2 scheme is believed to be linked to the B-H share conversions proposed by the mainland securities regulator.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing is encouraging companies with B shares - traded in US dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen - to relist in Hong Kong amid a lack of liquidity and buying interest in the B-share market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A QDII2 scheme could let former holders of B shares trade stocks in Hong Kong after the firms are relisted in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland regulators have yet to unveil a total quota for QDII2 investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts expect capital outflows in the QDII2 programme to have minimal impact on A shares, which trade in yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A multibillion-yuan fund outflow wouldn't be enough to affect the mainland market," Z-Ben Advisors chief researcher Howhow Zhang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Mainland investors are more worried about a flood of A-share initial public offerings that could siphon hundreds of billions of yuan from the market while diluting the prices of the existing stocks."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Citic Capital</span><span class="s1">, the Chinese state-owned asset management firm, is looking to accelerate its overseas investment in Britain, the United States and Japan to meet growing demand from clients, despite China stepping up its efforts at tightening capital outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Chinese investors needing to put capital overseas for diversification, will continue to be a sign of the times," Stanley Ching, head of real estate at </span><span class="s3">Citic Capital</span><span class="s1">, told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added the investment house is on track to make investments in the UK, the US and Japan, and is also looking at opportunities in Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Established in 2005, </span><span class="s3">Citic Capital</span><span class="s1">'s real estate business has been largely focused on the mainland market in the past, investing in some 20 projects with a collective asset value of over US$8 billion mainly in residential, retail and commercial properties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In May, however, it teamed up with China's Cindat Capital Management to buy a major stake in an ongoing, 32-unit luxury London residential property development project being built at 60 Curzon Street in London, for around US$155 million.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although its first London project has been hit by pound's Brexit plunge, Ching said </span><span class="s3">Citic Capital</span><span class="s1"> will continue to push on with its invest activities in Britain and elsewhere in the West.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"What we do is long-term investment, usually 5 to 8 years. It is difficult to hedge currency risks for such a long period, and our investors are fully aware of that," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But we won't become over-leveraged - that could become a serious problem."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan fell on Thursday morning after </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> set its mid-price lower for the ninth day running, as it dropped to its weakest level in 19 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders were focused on the US, where stocks fell, and whether officials there will brand the Chinese as currency manipulators by weakening the yuan as a weapon to fight against the impact of the ongoing trade war between the nations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan traded by international investors dropped 0.23 per cent to 6.9407 to the US dollar in early trade, while onshore yuan traded by the mainland traders fell 0.13 per cent to 6.9242.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mid-price was 6.9098, its lowest since March 15, 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government will not loosen its measures to cool the property market for now because the economy and sources for local investment will remain uncertain for months to come, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka Keung[http://www.gov.hk/en/about/govdirectory/po/sfst.htm] said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan told the Post that some property sales figures have softened. Still, it is only a correction from very strong growth of past years, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When we launched stamp duty to curb the overheating property markets, prices had risen sharply," Chan said. "It will take time for the government to assess if market conditions have really changed to enable us to relax these measures. It is too soon to make a decision."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government introduced a special stamp duty — a tax on property — in 2012 to curb an overheating stock market as money inflows and Chinese-mainland buyers pushed property prices back towards a peak of 1997.When we launched stamp duty to curb the overheating property markets, prices had risen sharply. It will take time for the government to assess if market conditions have really changed to enable us to relax these measures. It is too soon to make a decisionSecretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka Keung</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four years on and the market has turned. Economic slowdown on the mainland has cut buyers' appetite. In December the first US interest rate rise in a decade caused capital outflow from Hong Kong. The local currency once hit an eight-and-a-half year low against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said this year's retail and export figures were poor while the stock market in Hong Kong has been volatile.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Looking ahead, we expect the economy and investment markets to remain full of risk and volatility," Chan said. "The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> indicated last week that it would slow the interest rate rise pace which has helped improve market sentiment. However, there are still worries about the interest rate rises this year."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors should be aware of the risks and potentially unexpected market moves when they make any investment choice, he said. Poor market sentiment may also affect new listings and mergers and acquisitions, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, we won't worry too much in the longer term because of the cross border trading scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland and other mainland reforms that will prove beneficial to the long-term growth of the city," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new year does not close the book on the old. Two recent landmark events in Paris set contrasting tones for 2016 - optimism sparked by a positive outcome to last month's world climate summit, tempered by the horror of November's terrorist attack that killed 130 people. They set the stage for 2016 to be the year the world must cooperate to confront the reality of global warming and the threat to world order of violent extremism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even without these challenges, 2016 would remain a defining year, with a rising interest-rate cycle amid a slowdown in China, the election of a new US president, the first elections for the Hong Kong legislature since it rejected political reform proposals, elections in Taiwan next month that are expected to return the pro-independence opposition to power, and the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March, which will consider detailed measures to ensure stable economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Domestically, President Xi Jinping needs to deepen his anti-corruption campaign while dealing with the economic slowdown; externally, he faces a more complicated international environment amid leadership changes and continuing tensions in the South China Sea.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elections here and abroad</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, Democratic Party front runner Hillary Clinton is no stranger to Beijing and other world capitals, unlike the field of candidates for the Republican nomination. Front runner Donald Trump has confounded conventional notions of credibility with an unpresidential image shaped by offensive remarks about migrants and women and insultingly undiplomatic criticism of China. That said, the eventual nominee often leaves such rhetoric behind on the campaign trail, and China- bashing is a well-established standby for US election candidates seeking to lay the blame for America's problems.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Taiwan, President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of opening up to the mainland is not seen to have improved the lives of ordinary people, and his historic meeting with Xi has not dented Democratic Progressive Party candidate Tsai Ing-wen's lead in the polls. This has enabled her to put cross-strait relations to one side, pledging adherence to the "status quo" and focusing on social and economic "justice". But ultimately her success as president will depend on developing a framework for managing relations with mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Locally, the assessment is not upbeat. Global conditions are likely to constrain the city's economic performance. The dent in the retail and other sectors caused by a downturn in tourist arrivals may put pressure on the labour market. The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s rate rise has also clouded the volatile residential property market. Social sentiment is equally unsettling. The public continues to be bombarded with vexed questions like inadequate housing supply, an ageing population, retirement protection and standard working hours legislation. Negative sentiment towards mainlanders my have eased with fewer arrivals, but remains cause for concern.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Politically, the city's fate for the next few years will be sealed when it returns a new legislature and the election committee for the chief executive poll towards the end of the year. It remains to be seen whether political forces in the new Legco will be realigned to make governance easier. More than a year has passed but the wounds opened by the political reform row and the 79-day Occupy protests have yet to heal. What is certain, though, is that governance in the coming months will become more difficult. Previous experience has shown that a wrong step by the government could become an election issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thanks to the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback and the beginning of a rate-rise cycle, analysts expect local interest rates to rise by 1 percentage point this year, despite the prospect of an economic slowdown. This would lead to potential capital outflow from the stock and property markets of up to US$130 billion in "hot money".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect scheme now more than a year old, the long-awaited scheme between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is expected to launch in the first half of the year, creating more cross-border trading and capital flows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Going for gold</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August may bring welcome relief from human conflict, politics and economic uncertainty. Hong Kong's brightest medal prospects lies with the city's cycling sweetheart Sara Lee Wai-sze, a bronze medallist in London four years ago. Other chances rest on the shoulders of Siobhan Haughey, who became the first swimmer from Hong Kong to reach the Olympic qualifying standard in more than half a century at the world championships this year, and runner Christy Yiu Kit-ching, who qualified for Rio when she set her personal best in the Prague Marathon in May.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Export woes may spur yuan rethinkSCMP headline, November 4</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To the pictures. In one line the first chart shows you the import growth rate of the United States and Europe combined and in the other line the export growth of the 10 largest economies of East Asia combined.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For those of you who want full technical definition, this represents three-month averages of year over percentage change in US dollar terms with re-exports excluded.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For those of you who want to know which is which, I'm not telling and you don't need to know. Call them Tweedledum and Tweedledee. They're effectively the same. When America and Europe want to buy, Asia sells. When they don't want to buy, Asia doesn't sell. The buyers set the pace and just now they don't really want to buy that much.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second chart breaks down the Asian export growth figures and here, in contrast, it is well worthwhile noting which is which. China leads. The rest of Asia follows. The growth rates of both have obviously come down from their 2010 peaks but China is still clearly gaining market share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now it is true that Beijing's currency policies have in recent years created yuan strength against other Asian currencies, particularly this year against the Japanese yen and the Indonesian rupiah, the one a hi-tech competitor, the other a low wages competitor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But then here is my question: if a weak national currency helps to boost a country's export performance as much as it supposedly does, how has a strong currency China continued to pick up export market share from weaker currency Asian competitors?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Answer: because China's currency of trade is not the yuan but the US dollar. It has always been thus and will continue to be as long as the central government's habit of poking around in things it doesn't understand makes it impossible to price industrial effort properly in yuan terms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has little impact anyway on China's exports. I would be surprised if the yuan value-added component has yet exceeded 10 per cent of the final retail sales price abroad. It consists of little more than assembly wages. Required imports account for much more and are US dollar-based.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Playing around with the yuan's exchange rate may thus give mandarins in Beijing great delight and wonderful delusions of importance but isn't likely to affect the trade picture much.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And they cannot really afford to weaken the yuan anyway. Last year saw a net capital outflow of US$96.5 billion, the first in 12 years, an inexplicable and uncomfortable experience for them. A big push on the yuan to encourage people to bring their money back then reversed this deficit and the capital account showed a US$105 billion surplus in the first half. Go soft on the yuan and that big deficit will just come right back again.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is not to mention that Beijing has further delusions of making the yuan a world reserve currency. The US dollar can go weak and still remain one but a weak yuan hasn't a hope.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In summary, no export woes that I can see but Beijing can always create them.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the opening of a key Communist Party[http://www.scmp.com/topics/chinas-communist-party] congress to present China's new leadership[http://www.scmp.com/chinas-leadership-reshuffle-2017] for the next five years less than one month away, the country's propaganda machine is in overdrive with blanket coverage on national television, print media and internet praising President Xi Jinping[http://www.scmp.com/topics/xi-jinping]'s wisdom, leadership and the resulting achievements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No fulsome adjective is spared, with superlatives such as "amazing", "outstanding" and "historic" freely employed to extol progress in the economic, social, environmental, cultural and diplomatic spheres over the past five years. The media praises the country's world-class bridges, tunnels, high-speed railways and satellites, as well as new trends in bike sharing and mobile payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The underlying message is clear: under Xi's leadership, the government has been able to pool national resources to achieve significant breakthroughs, a key advantage of the one-party dictatorship which gets things done and does not allow others to question decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Amid this campaign to eulogise the power of the government and the party, it is thus interesting to note that on Monday, the Chinese government made public its first set of guidelines to promote entrepreneurship, create a more favourable environment for entrepreneurs, and better protect their legal property and interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past few days, state media has lined up officials, economists and private business owners to validate the strategic importance of the guidelines, highlighting the timing of the release just before the party's 19th congress and the fact this is the first time such a document has been released in the name of both the party and the government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What to make of this? There is no better time for the Chinese government to advocate the entrepreneurial spirit than now, at this critical juncture when the country needs entrepreneurship and innovation to further upgrade and transform the economy to become a truly global economic power.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But rarely in recent years has entrepreneurship been more tested than now, depending on how one looks at the matter. From one angle, entrepreneurship in China has never been as strong as in the past two decades, a period that has brought dramatic changes and advances in technology and business models.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is represented by the rise of China's internet tycoons: Pony Ma of Tencent[http://www.scmp.com/topics/tencent], Ren Zhengfei of Huawei, Lei Jun of Xiaomi, and Jack Ma of Alibaba[http://www.scmp.com/topics/alibaba], owner of the South China Morning Post. They have in turn inspired a new generation of young people in their 20s and 30s with soaring aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From another angle, entrepreneurship has never appeared so dispirited and downtrodden. Various leading property and financial magnates and their companies stand accused of corruption and of colluding with corrupt officials to fleece the public coffers and engage in blatant frauds. Such cases have fanned public mistrust of the rich.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's private sector contributes more than 60 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product, about 50 per cent of tax revenues, and more than 80 per cent of jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But one astute commentator has pointed out that while the government, foreign direct investment and massive infrastructure spending are cited as key reasons for the spectacular rise of the Chinese economy, private sector development is often mentioned as an afterthought, something that happened as a result of China's economic success rather than the cause of it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, since 2016, private sector investment has fallen sharply, with reports of massive capital outflow amid the crackdown on official corruption and the party's renewed efforts to step up controls over business activities ahead of the five-yearly leadership changes scheduled for next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past two years the top leaders, including Xi and Premier Li Keqiang, have also repeatedly stressed the importance of encouraging and supporting private sector development, with the government promising private businessmen better market access and better protection of their rights. But progress has been slow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, the government in November released a landmark document, which was aimed at improving protection of private property rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among other measures, it promised to sift through and correct a number of outstanding cases in which private businessmen's property rights were violated. It also promised to go easy on those businessmen who were involved in illicit transactions or bribing officials in their earlier years, when the regulatory framework was weak and loopholes were plenty - the slip-ups known as "original sins".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But nearly one year has passed and there has been little development in that regard.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now the latest guidelines have gone one step further by promising to set up a national unified platform to help businesses protect and defend their rights, while also promising to create equal market access and streamline bureaucratic regulatory procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those guidelines may be high-sounding enough but they could prove hollow if concrete measures are not put in place and effectively enforced.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Homeowners in Hong Kong were bracing themselves for higher mortgage repayments as a string of the city's biggest banks raised their lending rates on Thursday for the first time in more than decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> followed an increase by Hong Kong's de facto central bank in its base lending rate in lockstep with an overnight move by the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">. The change formally brings to an end 12 years of unchanged lending rates in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The base lending rate was raised by 25 basis points to 2.5 per cent, the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> said on its website, effective immediately. It paved the way for the city's commercial banks to start raising their so-called prime rates, hitting homeowners in the pocket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will put an end to an era of extremely cheap lending and is set to bring volatility to the investment and property markets. It would be unrealistic to expect property prices to only go up,” said the de facto central bank's chief executive officer Norman Chan Tak-lam at a media briefing in Hong Kong early on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The public will need to be aware of the risks related to asset-price changes caused by the interest rate rise.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The base lending rate is the interest the HKMA charges commercial banks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest move by the Fed - the third in 2018, and the eighth since the end of so-called quantitative easing in December 2015 - had an immediate impact in Hong Kong, as some of the city's biggest lenders announced they were raising their prime rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That will translate to higher mortgage payments for loans that are tied to the prime rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> was the first to do so on Thursday morning, increasing its best lending rate by 12.5 basis points to 5.125 per cent, from 5 per cent, effective September 28.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HSBC raises Hong Kong prime rate for the first time in a decade[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2165920/hsbc-raises-hong-kong-prime-rate-first-time-decade-ending]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Standard Chartered</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> said they would increase their best lending rates by the same amount, to 5.375 per cent and 5.125 per cent respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's monetary policy is tied to the US to maintain the local currency's peg at HK$7.80 per US dollar. That means every move by the US Fed - one of the most publicised economic events on Earth - is mirrored in equal measure in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US central bank raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point overnight, and affirmed its outlook for further increases well into 2019[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2165891/us-federal-reserve-raises-rates-and-says-more-coming-brushing-trump].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said different banks would decide when and how much to increase their prime lending rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The rate rise will bring in uncertainties to Hong Kong,” he said, pointing to the property market. He added that other uncertainties include whether the US-China trade war will worsen and whether the US will speed up the pace of its increases in interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US [Fed] had expected to increase interest rate one more time this year and three more times next year. The Fed rate would go up to around 3 per cent while Hong Kong would follow suit. This is not excessive, but it is just to bring the interest rate from an extremely low level to a normal level. The Hong Kong economy and banking sector could cope with such movement,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said since April, there has been about a HK$100 billion capital outflow from Hong Kong, representing only about 10 per cent of the HK$1 trillion capital inflow since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The banking sector is still full of liquidity. The banks hold a combined HK$1 trillion Exchange Fund notes while the aggregated balance has over HK$70 billion. The liquidity means banks have no need to rush to increase the interest rate substantially.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US also plans to increase its interest rate gradually. The market may have volatilities during this process, but the economy should be able to cope with the rate rise. The normalisation of interest rates would allow the [Hong Kong] economy to grow in a more healthy manner,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a city lawmaker and stockbroker warned that the property market should brace itself.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The property market will have to prepare for a slowdown as the higher rate will add to homebuyers' mortgage payments,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are two types of mortgage loans in Hong Kong: those tied to the prime rate, or those tied to the interbank offered rate (Hibor).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cost of money in the city soared to a 10-year high on Thursday as it became harder for banks to obtain funds. The one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor), a measure of how much banks charge each other for short-term loans, added 6 basis points to 2.27 per cent, its highest level since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For prime-linked loans, the rate has remained between 5 per cent and 5.25 per cent, even while most commercial banks have already started to increase their rate for large deposit sums, as well as raise the payment for new borrowers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's outstanding mortgage loans stood at HK$1.26 trillion (US$161.3 billion) at the end of June, according to the monetary authority's data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan extended its losses for a seventh straight session on Friday morning after the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> set the midpoint lower for a third consecutive day, but analysts expect the central bank to soon take action to stabilise the currency hit by the simmering US-China trade dispute.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As China does not allow the yuan to trade freely, the central bank announces a midpoint every morning for the yuan against the US dollar and other currencies, allowing it to move up or down two per cent from the midpoint during the day.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan edged down to 6.5121 against the US dollar in early trading, down 0.26 per cent from Thursday's close at 6.4949, taking the overall losses to 2 per cent since last Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some traders believe the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would like to let the yuan to weaken further to boost exports amid the trade war.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the US presidential election less than two months away, a Daiwa economist has warned that a Donald Trump presidency could spell big trouble for China's economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Backed by a popular American view that the US has not received a fair deal since China joined the </span><span class="s3">World Trade Organisation</span><span class="s1"> in 2001, Trump advocates a four-point plan to reform US-China trade</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">policy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Top of the Trump agendahas been a threat to name China a currency manipulator. The candidate has also said he would force China to uphold intellectual property laws, end China's export subsidies, and cut domestic US corporate tax, the latter move helping to keep US jobs at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As part of his negotiating tactics to force China to acquiesce, Trump has advocated imposing a 45 per cent tariff on Chinese imports to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daiwa's Asia chief economist Kevin Lai said such a tariff policy, if it became reality, could mean as much as a 4.8 percentage point reduction in China's gross domestic product at a time when he sees the country delivering only 6.5 per cent growth this year, slowing to 6 per cent next year. And Beijing would be in no position to retaliate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“[China] would have to find somewhere else to sell its products. This would exacerbate the overcapacity issues in the economy, putting greater deflation pressure on China, while shrinking China's capital account surplus position,” Lai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> would have to respond with more aggressive policies [such as] cutting rates and printing money which will mean more pressure on the yuan. This will put pressure on China to depreciate the currency. It will be the opposite of what Trump wants to achieve,” said Lai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the tariffs became a permanent feature of Washington's China policy, Lai further warns that China would become a less attractive destination for foreign direct investments. In the wave of repatriation of investments to follow, the mainland could see a further 3.9 per cent reduction in its GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's exports to the US are four times bigger than [US exports to China],” he warned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lai explained that Beijing would be in no position to retaliate, even by selling its vast stock of US Treasuries the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> holds because that would only push US yields higher, making the US a more attractive investment destination and triggering even greater capital outflow from China.[China bashing] is getting quite popular. It may eventually be a majority opinionKevin Lai, Daiwa Asia chief economist</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's not just Trump's own idea. [China bashing] is getting quite popular. It may eventually be a majority opinion - the sentiment may be reflected in the votes,” Lai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lai doesn't expect new regional trade developments in Asia, including China's One Belt One Road policies or the establishment of the 16-country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement, as growth drivers that will offset the negative impact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, a Hong Kong-based economist speaking on condition of anonymity, disagreed with Lai's grim picture of vast capital outflows and GDP shock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Except for 2011, China has been running negative net export figures since 2009. There is no evidence that justifies the view that China's exports steals US jobs [that could justify the tariff policy],” the economist said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most foreign direct investment (FDI) in China is not even in export-related sectors anymore. The majority of investment flows are now intended for sectors that could sell into China's domestic markets. Also, FDI this year is actually negative. China now does more outbound investment than the inbound investment it has receives since last year.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland conglomerate CEFC China Energy, which owns one of Czech Republic's top football clubs Slavia Prague, has confirmed that the purchase of the club's stadium is completed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC China Energy, ranked as one of the mainland's ten largest private companies by China Daily in 2014, will make Eden Arena in Prague the home ground of the football club.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are not plundering the football market or talents, but making friends and seeking mutual development,” said CEFC's founder Ye Jianming, who is actively expanding his business overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company will invest €49.6 million (HK$420.2 million) to reconstruct the stadium over the next five years, according to reports. Another Chinese firm - Beijing Municipal Road &amp; Bridge Corporation - is said to be handling the reconstruction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several Chinese conglomerates have moved to invest in top overseas football clubs after President Xi Jinping showed great interest in boosting the football business in the world's most populous country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five major football club deals last year involved Chinese corporations. One of the highest-profile deals involved Recon Group, owned by Chinese businessman Tony Xia Jiantong, who invested £60 million (HK$603.2 million) to acquire a 100 per cent stake in English championship club </span><span class="s3">Aston Villa</span><span class="s1"> last May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, Wang Jianlin, founder of real estate developer Wanda Group, bought a 20 per cent share of Spanish powerhouse Atletico Madrid for €45 million. Later that same year, a consortium led by state-backed China Media Capital took a US$400 million (HK$3.1 billion) stake in Manchester City.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these big purchases have caused the central government to worry about capital outflow and the depreciation of the Chinese yuan. At the end of last year, the Chinese authorities said they intended to clamp down on such acquisitions, accusing domestic companies of transferring assets overseas under the cover of foreign club acquisition.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A Chinese energy company founded 15 years ago by an entrepreneur in his mid twenties had been quietly gobbling up energy assets across central Asia and eastern Europe for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike Anbang Group, </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">, Fosun Group and the </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">, which have come under close regulatory scrutiny since April for their global acquisitions, CEFC China Energy has largely stayed out of the spotlight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai company spent at least US$1.7 billion since 2015 buying energy-related businesses in Romania, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and even Chad, and another US$1.2 billion buying financial services in the Czech Republic and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Read: China's banking regulator orders loan checks on Wanda, Fosun, HNA, others[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2099565/chinas-banking-regulator-orders-loan-checks-wanda-fosan-hna]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What differs between CEFC and its better known -- and larger -- peers is that its acquisitions have hewed close to state policies, in particular Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt &amp; Road Initiative, which connects China's market and products all the way to Europe and Africa along a modern iteration of the Silk Road.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In so doing, CEFC not only escaped the wrath of state regulators wary of wayward asset buyers, it's also manage to secure government funding for the lion's share of its purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Beijing's main concern with so-called irrational overseas acquisition is that they may be dressed up as deals in line with the state's policy to encourage corporations to expand abroad, but are in reality transactions to facilitate capital outflow," said Junyang Securities chief executive Kenny Tang Sing-hing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC was established in 2002 by Ye Jianming, the son of an ordinary worker's family in Fujian province.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After working briefly as an enforcement officer with the forestry department, he earned his first pot of gold helping to extricate a Hong Kong businessman from financial strife and complete a real estate transaction, according to Depth-paper, a Chinese news portal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From there, he bought at auction the oil businesses that the government had confiscated from Xiamen's smuggling kingpin Lai Changxing, using loans from state banks, as well as investors in Hong Kong and Fujian to finance his purchase, he told Fortune in an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By 2015, Ye had built up a business empire with 263 billion yuan (US$39 billion) in revenue, 60 per cent of which was from the trading of oil and gas. CEFC then embarked on an overseas shopping spree, starting with a US$680 million purchase of a majority in the overseas unit of Kazakhstan's state oil company. Subsequent acquisitions extended across eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, mostly in oil and gas.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We can also use it as a springboard to develop business relations with Western Europe."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After Xi Jinping, a self-professed football fan, ascended to China's presidency in 2012, scores of Chinese companies rushed to buy European football teams, star players and coaches, seeking to import foreign talent to improve the moribund Chinese national team.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC wasn't spared from the faze, buying the Czech football club Slavia Praha. Along the way, it bought the five-star Mandarin Oriental hotel in Prague, a 50 per cent stake in the Czech-Slovak financial firm J&amp;T Finance for US$1.1 billion, as well as stakes in the largest Czech airline and the country's largest online travel agency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By last year, Ye was no longer completely under the radar. He was second place on Fortune magazine's "40 Under 40" list of the world's most influential young people, two spots ahead of French president Emmanuel Macron. A 2016 Fortune interview described him as a "mysterious tycoon" and "a rare powerful private player aligned with the Chinese government".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ye is listed as CEFC's founder and chairman, but doesn't appear anywhere on the shareholders list. Instead, the company is split between five shareholders who are all senior executives within the company's corporate structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/11/a477b67e-7cb2-11e7-83c9-6be3df13972a_image_hires_213813.jpg]CEFC's executive directors Li Yong and Zhang Jianjun own a combined 58.1 per cent of CEFC, while independent directors Su Weizhong and Zhuang Miaozhong own 41.1 per cent between them. Zheng Xiongbin, who heads the company's Shanghai asset operations unit, owns the balance 0.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC's Shanghai spokesman declined to say why Ye is not listed as a shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, its shareholding structure didn't hinder CEFC's financing, as the company boasts of what it calls a "full suite" of operating licenses in the financial industry, including securities dealing, trust, futures, banking, insurance, leasing and asset management. It also set up global buyout funds with domestic and major overseas financial institution partners, CEFC said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC had 44.4 billion yuan of credit line as of March 2016, drawing down 83 per cent of that available financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China Development Bank</span><span class="s1">, the country's main policy lender, was CEFC's biggest creditor, extending 32.3 billion yuan of loans, or 87.5 per cent of total bank borrowings, according to the September 2016 bond prospectus of its principal subsidiary CEFC Shanghai International Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC Shanghai recorded 3.1 billion yuan of net profit on 206.6 billion yuan of revenue in 2015, contributing the lion's share of the company's total earnings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With debt at 70 per cent of assets at the end of 2015, CEFC expanded its financing channels including some in Hong Kong to help finance its investment spree.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides pursuing Hong Kong-listed Runway Global as a fund-raising platform, CEFC's main unit obtained a HK$600 million loan facility from Huarong Internatioal Financial in February to fund a US$175 million oil and gas acquisition in Abu Dhabi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The subsidiary also raised HK$900 million last month by issuing preference shares to </span><span class="s3">Huarong International</span><span class="s1">, convertible into common shares if its Hong Kong unit is listed on the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citic CLSA late last year also helped the principal subsidiary raise US$250 million via a bond issuance in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Some mainland enterprises are privately-owned on the surface but are actually agents for the government and state agencies," said Tang. "They are packaged as private firms for making overseas acquisitions that would otherwise be politically more sensitive if conducted by state enterprises."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CEFC's spokesman rejected any suggestion that the company's founder gets any preferential treatment from the Chinese government.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I can responsibly tell you that he has no special background," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/2015/09/04/prop-hk.jpg]Hong Kong home prices could fall by 5 per cent to 10 per cent over the next three years, according to JP Morgan, which warned of the risks of an economic slowdown in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A slowdown marked by falling retail sales and a softening mainland economy would adversely affect home purchasing power and buying desire, saidCusson Leung, head of conglomerates and property research at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung told a press briefing on Friday there were a number of factors that could affect the performance of Hong Kong property market, such as credit leverage and capital flow, while adding that he did not see any immediate risk of over-leveraging of real estate or capital outflow.The unemployment rate is expected to riseCusson Leung, </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, he raised concerns over a potential slowdown of the city's economy, linked to the risk of further decline in the mainland China economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Retail sales are declining and international brands are talking about network consolidation in Hong Kong,” he said. "The unemployment rate is expected to rise.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung said the impact of the negative factors would become more obvious early next year. “2016 will be a more difficult year when compared with 2015. Home prices could see a decline,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While saying that </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1"> had not yet reached a house view on the degree of home price falls, he said it was possible prices could drop by 5 per cent to 10 per cent a year over the next three years, starting from next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong home prices rose 13.5 per cent last year and 8 per cent in the first half of this year, according to the data from the Rating and Valuation Department.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung said home prices were unlikely to see a sharp plunge of 30 per cent in a year unless a crisis or really bad unexpected news hit the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Residential transactions in Hong Kong last month plunged 27.8 per cent month on month to 3,896, according to Land Registry data released on Wednesday, prompting some analysts to predict a modest decline in home prices in the second half of this year. Alva To, senior managing director of real estate services firm DTZ/</span><span class="s3">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span><span class="s1">, predicted home prices could see a decline of 5 per cent to 10 per cent from current levels this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Leung, however, expects prices to remain stable this year, but begin falling next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Centaline Property Agency said its secondary home price index hit a record high of 146.78 yesterday, up 0.91 per cent week on week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decline in property transactions in the past two months was more related to a slowdown in project releases than the wealth effect from the stock market crash, Leung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His comments came a day after </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1"> sold out all 328 flats at phase two of its Century Link development in Tung Chung.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States economy is showing unexpected strength, pushing expectations that the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will soon boost interest rates into high gear. But rising US rates will pose a serious dilemma for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">: should the central bank raise domestic rates and risk a severe credit event in the heavily indebted economy, or hold back on credit-cost increases and face stronger capital outflows?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Friday's US jobs report showed the unemployment rate dropped to 4.6 per cent, the lowest level since 2007. This gives the Fed a stronger case to raise rates 25 basis points at its December 15 to 16 meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the Fed increasingly likely to resume the rate normalisation cycle that started a year ago, the US dollar recently strengthened to 13-year high and yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also soared to the highest in 17 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While the ramifications of the stronger dollar and higher bond yields have not yet affected US economic data, it is already causing problems for emerging markets," analysts for Jefferies said in a note on Monday.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weak local currencies, coupled with higher commodity imports such as oil, would mean many emerging markets' central banks would find themselves tightening "quicker and faster" than the Fed, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However China, already struggling with a growing debt mountain, was caught in the middle; balancing the risk of a credit even against accelerated capital flows, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [Chinese] financial system might not be able to afford higher rates," said Stephen Andrews and Hans Fan, analysts for Deutsche Bank, in another research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consensus expects China's debt levels to continue to rise sharply, possibly reaching about 300 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of 2018 and hitting 320 to 330 per cent by the end of the current five-year plan that spans 2015 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These are eye-wateringly high levels of debt for a developed market, let alone an emerging</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">market, " the Deutsche analysts said.The [Chinese] financial system might not be able to afford higher ratesStephen Andrews and Hans Fan, analysts, Deutsche Bank</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under these circumstance, even if </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> raised domestic rates "very mildly", the impact on debt-servicing costs in the economy would be "material", they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They estimated a mere 10 basis-point increase in the five-year government bond yield each quarter would prompt the debt servicing costs for the economy to start climbing 20 to 25 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This would be a huge drag on growth for an economy that has a credit-driven GDP growth model," they said. "[Therefore] it seems unlikely to us that, in the medium to long-term, the solution to China's debt problem is more debt and higher interest rates."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, on the other side, keeping rates steady or raising rates at a slower pace may also put China in a difficult position.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If US rates rise and Asian rates do not follow, or rise at a slower rate, we think concerns over capital outflows will remain elevated," the Deutsche analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scale of capital flowing across Asia's borders is already unprecedented. China saw approximately US$500 billion leave its financial system over the past 12 months, against inflows of US$300 billion to US$400 billion just two to three years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The shifting interest-rate spread differential between the US dollar bloc and China is only likely to exacerbate China's capital outflow issues," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, mainland Chinese authorities banned UnionPay cardholders on the mainland from buying investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong, a move to try to stem cash outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of last month China stepped up efforts to curb capital flight by introducing measures to restrict domiciled non-financial corporates from transferring or lending yuan offshore, with an upper limit of 30 per cent of shareholder equity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is the first sign that the Chinese authorities have become wary over the pace of [yuan] declines post the poor third-quarter balance of payments, after initially ‘tinkering' with only domestic retail outflows into assets such as Hong Kong insurance products," Jefferies analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the effect of these policies remained to be seen and more could be in the pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> estimated the amount of new liquidity the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had injected into the banking system over the past 12 months could be US$800 to US$900 billion, a huge liquidity injection that is equivalent to 15 to 20 per cent of the total growth in China's commercial bank balance sheets this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This does beg the question that will China have to erect a new ‘Great Wall of China' to try and prevent these capital outflows crossing its borders," the Deutsche analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese financial regulators may relax restrictions on both capital inflow and outflow for foreign funds in a bid to restore the confidence of foreign investors after Beijing's recent capital account tightening fuelled concerns, industry insiders say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> plans to loosen rules governing when foreign investors can bring money in and out of the country in a signal of its commitment to further open financial markets. The rule changes would apply to funds under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, which has granted about US$81 billion in quotas for overseas investment in China's domestic stocks and bonds, Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as saying on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The news came one day after Beijing unleashed a new rule to curb capital outflows. Mainlanders using UnionPay debit and credit cards to purchase insurance products overseas will face caps of US$5,000 per transaction, effective from Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Fang Dongming, head of China equities at </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> and its QFII representative, said it was "very likely" that the Chinese authorities would relax restrictions for QFII capital inflows and outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The relevant QFII regulators in China have been working to loosen control on this field, to make China's equity markets more accessible," he said. "It is still one of the top priorities to internationalise China's capital markets, and the regulators have been pushing for A share's inclusion in reputable global indices, although things have become a little tougher recently with China facing bigger capital outflow pressures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the current rules, a foreign investor with a QFII licence is subject to a monthly quota and window to withdraw their investment or earnings, an industry insider said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regulator has been mulling over the relaxation for more than two years. It originally planned to issue arrangements as early as last April, the source said .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE), the foreign exchange gate keeper, denied media reports it was tightening offshore investments by domestic institutions. Reuters and Caixin reported earlier that several domestic funds had deferred the launch of new products under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many of our foreign investors are deeply concerned about the freedom for investing China, after the recent currency turmoil and China tightens control on capital accounts," a Shanghai-based brokerage analyst with a state-owned brokerage said. "The </span><span class="s3">MSCI</span><span class="s1"> will have another review for A-share inclusion this June, and it means a lot to Beijing."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's moves over the past two days to weaken the yuan have raised speculation that China is embarking on a currency war to boost the country's exports and growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But many disagree, saying the move is part of the government's efforts to allow the yuan to float more freely on the international market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China allowed the yuan to fall nearly 2 per cent against the US dollar on Tuesday and by a further 1.6 per cent on Wednesay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuesday's fall was the sharpest daily devaluation since 1994 and followed weekend data that showed China's exports tumbled 8.3 per cent in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world has long expected the yuan to eventually become a freely floating currency; the highly managed exchange rate is inconsistent with Beijing's other moves towards capital account liberalisation, internationalisation of the yuan, and to have the currency included in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s reserve currency basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tuesday's announcement was a step in that direction, according to Hong Liang, chief economist with </span><span class="s3">China International Capital Corporation</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The move marks a significant step in the reform of the exchange rate system and paves the way for [the yuan] to join the currency basket of </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s Special Drawing Rights," Liang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's growing clout in the global economy means that moves to internationalise the yuan will inevitably have a tremendous impact on trade and global financial markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is now the world's second-largest economy, the largest exporter of manufactured goods and the largest holder of foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And that is why Tuesday's announcement stunned financial markets, sending stocks, currencies and commodities fall sharply across global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> might have called it a "one-off depreciation" but investors were worried that it could all mean the start of a currency war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The [yuan's] volatility has already led to broad currency weakness in Asian currencies against the US dollar and heightened fears of a regional currency war," said Paul Mackel, head of Asian currency research at </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For years, many investments in yuan-denominated assets were built on the assumption that the yuan, as the lynchpin of Beijing's strategy to rebalance its economy away from exports and towards domestic consumption, would move higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those bets have been rewarded as the currency has risen about 30 per cent in nominal terms against the US dollar in the past decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Tuesday was an abrupt change in this course. Economists say central bankers and global investors are worried that the yuan, which has been a regional currency anchor, is succumbing to built-up market depreciation pressures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They also note that the depreciation came after some policymakers in the region loosened financial conditions in response to weak domestic and external demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have sought to boost capital outflows among local investors, with low inflation rates likely giving most central banks room to allow a degree of currency underperformance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mackel said he expected more Asian central banks to explicitly allow currency underperformance, and warned that a "currency war" became communally destructive the moment it escalated to more than just a few countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang Tao, chief China economist with </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1">, said the yuan's depreciation could lead to further weakening of other emerging Asian currencies, which have already been pushed down by their weak growth and policy expectations from the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the yuan move was very modest and belated, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some economists say China could probably benefit from a weaker yuan as its economy is growing at the slowest pace in 25 years and rival exporters Japan and South Korea have weak currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan is near record highs in real effective terms - versus the currencies of trading partners and adjusted for inflation - having risen steadily since its fixed peg was loosened in July 2005.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, others say Beijing's move is less about exports and more about further de-pegging the yuan from the greenback, a shift that would also have global implications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If de-pegged, the US dollar's role as a safe haven will slowly be eroded," said Hong Hao, chief economist and managing director of research at Bocom International. "This is the true significance of the central bank's decision."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jianguang Shen, chief China economist with </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Securities</span><span class="s1">, agreed that the yuan's new fixing rate regime was not a depreciation move in search of export gains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shen said he expected the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> to defend the yuan to prevent capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In view of both the domestic and international economic and financial conditions, there is no basis for persistent depreciation of the yuan," Shen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wang said the central government was unlikely to let market momentum alone drive the yuan's exchange rate because of the destabilising impact.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said Beijing might still want to take a relatively cautious approach on the exchange rate front, a view reflected by most analysts who maintain that a "currency war" can only lead to "currency suicide".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are also wider strategic and geopolitical considerations in play.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A full-on depreciation would trigger an outcry in the </span><span class="s3">US Congress</span><span class="s1"> as the presidential election season heats up and President Xi Jinping prepares to travel to the United States.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States economy is showing unexpected strength, pushing expectations that the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will soon boost interest rates into high gear. But rising US rates will pose a serious dilemma for the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">: should the central bank raise domestic rates and risk a severe credit event in the heavily indebted economy, or hold back on credit-cost increases and face stronger capital outflows?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Friday's US jobs report showed the unemployment rate dropped to 4.6 per cent, the lowest level since 2007. This gives the Fed a stronger case to raise rates 25 basis points at its December 15 to 16 meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the Fed increasingly likely to resume the rate normalisation cycle that started a year ago, the US dollar recently strengthened to 13-year high and yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also soared to the highest in 17 months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“While the ramifications of the stronger dollar and higher bond yields have not yet affected US economic data, it is already causing problems for emerging markets,” analysts for Jefferies said in a note on Monday.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weak local currencies, coupled with higher commodity imports such as oil, would mean many emerging markets' central banks would find themselves tightening “quicker and faster” than the Fed, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However China, already struggling with a growing debt mountain, was caught in the middle; balancing the risk of a credit even against accelerated capital flows, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The [Chinese] financial system might not be able to afford higher rates,” said Stephen Andrews and Hans Fan, analysts for Deutsche Bank, in another research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consensus expects China's debt levels to continue to rise sharply, possibly reaching about 300 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of 2018 and hitting 320 to 330 per cent by the end of the current five-year plan that spans 2015 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These are eye-wateringly high levels of debt for a developed market, let alone an emerging</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">market, ” the Deutsche analysts said.The [Chinese] financial system might not be able to afford higher ratesStephen Andrews and Hans Fan, analysts, Deutsche Bank</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under these circumstance, even if </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> raised domestic rates “very mildly”, the impact on debt-servicing costs in the economy would be “material”, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They estimated a mere 10 basis-point increase in the five-year government bond yield each quarter would prompt the debt servicing costs for the economy to start climbing 20 to 25 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This would be a huge drag on growth for an economy that has a credit-driven GDP growth model,” they said. “[Therefore] it seems unlikely to us that, in the medium to long-term, the solution to China's debt problem is more debt and higher interest rates.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, on the other side, keeping rates steady or raising rates at a slower pace may also put China in a difficult position.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If US rates rise and Asian rates do not follow, or rise at a slower rate, we think concerns over capital outflows will remain elevated,” the Deutsche analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scale of capital flowing across Asia's borders is already unprecedented. China saw approximately US$500 billion leave its financial system over the past 12 months, against inflows of US$300 billion to US$400 billion just two to three years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The shifting interest-rate spread differential between the US dollar bloc and China is only likely to exacerbate China's capital outflow issues,” they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In October, mainland Chinese authorities banned UnionPay cardholders on the mainland from buying investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong, a move to try to stem cash outflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of last month China stepped up efforts to curb capital flight by introducing measures to restrict domiciled non-financial corporates from transferring or lending yuan offshore, with an upper limit of 30 per cent of shareholder equity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is the first sign that the Chinese authorities have become wary over the pace of [yuan] declines post the poor third-quarter balance of payments, after initially ‘tinkering' with only domestic retail outflows into assets such as Hong Kong insurance products,” Jefferies analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the effect of these policies remained to be seen and more could be in the pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> estimated the amount of new liquidity the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> had injected into the banking system over the past 12 months could be US$800 to US$900 billion, a huge liquidity injection that is equivalent to 15 to 20 per cent of the total growth in China's commercial bank balance sheets this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This does beg the question that will China have to erect a new ‘Great Wall of China' to try and prevent these capital outflows crossing its borders,” the Deutsche analysts said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fundraising in Hong Kong hit the lowest level in a decade in the first quarter of this year as poor stock market performance hit companies' plans to list or issue new shares, but the city still remains the largest initial public offering (IPO) market worldwide, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Brokers believe the worst is over, with a stock rebound likely in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It was a really bad first quarter as the stock markets have been volatile from the beginning of the year while the yuan has devaluated against the US dollar. This has discouraged companies to list or make share placements, and investors have also lost appetite for dim sum bonds," said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker of the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Falling yuan and worries over China's slowdown pulled down the Hang Seng Index 10 per cent in January, followed by a drop of another 3 per cent in February, before bouncing back 6 per cent in the first three weeks of March. The benchmark index has thus wiped off all its gains last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong races past New York to return as top IPO market for first time in four years</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total funds raised in the city's stock market in the first quarter stood at US$6.61 billion, down 45.9 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data. This is the worst performance since the first quarter of 2006, when just US$3.5 billion was raised in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among those that tapped the market, 14 companies raised US$3.48 billion in the first quarter through IPO, down 48.5 per cent from the first quarter of last year when 26 IPOs raised US$6.75 billion. This is the worst first-quarter IPO performance since 2013, which saw US$1.10 billion being raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Many of the IPOs this year came from only small players. The big ones preferred to wait for the market to stabilise so that they can price their shares higher," Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Funds raised by existing companies in the first quarter through share placement, rights issues and other means stood at US$2.03 billion, down 62.8 per cent from the same period last year, making it the worst first quarter since 2006 when US$1.67 billion was raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange, however, remains the top IPO market worldwide in the first quarter, the </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data shown. The local bourse was the largest IPO market worldwide last year as well, as it was from 2009 to 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why China will avoid a big, destabilising yuan devaluation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) ranked top worldwide in the first quarter at US$3.48 billion, followed by the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> at US$2.04 billion and the </span><span class="s3">Tokyo Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> at US$900.4 million. Shanghai ranked fourth at US$600.3 million while Shenzhen Small &amp; Medium Enterprise market came in at seventh with US$480.9 million and Shenzhen's technology start-up board ChiNext at eighth with US$310.8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Hong Kong market is not doing good but it appears other markets are not doing any better," said Jasper Lo Cho-yan, chief executive of King International Financial</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Global market sentiment has been dented by the US interest rate rise in December that ended the zero rate era and led to fears of more rate rises and capital outflow from emerging markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides the stock market, yuan-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong also hit record low levels since their launch in 2011 as a result of yuan devaluation, which has affected investor appetite.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There were only 25 dim sum bond issues in the first quarter of this year, raising US$1.095 billion, down 90 per cent from a year ago when 181 issuers raised US$10.85 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lo said the yuan, which lost 5.6 per cent against the US dollar last year and 2 per cent in the first week of this year, has driven away investors. He is, however, upbeat on the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dim Sum bonds brace for impact as Beijing opens onshore bond market to global investors</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The stock market has stabilised of late while the yuan has also bounced back in February. The </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> in mid-March said it would only increase interest rates two times this year instead of the four it had planned earlier. These factors would encourage more IPO and dim sum bonds issues," Lo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first quarter, Zheshang Bank launched the largest IPO is China, raising US$1.69 billion, followed by Bank of Tianjin, which raised US$948.59 million. Both stocks will start trading on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese companies remain the major sources of IPOs in Hong Kong, accounting for 92.4 per cent of the funds raised in the city, with the rest coming from local companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Haitong Securities</span><span class="s1"> led the first quarter in underwriting in Hong Kong, with a market share of 15 per cent and US$1 billion in related proceeds, followed by </span><span class="s3">GF Securities</span><span class="s1"> with a market share at 9.3 per cent, and China International Capital with 6.8 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> continued to keep a tight leash on the country's outbound investment schemes by not releasing any fresh quota as it continued to take more steps to stem capital outflows after foreign exchange reserves dropped to a new low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Contrary to expectations the SAFE decided not relax the threshold for the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors scheme, which allows mainland institutions such as mutual funds to raise capital from local investors in yuan before converting them into foreign currencies for purchasing overseas equities and bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The outstanding investment quota under the QDII scheme stood at US$89.99 billion by the end of February, according to data published on the SAFE website on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The quota for QFII, or Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, which allows foreign funds to trade mainland equities and bonds, on the other hand was expanded to US$1.9 billion in February from US$89.2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The quota for RQFII, which allows foreign funds to undertake equities and bond trading with yuan, was increased by 11.5 billion yuan to 541.1 billion yuan (US$787.5 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The appetite for overseas assets, particularly those linked to the US markets against the backdrop of an interest rate hike, is quite strong, said Yim Fung, chairman of Guotai Junan International, a Hong Kong based brokerage and asset manager. Yim made the comments during a recent interview with the South China Morning Post[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2073084/chinese-investors-offshore-appetite-still-huge-despite-curbs].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's moves also partly seem to be to shore up the renminbi, which dropped nearly 6.6 per cent against the US dollar in 2016, making the worst dip since 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves, a proxy indicator of the fund outflows, dropped to US$2.998 trillion in January, after seven consecutive monthly declines since July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SAFE said capital outflow pressures “have remarkably alleviated since early this year”, as cross-border inflows and outflows are “becoming more balanced”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bets on the yuan have turned slightly bearish, but the positioning is still close to neutral, a recent Reuters poll of 16 market participants showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reflecting the bearish views on the currency in global markets, the offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts, a forward-looking proxy traded at 7.095, 3.01 per cent weaker than the midpoint.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday, the onshore yuan in Shanghai ended 4 points stronger to 6.8714 against the US dollar in evening trade.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investments in the US plummeted 92 per cent in the first nine months of 2018 from its peak two years ago, as the escalating trade war and Washington's intensifying scrutiny of tech investments significantly dampened deal making activity, according to data from Mergermarket on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese M&amp;A in the US reached US$2.67 billion for the first three quarters of this year compared to the all-time high of US$34.4 billion in the same period of 2016. It also reflected a year-on-year drop of 55 per cent from US$5.9 billion achieved in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's economy is slowing, its currency weakening, and the trade regime is faltering,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at Shanghai-based Kaiyuan Capital, explaining the reasons for the decline in Chinese investments. “This doesn't indicate a broad foundation for aggressive international expansion. Beijing has also made it difficult to finance offshore deals.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The funding channels formerly used by giants such as HNA or Anbang are no longer viable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the US has also adopted a policy of tougher regulatory measures for Chinese acquisitions, while Beijing seems to be encouraging top conglomerates to focus more on domestic investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/10/03/c68d9884-c6f6-11e8-9907-be608544c5a1_image_hires_202751.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Given these factors, it's not surprising that Chinese deal makers are putting less capital to work in the US, and this probably won't change until we see an agreement on trade.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This year has already seen several high-profile Chinese acquisition deals collapse because of the heightened US scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US$1.2 billion acquisition of US money transfer firm MoneyGram by </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, an online payment affiliate of </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, fell apart in January after a </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> panel rejected it over national security concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was followed by Sino IC Capital's failed merger with semiconductor maker Xcerra, and </span><span class="s3">HNA Group</span><span class="s1">'s unsuccessful bid to buy former White House aide Anthony Scaramucci's </span><span class="s3">SkyBridge Capital</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With Trump's controversial trade policies and Chinese government's capital outflow curb continuing to cast a shadow on the relationship between the two powerhouses, Chinese dealmakers' interest in the US continued to fall,” said Melissa Yan, research analyst at Mergermarket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasmine Wu, research editor for Asia at the data provider, added that China's inbound M&amp;As have also been affected, as total deal value dropped by more than 20 per cent quarter on quarter in the three months to September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/10/03/c647294e-c6f6-11e8-9907-be608544c5a1_image_hires_202751.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu expected deal making activity may be further affected because of the trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Chinese interest in the US continued to fall, Canada has become a key target for energy assets, data from Mergermarket showed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the first nine months, there were eight Chinese acquisitions in Canada's energy sector worth US$2.2 billion, a six fold increase from the US$390 million in the first three quarters of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The escalating US-China trade war is also taking a toll on global M&amp;A activity, as the total deal value plunged to the lowest third-quarter level in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About US$703 billion worth of deals were concluded in the July to September period, the lowest figure for any single third quarter since 2013. It was down 35 per cent from the second quarter's US$1.09 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During the third quarter, the number of big deals dropped significantly. Only four deals worth more than US$10 billion took place over the past three months, after 28 such deals were reached in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The third quarter saw subdued M&amp;A activity as growing geopolitical tensions, trade wars and protectionism all dampened spirits and caused corporates to pause over the summer,” said Jonathan Klonowski, an analyst for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Mergermarket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tariffs introduced by the US and China crept further into deal making considerations, and advisers had to contend with much harsher conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By region, M&amp;A in Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, experienced a significant downturn. Deal value decreased 26 per cent quarter on quarter to US$164.6 billion over the past three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, the US still saw a very active M&amp;A market in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both deal value and count reached the second-highest on record, with US$1.1 trillion and 4,100 transactions tallied.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This was mainly because of several high-profile deals, including </span><span class="s3">Broadcom</span><span class="s1">'s US$18 billion acquisition of B2B software firm </span><span class="s3">CA Technologies</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Brookfield Asset Management</span><span class="s1">'s US$9.5 billion purchase of </span><span class="s3">Forest City Realty Trust</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Renesas Electronics</span><span class="s1">' takeover of </span><span class="s3">Integrated Device Technology</span><span class="s1"> for US$7 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said with macro concerns escalating, companies around the globe have been considering more domestic consolidation than cross-border deals, as the former receives much lower levels of scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Consequently, domestic M&amp;As surged to a record high for the first nine months of 2018, reaching US$1.67 trillion in value, up 31 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cross-border deals, meanwhile, saw their share of global M&amp;As shrink to 38.6 per cent, 4 percentage points lower than the same period last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If US President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his campaign promise to impose punitive tariffs on Asian imports, analysts say the implications could be enormous for China and Asia, with some heavily export-dependent economies at the risk of plunging into contraction as soon as next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At this stage, the greatest uncertainty surrounds Trump's impact on China, as commentators try to figure out whether his plans for crippling import duties on goods from the country were real, or just bombastic election campaign rhetoric.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The risk is clearly there," said Larry Hu, an economist with Macquarie Research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If protectionism does escalate globally, China might retaliate by allowing for bigger RMB depreciation," he said. "It would be a trade war and hurt everyone."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is already suffering from stubbornly weak exports. October's total dropped 7.3 per cent on-year in US dollar terms, marking a seventh straight month of declines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US exports accounted for about 17 per cent of China's total merchandise exports 2011 to 2015, according to statistics from CEIC (China Economic &amp; Industry Data).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If a partial trade war breaks out, such as in the electronics segment, it will add to China's economic woes next year, not only making the export slump even worse, but also resulting in large-scale job losses in the manufacturing sector," Guotai Junan analysts wrote in a recent research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government may also be forced to loosen its monetary policy again as a buffer against external shocks, which would materially increase risks in the financial system, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflow pressures could also increase as a result of Trump's tax reduction policies on US firms, they added.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts from the Washington DC-based </span><span class="s3">Peterson Institute for International Economics</span><span class="s1"> has also raised the issue of potential impact on Asia of uncertainty, but it said that imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports may effectively shut down some of the country's most-important export segments, in particular from the global supply chains industries, including computers, cars, and consumer electronics.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In retaliation, said Peterson Institute, China might impose a "asymmetric" trade war, which could include barring state-owned enterprises (SOEs) from doing business with US firms, denying key components to supply chains, terminating the purchase of US business services by SOEs, such as electronic payment services and financial information services, ending the purchase of </span><span class="s3">US government</span><span class="s1"> bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to its estimates, a full trade war could also send the US into a recession, with the economy possibly registering a negative growth of 0.1 per cent by 2019, while the unemployment rate might spike to 8.4 per cent in the same year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not only the US and China will be affected, but other economies in Asia could feel enormous pressure as a result of any trade protectionism, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US market turns out to be more significant to the Asian region's exports if we take into account indirect linkages, such as intermediate exports that pass through one country (or more) before finally making their way to the US, " said Taimur Baig and Diana Del-Rosario, analysts for </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1">, in a separate research report.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking into account direct and indirect linkages, Asia's export exposure to the US ranges from 11 to 21 per cent, according to data from the </span><span class="s3">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">OECD</span><span class="s1">).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"An environment of trade protectionism would put the heavily export-dependent economies in the region (Asia) at risk," they said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Except for China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, the rest of the economies in Asia derive at least 40 per cent of their respective GDPs from exports. Hong Kong and Singapore lead the pack with exports worth over 130 per cent of GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> predictions, a 30 per cent drop in export earnings from the US, holding all other factors unchanged, would materially weaken most Asian economies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and Singapore would run the risk of a sharp economic contraction next year, as annual growth could be pared down by at least 6 percentage points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea could experience a 2 to 3 percentage-point growth reduction in their respective economies next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Malaysia's growth could be halved to around 2 per cent, while the Philippines could slow down to sub-5 per cent growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As for India and Indonesia, they stand "relatively resilient" to US protectionist measures, </span><span class="s3">Deutsche Bank</span><span class="s1"> analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, India's vulnerability to services exports is still considerable, given that 60 per cent of its service exports go the US, they added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Did </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> follow in the footsteps of its US counterpart to raise interest rates? It has strangely become an issue of debate for China's monetary policy watchers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The facts on Thursday were pretty clear. A few hours after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised the overnight fund rate by 0.25 percentage points, interest rates in China's money market, or the borrowing costs charged by the central bank to commercial lenders, edged up 10 basis points for a number of transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> published an unusual statement on its website explaining that the higher rates in the interbank market were a market response to the Fed's move rather than a deliberate policy reaction and it didn't mean any “interest rate increases” in China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The criteria for whether China is raising interest rates are the benchmark loan and deposit rates, the central bank said. The interest rate changes in money market deals between the central bank and commercial lenders were decided “mainly by the market” and “shouldn't be read into too much”, according to the central bank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China raises money market rates to stabilise yuan and outflow, after Fed's move[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2079352/china-raises-money-market-rates-second-time-year-pumps-new]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the higher borrowing costs in China still attracted a lot of attention. After all, rates in reverse repurchase agreements and the medium-term lending facility, the monetary policy tools in adjusting liquidity, are influenced heavily, if not solely decided, by </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1">. At least, the central bank was tolerating money market rates to move higher on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a broader context, the central bank itself has been playing down the “benchmark role” of deposit and lending rates as it has liberalised the rates banks can charge to their clients.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As early as 2014, central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China was in the process of finding its own “policy rates” in the money markets as the traditional benchmarks, namely one-year deposit and loan rates, were gradually losing relevance and frequency in monetary policy operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The last time China adjusted the deposit and lending rates was 17 months ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By contrast, money market rates offer a more frequent and consistent measure to judge China's monetary policy stance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An edge-up of 10 basis points, or 0.01 percentage points, may look small and trivial, but it was the second increase this year and it is a signal pointing to further rises down the road, particularly if the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> keeps raising rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fed raises US rates and signals more to come, as Yellen cites an improving economy[http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2079232/fed-raises-us-rates-expected-more-increases-loom]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That is why the market is taking this seriously. So, why is </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> denying any interest rate increases when the money market rates are moving upwards?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It reflects the delicate balance the central bank is trying to achieve under its “prudent and neutral” monetary policy stance and its dilemma over what course to chart as the US is ending its post financial crisis stimulus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While China is putting on a brave face about capital outflows and the depletion of its foreign exchange reserves, it is quietly strengthening controls over outbound remittance and investments. China's outbound investment, even measured by yuan, has plunged 53 per cent in the first two months of 2017 from a year ago, </span><span class="s3">China's ministry of commerce</span><span class="s1"> said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So when the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is raising interest rates, </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> cannot afford to sit idle because that may bring additional risks of capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> also cannot afford a serious monetary tightening either because a quick rise in borrowing costs may lead to widespread debt defaults or even kill a nascent economic recovery at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Federal Reserve's rate rise is the start of a return to normality[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2079707/federal-reserves-rate-rise-start-return-normality]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Therefore, </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> must tolerate modest rises in money market rates while avoid sending any broad tightening signals to hurt the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For those who agree with </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> that only a hike in benchmark lending or deposit rates can be called “an interest rate increase”, then it's true that China is not following the US and it may keep its “benchmark” rates unchanged throughout this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, for those who believe higher money market rates can be seen as authentic interest rate rises, especially rates decided in deals where the central bank is the key trading counterpart, then China is following the suit of the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> and there will be many more “mini-hikes” to come.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's benchmark index dropped for the fourth day in a row to a 11-month low, weighed down by heavyweight </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> and currency woes. Chinese stocks too extended losses on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall came as offshore yuan hit a 20-month low and the Hong Kong dollar weakened to the low end of the peg, which forced the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> to intervene in the foreign exchange market on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,323.59, down 429.34 points or 1.6 per cent. The losing streak that started last Friday after the Turkish lira crisis roiled global markets, has dragged the index to its lowest level since last September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In China, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 57 points, or 2 per cent, to end at 2,723.26, while the Shenzhen Composite Index fell 2.1 per cent, or 32.08 points, to 1,481.82.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The blue-chip CSI 300 index fell 2.4 per cent, or 80.94 points, to end at 3,291.98.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the Hong Kong dollar and yuan have weakened against the US dollar in recent days, investors sold yuan assets and Hong Kong listed companies to escape the currency devaluation loss, leading to capital outflow. This is bad news for the stock markets,” said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, managing director at VC Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said HKMA's buying of the Hong Kong dollar meant that Hong Kong's aggregate balance, which is an indicator of liquidity in the banking industry, has dropped to HK$104.9 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When it drops below the HK$100 billion threshold, it may signal an increase in interest rates in Hong Kong. If it happens, it would hurt the stock market and property market sentiment,” said Tse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent fell 3.6 per cent, for a fourth straight day, to HK$336 ahead of the company's results announcement. Market observers were pessimistic about the Chinese internet giant's earnings from mobile games in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent, which announced results after the market close, reported a decline of 19 per cent to 17.6 billion yuan from the prior quarter in its mobile-game business, as it failed to get approval to charge fees for popular tactical tournament games and new game releases were delayed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Net income fell to 17.9 billion yuan (US$2.6 billion) in the quarter ended June 30, compared with 19.3 billion yuan average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other heavyweights such as </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, AIA and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> also fell more than 1 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's yuan currency continued to weaken on Wednesday morning and broke a market threshold of 6.59 to the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speculative trading has risen because of tepid economic data and concerns over an interest rate hike in the US, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan in Shanghai at one point weakened 0.19 per cent, or 125 basis points, to 6.5908 against the US dollar, the lowest level since mid-January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the offshore yuan also tumbled, falling 89 basis, or 0.14 per cent, from the day before, to hit the lowest point in nearly four months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China (PBOC)</span><span class="s1">, the country's central bank, on Wednesday set the yuan reference point against the US dollar at 6.5889, 99 basis points, or 0.15 per cent, weaker compared with Tuesday as the yuan continued to depreciate against the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to deal up to 2 per cent either side of the reference point for the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Speculation is accelerating on the ongoing weakness in [China's] Purchasing Managers' Index" Stephen Innes, senior trader at </span><span class="s3">OANDA</span><span class="s1">, said. "I think much of the pace will be dictated by Friday's non-farm Payroll number [from the US] as this will likely dictate whether a near-term rate hike is on the cards or not."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's official manufacturing PMI for May came in at 50.1, the same as a month earlier. The non-official Caixin manufacturing PMI for May was 49.2, the lowest in three months and has been below 50 for 15 months. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alan Luk Ting-lung, </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1">'s head of private banking, said the depreciation of the yuan has been more obvious since the middle of May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a continuing capital outflow from the mainland to Hong Kong as Chinese bought US dollar denominated insurance products or Hong Kong dollar denominated equities to hedge the yuan's depreciation risk, but there is no sign of a sharp devaluation of the currency, Luk said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The offshore yuan normally falls quicker than the onshore one to reflect investors' expectations of a downside trend to the currency, because the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> does not intervene in the offshore market , but recently it is the onshore yuan which had dropped more," Luk said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A more market-driven foreign exchange policy has increased the daily volatility of the onshore yuan, and the rising concern of a US rate hike has also added pressure, but that does not change the fact that the currency is falling in an orderly fashion, Luk said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Luk said he expects the red back to fall 5 per cent this year and reach a level of 6.7 to 6.8 against the greenback.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has introduced two measures to enhance local banks' yuan liquidity in its latest effort to fend off increased international competition for a slice of the offshore yuan business pie.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SCMP, July 26</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Somehow I get the feeling that we are not told the entire story here and that what we really see happening is an HKMA, now the world's chief yuan cheerleader, making a valiant effort to inspire a tiring currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We start with the evidence of the first chart. It shows a huge reversal of China's capital flows last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From a net inflow of US$252 billion in 2011, the figures changed to a net outflow of US$97 billion in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[Technical note for those so-minded: I have treated errors and omissions in the balance of payments as capital flows here because that's what they are in practice.]</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We do not yet have any figures for 2013, but the leading indicators in foreign reserve movements, trade performance, and foreign financial offerings all suggest these capital flows remain steeply in negative territory. For instance, there has recently been a notable sell-off in the offshore yuan debt instruments known as dim sum bonds, with yields rising to almost 6 per cent and no new issuance for six weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To counter the trend, Beijing has resorted to showy reforms such as doing away with the lower limit on interest rates for yuan loans, which means nothing when the pressure on interest rates is actually up, not down, and to steadily intervening in the foreign exchange market to support the yuan. Let the yuan crumble and the capital outflow will turn into a flood to rival those photos we have seen recently of water releases from dams on the Yellow River.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Naturally the HKMA was also called on to do its bit and it has thus announced both an overnight and a one-day window of yuan funding for banks. It wants Hong Kong to keep its primacy of place in that torrent of money pouring into China, you see. Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Let's put the Hong Kong offshore yuan market into perspective. The bar on the left of the second chart represents the yuan deposit base of China's financial system, the bar on the right total outstanding deposits of yuan in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, the 700 billion yuan held here is a big number for a small place, particularly as it was only 70 billion yuan three years ago. But it is still a small number for a big place that has a deposit base of 100 trillion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And Hong Kong represents three quarters of the offshore yuan market. This gives you a total offshore yuan market amounting to less than 1 per cent of the onshore market. Anyone really care to play trivial pursuits?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's simple. The financial affairs of China are centred on China, not anywhere abroad, and at the moment they show a greater stage of turbulence than they have experienced for several years or than many people had expected... but could have anticipated. The turbulence is the inevitable outcome of years of centrally directed misallocation of capital.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets closed the morning session down about 2 per cent on Tuesday following the overnight slide in US stocks due to the persisting weakness in oil prices and worries over a hard landing by China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped below the 19,000-level to finish the morning session at 18,992.54, down 347.60 points, or 1.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, or the H-share index, which tracks mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, dropped below the 8,000-level to close the morning at 7,975.16, down 2.42 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurance stocks took the heaviest beating, falling 2.65 per cent on average, followed by banking stocks that fell 2.46 per cent and oil stocks, 2.29 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index dropped below the 2,900-level to close the morning session at 2,877.11, down 2.09 per cent, while large-cap CSI300 was down 1.75 per cent at 3,074.10.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen Composite Index finished the session at 1,797.24, down 2.63 per cent, and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">-style ChiNext dropped 2.80 per cent to 2,098.31.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage, blamed the all-round poor performance on the fresh pressure on oil prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The drop in oil and the US markets last night created strong selling pressure in both Hong Kong and mainland stock markets. It's even worse on the mainland as it appear China wants to add tax on oil products," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, the futures markets' settlement day being Thursday, some investors might wind up their short positions from this afternoon, which may help narrow the loss," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Major US indexes all fell overnight, reversing the rally of the previous two sessions that had helped Wall Street report the first weekly gains this year. Dow Jones Industrial Average Index dropped 1.29 per cent, or 208.29 points, to 15,885.22, while S&amp;P 500 closed 1.56 per cent lower at 1,877.08. </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> fell 1.58 per cent to 4,518.49.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The retreat in stocks tracked a similar trend in oil prices, which fell 6 per cent due to the lingering worries over oversupply after Iraq output reached a record high last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast to stocks and oil, gold rose 0.8 per cent at the New York futures gold markets trade at US$1,105.3 per ounce</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japer Lo Cho-yan, director of Tung Shing Futures, said investors are also looking at the US Fed meet on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While the markets widely expect no more interest rate rise in the near term, investors, however, also worry about what statement the Fed will issue after the meeting, which would give hints about the pace of the interest rate rise process. This has added uncertainty to the stock market," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said the currency speculators who have attacked the Hong Kong dollar may also short-sell Hong Kong stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Under the peg and the currency board, the interest rate would rise amid capital outflow and the stock market would be hurt. This is how the speculators benefit, as they attack the Hong Kong dollar peg to drive the interest rate up, while at the same time short-selling Hang Seng Index futures betting stocks will go down after the interest rate rises," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will intervene in the currency market while </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> may add to the margin on futures contracts to raise the cost for speculators," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong dollar once dropped to 7.80 11 on Tuesday morning before bouncing back to 7.7964 at noon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Japan's Nikkei225 dropped 1.78 per cent, or 304.30 points, to 16,806.61 at the midday while the key Korean index was down 0.91 per cent to 1,876.23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong stocks' American Depository Receipts (ADRs) closed lower in the US market after the Hong Kong market closed on Monday. After conversion into Hong Kong dollar, HSBC ADRs closed at HK$52.187, down 2.64 per cent from Hong Kong Monday close. China Life ADRs closed at HK$18.98, down 1.75 per cent, while China Mobile ADRs closed at HK$82.93, down 0.97 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese yuan fell on Tuesday morning as speculators returned to the market as the two central banks stayed away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong dollar once hit 7.8011 to the US dollar in early trade before slipping to 7.7980, putting an end to the rising streak of the three previous days. Big buying orders, which currency traders believe to have been from the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> (HKMA) to prevent the currency from falling too low, had pushed the currency above 7.80 from the early hours of Thursday. The local currency once hit 7.8294 on Wednesday midnight, its lowest in eight and a half years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Worries over capital outflow, market slump and China's economic slowdown dragged down the Hong Kong dollar 0.01 per cent last week. It is now down 0.55 per in the first three trading weeks of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Offshore yuan was also weaker on Tuesday morning, trading at 6.6118, down 0.07 per cent from Monday. The currency rose 0.07 per cent last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jasper Lo Cho-yan, director of Tung Shing Futures, said speculators sold the Hong Kong dollar and the yuan again after the HKMA and the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">stopped their intervention.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> and the HKMA intervene in the markets, speculators retreat. But now that they see the central banks have stopped their action, they have come back to the market again. This will continue for a while," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s intervened two weeks ago to drive away speculators, offshore yuan overnight interbank funding was pushed up to 200 per cent on January 12. The currency has been generally stable since.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s intervention helped the currency rebound, lifting offshore yuan 0.07 per cent last week, adding to a gain of 1 per cent the previous week. That followed the offshore yuan's fall of 1.72 per cent in the first week of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Onshore yuan remained flat at 6.5793 on Tuesday morning. It rose 0.08 per cent last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The spread between onshore and offshore yuan has now narrowed down to 325 basis points, down from record 1,400 basis points on January 7.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> on Tuesday set the yuan mid-price against the US dollar at 6.5548, 9 basis points stronger than Monday - the third straight day that the central bank has set the mid-price higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it set the yuan mid-price against the euro weaker by 237 basis points at 7.1183 and 62 basis points weaker at 5.5493 for every 100 yen. The mid-price against the pound was set 411 basis points stronger at 9.3355.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent of either side of the mid-price for the day.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a normal world, US Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell would only need to deliver an upbeat assessment of the American economy while cautioning markets to prepare for a gradual rise in interest rates. But, with an erratic US president among his critics, Powell found himself having to defend Fed policy in his first speech to the annual gathering of American central bankers at Jackson Hole since taking up the top post. This is just as well. With the Hong Kong dollar pegged to the greenback, the city is better off with a robustly independent Fed and its consistent but cautious monetary policy than an opportunistic Donald Trump driven by shifting political and even personal considerations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A week ago, Trump said he was “not thrilled” by the Fed's monetary tightening and complained he should have been “given some help by the Fed” instead of having to face two rate rises since Powell became chairman earlier this year. In his latest speech, Powell defended the need to raise rates, having declared that key indicators such as household and business spending, and employment and inflation rates all pointed to robust and sustainable growth without overheating. He reaffirmed a policy of gradual tightening.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His appears to be the consensus view among fellow central bankers. So the blatant attempt by Trump to influence the Fed may be discarded, especially at a time when his political capital is rapidly depleting, thanks to an ongoing scandal over hush money paid to a porn star and a former Playboy playmate. The Fed is not the only primary governing institution declaring independence from political interference. Even Trump's one-time ally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, found it necessary to reassure the American public that the </span><span class="s3">US Justice Department</span><span class="s1"> would not be “improperly influenced”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New US Fed boss starts off from rare position of strength[https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2133689/new-us-fed-boss-starts-rare-position-strength]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Back in Hong Kong, Powell's message should rightly carry much more weight than Trump's. From the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> and some banks to major developers and property agencies, key financial players are preparing for a market slowdown. The HKMA has recently defended the Hong Kong dollar. With the withdrawal of liquidity, mortgage rates are under pressure to rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, investment bank CLSA, as well as banking giants Citibank and </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">, have warned of a sharp property downturn ahead, thanks to a combination of rising interest rates, a slowing mainland economy and a depreciating yuan. How ironic that Trump, too, has been complaining about the drop in value of the yuan since the start of the Sino-US trade war while accusing Beijing of currency manipulation. China is actually more worried about capital outflow than using a low yuan to boost exports. With Hong Kong's housing prices having risen for 27 straight months, a correction is overdue and healthy. Hopefully, it will be a soft landing rather than a crash.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Pak Shek Kok in Tai Po is about 30 minutes by bus from University, the closest MTR station and more than an hour from Central. Hong Kong Science Park, which is about a brisk 10-minute walk, is the most convenient place in the vicinity to dine and shop.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite such inconveniences and remoteness, developers are expected to launch more than 3,000 flats over the next few months in this corner of northeastern Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Homebuyers should take note if Hong Kong's dollar balance dips below HK$100 billion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Agents meanwhile expect a strong response despite abundant supply and the likelihood of higher interest rates spilling over to higher mortgage rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Saturday, </span><span class="s3">K Wah Group</span><span class="s1"> unveiled the sales brochure of its 1,122-unit Solaria development, less than two weeks after the Lands Department gave it the pre-sale approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Flats in the nine-tower development range from a 225 sq ft studio to a four-bedroom unit of 1,083 sq ft. About 70 per cent of the flats are on the smaller side. Sales are expected to commence at the end of May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1"> is expected to launch the first phase of its St Martin development next month. The developer said 55 per cent of the 804 flats will have two bedrooms or less. Phase two will have 640 flats.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Horizon by Billion Development and Project Management will include 667 units that start from 450 sq ft to 1,540 sq ft and eight villas of more than 4,000 sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The details of three other developments in the area by Billion Development, </span><span class="s3">Sino Land</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Great Eagle Holdings</span><span class="s1"> are yet to be revealed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The market response should be strong since most of the flats are small that fit the market's demand, unless they are priced too “ambitiously”, said Tommy Chow, senior sales director at Ricacorp Properties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Launches of small flats have become rare in the New Territories East,” said Chow, adding that other developments near Pak Shek Kok, such as Providence Bay and Mayfair By The Sea, mainly consist of large flats.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Daniel Chiu, principal regional sales director at Centaline Property Agency, echoes the sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There will be heavy demand for these new homes considering the strong sales seen for Mount Regency and Wings at Sea Two,” Chiu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is the race to raise deposit rates the harbinger that could deflate Hong Kong's property bubble?[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2147080/race-raise-deposit-rates-harbinger-could-deflate-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 250 new flats were sold last weekend, of which 94 were at Wing at Sea Two in Lohas Park and 78 at Mount Regency in Tuen Mun, both of which are located away from Hong Kong island.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chiu said K Wah was likely to price units at Solaria slightly higher than the current levels, mainly because it is likely to be the first developer to launch in the area and expects demand to be high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The prices in the area range from HK$13,309 per sq ft at Providence Bay to HK$18,291 at Mayfair By The Sea, according to Centaline Property Agency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Lam, senior director at Knight Frank, also expects demand for new flats in the New Territories will be strong despite the high future supply as new flats are more popular with buyers than older ones under the cooling measures and current market conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The high supply of flats at Pak Shek Kok comes amid the likelihood of higher interest rates in Hong Kong in the coming months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts believe that the Hong Kong dollar, which weakened to its lowest level in 35 years because of capital outflow, is forcing banks to offer higher interest rates on fixed-time deposits to shore up their liquidity levels. As banks' cost of funds rise, they are likely to pass it on to borrowers in the form of higher lending rates, including mortgages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Raymond Cheng, property analyst at CIMB Securities, said that the prime rate, which determines the mortgage rate, has not risen for more than a decade, and is unlikely to increase in the near term because of keen competition in the mortgage market among banks.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's non-financial overseas investment nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 due to tighter capital restrictions and rising global uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Non-financial outbound direct investment fell 45.8 per cent year on year to US$48.19 billion in the first half, </span><span class="s3">China's Ministry of Commerce</span><span class="s1"> said on Thursday. In June alone, outbound investment dropped 11.3 per cent from a year earlier to US$13.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the end of 2016 Beijing introduced tighter controls over funds moving out of the country and increased scrutiny of domestic companies' foreign investments. Last month banking regulators said they were examining bank loans taken out by the country's top deal-making companies including </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1">, Fosun, HNA and </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

He noted that Chinese foreign investment in industries like property, hotels, cinemas and entertainment have dropped 82.5 per cent year on year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, investment in overseas property fell 82.1 per cent year on year in the first half, accounting for just 2 per cent of total outbound investment during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, data from merger and acquisition deals also confirmed the downward trend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to consulting firm Mergermarket, deals by Chinese companies in the hotel, property and entertainment sectors surged 233 per cent year on year in 2016, reaching US$15.86 billion across 33 different transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biggest deals included HNA acquiring a 25 per cent stake in </span><span class="s3">Hilton Worldwide Holdings</span><span class="s1"> for US$6.5 billion and </span><span class="s3">Anbang Insurance</span><span class="s1"> buying </span><span class="s3">Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts</span><span class="s1"> for US$5.5 billion. But starting from January this year, only 14 deals with a combined value of US$1.6 billion have been recorded, the lowest since 2013.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China's stable and improved economic growth in the first six months helped strengthen domestic investors' confidence so that more capital stayed in the country,” Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moreover, regional conflicts, more acts of terrorism and tighter regulations on foreign capital in some countries and regions have increased global uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Those factors actually hindered China's investment in overseas markets,” Gao said, without naming specific countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mergermarket's global M&amp;A report shows 27 fewer Chinese deals with Europe in the first half of 2017, with deal value dropping 65.7 per cent to US$25.6 billion across 59 transactions. That compares with the record of US$74.8 billion across 86 deals seen in the first half of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Geopolitical concerns over Brexit and terrorism attacks have discouraged foreign capital inflow to Europe.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> lowered the daily yuan reference rate to its weakest level in over three weeks on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump announced overnight that the US will impose a graduated tariff hike, starting with 10 per cent on about US$200 billion worth of Chinese imports before moving to 25 per cent at the start of 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US tariffs had already been well telegraphed to markets in the past week. The implementation of graduated hikes and the revised tariff list which excludes some consumer goods is milder than expected, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A 10 per cent tariff will apply from September 24, eventually rising to 25 per cent on January 1, in phased approached which will contain the rise of US inflation, and help some Chinese exporters, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's response is a big unknown because it cannot go tit-for-tat as they do not consume enough US goods, said Stephen Innes head of trading APAC at currency broker Oanda.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any heavy-handed approach such as flat-out import restrictions could bring the big market “bears out of hibernation”, Innes added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">lowered the daily reference rate at 6.8554 per dollar, reflecting its weakest level in over three weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders are allowed to trade up to 2 per cent on either side of the reference point. Onshore yuan traded on the mainland fell 0.28 per cent to 6.8765 per US dollar, approaching the psychologically important 6.9000 level. Offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong fell to its weakest in over three weeks, becoming the worst performer among 11 most traded Asian currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan will continue to face downward pressure this week. But markets are watching to see if the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> will defend the 6.9 level, the same level it took action last time,” said Jimmy Zhu, chief strategist at Fullerton Markets. “China does not want a sharp fall in the yuan because that is very costly as it would trigger capital outflow fears and contagion to the capital markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this month Trump had warned that he had further tariffs set for US$267 billion worth of Chinese goods, beyond the latest US$200 billion, which would engulf all remaining US imports from China, including Apple's iPhone and competing smartphone makers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Iris Pang, Greater China economist at </span><span class="s3">ING Bank</span><span class="s1"> said China was unlikely to return to the negotiation table before the end of US midterm elections.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The booming real estate market will continue to provide stimulus in China, removing pressure for mainland trade officials to engage in trade talks with their American counterparts at this time, Pang said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign reserves in November fell to the lowest level since February 2013 on what some experts called the mainland's biggest capital outflow on record.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves held by the central bank fell to US$3.44 trillion at the end of last month, down US$87.2 billion, according to data released on Monday by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expectations that the yuan will continue to devalue has led to strong demand for US dollar, forcing the central bank to intervene in the market to prop up the value of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strengthening of the dollar during November caused a revaluation of the assets China holds. About 30 per cent of China's reserves are denominated in currencies other than the dollar and led to at least part of the drop, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“That would count for about half of the outflow but not all of it,” said Hong Hao, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong. “This is still a very significant outflow. It shows strong demand from China's private sector to buy dollars.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Factoring in the decrease in value of other currencies, </span><span class="s3">Capital Economics</span><span class="s1"> estimates that the central bank sold around US$57 billion in November. If China's goods and services surplus hit the projected US$55 billion last month, the London-based research house said that would imply net capital outflows of US$113 billion, compared to US$37 billion in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The pick-up in capital outflows appears to have been predominately driven by increased expectations for renminbi depreciation,” Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note. “A rise in offshore interest rates due to the increased likelihood of a December Fed rate hike will also have added to outflow pressures.”?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by US$405 billion this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> said late last month that it would add the yuan to its basket of global currencies, called Special Drawing Rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against an expected rate hike in the US in December and gradually higher global interest rates, many experts expect capital outflows from China to continue. The inclusion in the SDR basket next year, which could lead to demand for yuan from central banks in other countries, could temper the devaluation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We do not expect any large-scale devaluation given that RMB has just made it into the SDR basket,” Junheng Li, head of research at JL Warren Capital, said in a note to investors. “Additionally, China will chair the G-20 for 2016, so the leadership in Beijing will not want any embarrassing public controversy about competitive depreciation, etc.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Over the past week, the yuan has fallen slightly against the dollar from 6.39 to 6.40. Nomura expects the yuan to fall to between 6.75-6.80 by the end of next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan dropped for a ninth day on Tuesday, extending its longest losing streak in four years, because of expectations that the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">was shifting to a policy allowing the Chinese currency to depreciate amid an escalation of China-US trade tensions.[The yuan's] weakness has accelerated since concerns intensified the US and China could embrace a trade warJameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research, FXTM</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, the offshore yuan traded at 6.5911 per US dollar, down 0.6 per cent from Monday, marking its biggest daily drop since February 8. It is now trading at its lowest level since December 21, 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against a basket of currencies, however, the yuan was trading near a two-year high of 97.88 hit in May, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System RMB index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Resilience in the yuan relative to a sell-off in other currencies, such as the euro, this year reflects the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s efforts towards stabilising the currency to attract foreign investors to buy mainland stocks and bonds, thus internationalising the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the recent accelerated decline in the yuan, which has dropped 3 per cent in the past two weeks, against the dollar points to a change in the central bank's policy of tolerating a depreciating yuan, analysts have said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This has quickly transformed the yuan from being one of the best performing emerging market currencies across the globe to now trading more than 0.7 per cent lower year to date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is likely to allow the yuan to depreciate to offset potential slowing exports from the escalating trade conflict,” said Jimmy Zhu, chief strategist at Shanghai-based Fullerton Markets. Zhu forecast the yuan to drop to 6.61 against the US dollar by the end of the third quarter, while the Chinese currency was most likely to have peaked against the basket of currencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Media reports said the Trump Administration was planning to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies, in sectors ranging from aerospace to robotics, which suggests it was scaling up measures to contain the rise of China in manufacturing capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response, the yuan and China equities extended their declines and set fresh year-to-date lows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at UK foreign exchange trading company FXTM, said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> was possibly allowing the yuan to play catch up to the losses most global currencies and emerging market counterparts have faced, given the fact there has been a broad-based US dollar rally across foreign exchange markets over the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan is suffering in line and in similar form to its emerging market counterparts, but the speed in weakness has accelerated since concerns intensified the United States and China could embrace a trade war,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ken Cheung Kin Tai, senior Asian foreign exchange strategist at </span><span class="s3">Mizuho Bank</span><span class="s1">, said the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> would most likely allow for further yuan depreciation to support growth, but only as long as capital outflow pressures stayed under control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan started to fall on June 14, after the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> decided not to follow US interest rate increases on the day, and following an escalation in the US and China trade dispute.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The abrupt suspension of a 12-year-old immigration investor scheme sent ripples through the financial and immigration industries yesterday as would-be investors rushed to catch the "last train" in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Set up in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme has attracted thousands of mainlanders to quickly and cheaply procure residency in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eligible applicants have to invest at least HK$10 million in stocks, bonds or insurance in the city and have prior residency anywhere apart from four rogue states and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Post reported in 2013 that Gambia - where many Chinese citizens have gained permanent residency - was the No1 source of applications under the scheme, followed by Guinea-Bissau, Canada and the Philippines.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As of September, HK$205.8 billion has been invested with the scheme, about a fifth of it in real estate, which ceased being an investment class in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Roughly 90 per cent of all approved cases were "Chinese nationals with permanent residence overseas".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">EK Immigration Consulting chairman Eddie Kwan King-hung expressed shock at the move, announced in Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's policy address, saying it would deal a huge blow to the immigration and financial industries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He estimated there were hundreds of applicants rushing to get applications processed at agencies across Hong Kong and the mainland. His own firm received almost 200 submissions yesterday - equivalent to what it handles in an average month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, consultancies are fighting a war," he said. "Some small and medium-sized firms may face lay-offs."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As an alternative to suspending the scheme, Kwan said the government should instead raise the investment quota or place a cap on application approvals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Immigration Department spokesman said the move was made in an attempt to attract more professionals and "innovative entrepreneurs".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In view of the latest economic situation in Hong Kong, attracting capital investment entrants should no longer be our priority," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Applications received by the department before the suspension date, whether already approved or still being processed, will not be affected, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of brokerage firms offering capital investment entrant scheme services said the move would hurt their business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The suspension is going to cut down an income source for brokers," said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tse suspected the move may have been related to Beijing's anti-graft policy and "crackdown on capital outflow by those who take money out of the country in the name of migration".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jojo Choy, vice-chairman of National Resources Securities, saw the move as an attempt to cool the property market. But she said it would also have a political effect, by easing anti-mainland sentiment in Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record fall in mainland China's foreign currency reserves last month validated earlier market observations that the central bank had been defending the yuan from falling further.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the intervention cannot continue at such a dramatic pace if the world's second-largest economy remains committed to moving towards an open currency regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reserves declined US$93.9 billion, or 2.6 per cent, to US$3.56 trillion from July, the biggest monthly fall on record, according to data released on Monday by the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The keenly anticipated figures, slightly short of market estimates of a decline of between US$100 billion and US$200 billion, heightened confusion over the direction of China's foreign exchange policy and the effectiveness of continual monetary easing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The pickup in outflows and the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1">'s response raises questions about the outlook for the currency and monetary policy," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics. "We suspect that the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> is hoping to stem the strong speculative downward pressure that its currency reform created but that, if it succeeds, it will scale back support and allow the [yuan] to weaken gradually."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He estimated the actual fall would be US$110 billion after netting out book gains from the strengthening yen and euro in the past month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> does not disclose the composition of the basket of foreign currencies it holds. As part of its efforts to gain inclusion in the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1">'s special drawing rights basket, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> began releasing official reserve assets figures on a monthly basis rather than quarterly from July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Policymakers in Beijing have been caught between a rock and a hard place on the road to full yuan convertibility. After adopting a more flexible exchange-rate-fixing mechanism on August 11 that resulted in the devaluation of the yuan and triggered a knee-jerk reaction in the market to sell yuan holdings, the </span><span class="s3">PBOC</span><span class="s1"> appears to have veered in the opposite direction over the past two weeks: stepping into the market to defend onshore yuan and imposing a 20 per cent deposit requirement on currency forwards transactions, adding to the cost of speculative trades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ANZ senior economist Raymond Yeung said the shift in direction might be due to unhedged currency risks held by Chinese firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The most likely reason for the central bank's defending was the large pile of dollar-denominated debts held by mainland [Chinese] companies," he said. "But as the market already accepted a freer currency regime on August 11, it is meaningless to continue to artificially keep the yuan under 6.40 [against the US dollar]."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The onshore yuan ended on Monday at 6.3644 to the dollar, weaker by 0.15 per cent, with its offshore counterpart weakening more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Evans-Pritchard said downward pressure on the yuan would ease over the coming quarters as the Chinese economy rebounded, and that capital outflow did not necessarily equal panicked capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Capital outflows are not the same as capital flight," he said. "Much of the 'outflows' represent increased holdings of foreign currency deposits by Chinese firms and banks, or reductions in their foreign currency debts at home and abroad, as the yuan stopped being a one-way bet."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">President Xi Jinping and hundreds of senior Communist Party cadres have gathered at a heavily guarded hotel in Beijing to review China's economic performance for the year, and to hammer out the policy agenda for 2018. What can we expect from the conference, and why is it so important?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The annual Central Economic Work Conference is the first big policymaking meeting to be held after Xi consolidated his power at the 19th party congress in October. It will shed light on Xi's specific ideas to address unbalanced economic development, mounting financial risk and the yawning wealth gap - meaning they will apply not just next year but probably also for the next decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five key facts about China's economic conference[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2124750/five-key-facts-about-chinas-economic-conference]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China achieved headline growth of 6.9 per cent in the first three quarters, and the government has curbed the capital exodus and engineered a modest appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar this year. These signs of stabilisation will offer Xi greater leeway to tackle structural problems in the world's second biggest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2124750/five-key-facts-about-chinas-economic-conference]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the conference under way, US President Donald Trump has alleged that China and Russia were seeking to challenge American power and attempting to erode US security interests, labelling China as a “competitor” in his national security assessment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xi convenes economic meeting under shadow of Trump's strategic threat[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2124748/china-holds-major-economic-meeting-under-shadow-trumps-strategic]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Washington's growing hostility, along with expected </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> interest rate rises and US tax cut plans, may hurt China's trade and growth in 2018 and generate capital outflow pressure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the statement issued after the closed-door conference is unlikely to specifically mention Trump and his policies, these issues will be the elephant in the room for Xi and his team.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists expect China will raise interest rates in the third quarter of next year, improve implementation of existing policies to reduce the tax burden on companies, and roll out more measures to open the service sector in a bid to prevent capital flight.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the conference is significant and closely watched, the meeting is held behind closed doors and its specific agenda, debating process and final agreements will not be revealed. A general summary of conclusions will be published after the meeting, but details such as development targets for 2018 will not be released until March.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a Politburo statement from a meeting earlier this month, the conference will focus on three key tasks­­ - containing financial risk, poverty alleviation and environment protection - as well as deepening “supply-side structural reforms”, a hallmark of Xi's economic policy.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But even after Xi lays out the country's economic priorities with his comrades, actually implementing them could be messy. One example is the government's push to tackle the chronic smog problem in northern China this winter by rushing to replace coal with natural gas for heating. Now the authorities are back-pedalling as they grapple with a gas shortage that left many homes and schools without heating in freezing temperatures.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign direct investment (FDI) between the US and China declined by almost a third in 2017 from the previous year, mainly because of Beijing's curbs on overseas spending and Washington's tighter scrutiny of Chinese investments, a new report has found.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FDI transactions between the two countries totalled US$43.4 billion, a 28 per cent drop from the US$60 billion recorded in 2016, according to research carried out by the Rhodium Group and the </span><span class="s3">National Committee on US-China Relations</span><span class="s1">, an American think tank.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Will China's stalling shopping spree regain its pace in 2018? Geely and Fosun offer a clue[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2136543/will-chinas-stalling-shopping-spree-regain-its-pace-2018-geely]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The main reason for the drop was a decline in Chinese investment in the US to US$29 billion from US$46 billion the year before. The drop would have been even steeper if it wasn't for the US$18 billion in Chinese acquisitions announced in 2016 but completed last year, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American investment into China was almost unchanged at US$14 billion compared with US$13.8 billion in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing imposed a slew of new restrictions on outbound investment last year to address balance-of-payment concerns and minimise risks to the financial system stemming from debt-fuelled overseas spending.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In February China's top economic planner published a list of “sensitive areas” where it intends to restrict overseas investments, putting a specific curb on deals related to property, hotels, cinemas, entertainment and sports clubs. Weapons development, manufacturing and maintenance, multinational water resources exploitation, and news media were also included on the list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's biggest overseas acquirers to face tightened deal scrutiny by Beijing[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2130768/chinas-biggest-overseas-acquirers-face-tightened-deal-scrutiny]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, despite Beijing's best efforts to contain investment flowing into these industries, the sectors that received the most Chinese FDI last year were real estate and hospitality (US$11 billion), transport and infrastructure (US$ 10 billion), and health and biotech (US$ 2.5 billion), according to another report compiled by the Rhodium Group released this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chris Marlin, president of Florida-based Lennar International, which claims to be the US' largest residential property developer by revenue, said his firm has been unaffected by Beijing's capital outflow controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company has “only experienced growth in our time dealing with [customers in] mainland China and the Asian region,” said Marlin, declining to give numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Increased scrutiny of inbound deals by US authorities had also had an impact on FDI, the research found. The biggest such deal to fall through was aluminium giant </span><span class="s3">China Zhongwang Holdings</span><span class="s1">' proposed US$2.3 billion acquisition of Aleris in November after regulators cancelled it over economic and national security concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In terms of FDI flowing the other way, the report argues that China's commitment to further market reforms is less certain now than it was in the years immediately after the 2013 “third plenum” talks in which the leadership promised a “decisive” role for markets in the economy. A perceived lack of progress in implementing change has left potential foreign investors with doubts about Beijing's seriousness about levelling the playing field for non-native businesses, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“To date, even as hundreds of thousands Chinese receive paychecks from US companies, numerous sectors in China remain closed or restricted to foreign investment,” said Stephen Orlins, president of the </span><span class="s3">National Committee on US-China Relations</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“These restrictions do a disservice to the overwhelming majority of China's people, as they not only drive up prices but also limit consumer choices. These restrictions contribute to a view in the US that China does not play fair.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report's release coincides with the </span><span class="s3">Boao Forum</span><span class="s1"> in the Chinese province of Hainan - known as China's Davos - at which President Xi Jinping reiterated his commitment to opening markets and easing restrictions on foreign investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Wednesday </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> unveiled a raft of measures to open up the country's financial sector to foreign investment, including the removal of foreign ownership caps for banks. Other key measures included allowing overseas investors to take a maximum 51 per cent equity stake in brokerage firms, futures companies and fund managers and completely removing caps on foreign equity in these sectors within three years.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Expectations for when the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will initiate its rate-tightening cycle have been dramatically altered in the wake of softer US jobs data Friday, with speculation now shifting to an extended pause that will leave rates on hold until next year, according to brokerage research.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The market has all but ruled out any Fed hikes this year," DBS said in its daily report on Monday. "On Friday, nonfarm payroll numbers disappointed (actual: 142,000, consensus: 201,000), sending US dollar rates sharply lower across the board. There was a level shift lower in the </span><span class="s3">US Treasury</span><span class="s1"> curve with 2-year and 10-year yields down by 6 basis points and 5 basis points respectively. Notably, 10-year yields closed below 2 per cent."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reorient chief strategist and head of research Uwe Parpart said the latest employment figures limit any chance for any US rate rise soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The US economy has just one nostril above the waterline. US equity prices showed modest gains after an initial plunge, as investors concluded that the decreased likelihood that the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will raise interest rates outweighed the impact of a weakening economy on corporate profits," Parpart said."The US economy has been weak all along. The </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s ‘print-it-and-they-will-come' philosophy of demand management failed miserably, but the Fed refused to admit, choosing instead to believe that the US economy had normalised (despite the fact that the US economy is 10 per cent smaller than the 2001-2007 trend would indicate). Threatening to tighten monetary policy in the face of weak US and world economy enviroments created the problems."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Societe Generale</span><span class="s1"> also said on Monday that after a week of disappointing US data, markets will be looking for guidance from Fed officials on the rate outlook in the coming days.Meanwhile, Socgen also estimated China foreign exchange reserves would fall by US$57 billion in September to US$3.50 trillion, compared with a US$94 billion decline in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The PBoC seems to have remained active in the onshore currency market," Socgen said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"However, a series of measures have been introduced to tighten capital controls on corporates and households, which may have helped mitigate capital outflow pressures," Socgen said. "</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign direct investment (FDI) from China into the US tumbled 35 per cent in 2017 to US$30 billion because of Beijing's curbs on capital outflows, tougher deal scrutiny by US authorities and rising trade tension between the world's biggest two economies, according to a joint study by law firm Baker McKenzie and consultants Rhodium Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The research tracked combined value of direct investment transactions by Chinese mainland companies, including greenfield projects and acquisitions that result in 10 per cent or above equity control.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fall in FDI is consistent with China's official data, which shows that its global FDI flows declined by a third in 2017 - the first drop since 2006, according to the joint report issued on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Han Yong, a senior official at the Ministry of Commerce, said on Tuesday that Chinese companies invested a combined US$129 billion into 6,236 offshore companies in 2017, a decline of 29.4 per cent year on year as “irrational investment was effectively curbed”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government had imposed additional restrictions on outbound investment to address balance of payment concerns and mitigate perceived risks for China's financial system arising from rapid overseas investment.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Growing regulatory scrutiny in many host countries did not help either, “with the </span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) </span><span class="s1">particularly active, impacting at least seven major deals”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese investors cancelled or withdrew 19 announced deals worth more than US$12 billion in North America and Europe in 2017 … more than two-thirds caused by overseas regulatory intervention,” the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cancellation of aluminium giant </span><span class="s3">China Zhongwang Holdings</span><span class="s1">' proposed US$2.3 billion acquisition of US-based Aleris in November after the </span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1"> raised economic and national security concerns made it the biggest withdrawal of Chinese outbound acquisition last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1"> is busier than ever,” said Rod Hunter, a Baker McKenzie partner in Washington.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Legislators are right to revisit </span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1">, which is straining under its workload, but should avoid handing </span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1"> a broader technology control mandate, a role better filled by specialised agencies,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strain on the committee was evident. In 2017 it handled nearly 250 cases and about half moved to the investigation stage, compared with 138 cases in 2007, when only 4 per cent of the cases were taken to investigation stage, said Hunter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">FDI from China in Europe jumped more than usual to US$81 billion last year because of the delayed completion of a 2016 mega deal involving ChemChina's US$43 billion takeover of Swiss agribusiness company </span><span class="s3">Syngenta</span><span class="s1">. If the deal was excluded, the value would otherwise have fallen 22 per cent to $38 billion, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report was upbeat about FDI this year, saying that it would be driven partly by the One Belt One Road Initiative.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now is the right time for Beijing to make important economic reforms - including shutting state-owned “zombie enterprises” and cleaning up local government budgets - the International Monetary Fund's chief China representative has said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alfred Schipke argued that the authorities were well-placed to act because the rebalancing of the economy was well on track and the government had adequate protections against external shocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its annual check of China's economic health, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> said the world's second largest economy would “rebalance to a sustainable growth mode” while its GDP growth was projected to show only a slight decline to 5.5 per cent by 2023 from an estimated 6.6 per cent in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Is it time Beijing ditched its ‘Made in China 2025' strategy?[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2149223/it-time-beijing-ditched-made-china-2025-and-stopped-upsetting]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The economy is doing relatively well, and reforms are progressing,” Schipke told the South China Morning Post last week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the baseline scenario, things are looking relatively good … Now it's time to continue the tough reforms.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">'s optimism there are growing concerns about China's growth and financial stability owing to rising bond defaults at home and a looming trade war with the United States abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Schipke said China's growth would be bolstered by the digital economy and external demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Both downside and upside risk are equally balanced in the short term,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Beijing would be able to handle capital outflow pressures, the dollar strengthening and corporate tax cuts in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Schipke said the impact on China would be limited in the near term as the country's capital account was controlled and the country still has large fiscal buffers - the balance sheet is strong, it has “ample” forex reserves and the public debt to GDP ratio is “not particularly high” even under a broad definition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It has room to react if needed,” Schipke added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One countermeasure advocated by the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> was a more flexible exchange rate system to absorb external shocks, which would grant Beijing a bigger degree of freedom to focus on domestic rebalancing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Things are good now: it's market determined, flows are more or less balanced, you just have some volatility, but it's up and down on both sides. So this is when you move forward a little bit on the reform side,” Schipke said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has welcomed Beijing's pursuit of high-quality growth - in which factors such as the impact on the environment are considered - but it called for a greater tolerance of the economy slowing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if the slowdown happens too quickly or if there is a domestic shock, Schipke warned against resorting to previous measures, such as investment stimulus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said it was important to continue with the course of reform and try to reduce economic distortions. “This is for China, nothing to do with [other countries],” Schipke said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also argued that disposal of state-owned enterprises and “zombie” firms had not been “fast enough”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SOE reform is critical, especially allowing the zombies to exit. Some of the entities are not productive. They not only absorb many resources, but also lead to debt and the misallocation of resources, ” he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Wednesday's statement, the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> warned that China's trade and investment regime remained relatively restrictive” and it should reduce the dominance of the public sector in many industries, opening up more markets to the private sector and ensuring fair competition.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Ministry of Finance announced last week that it would cut tariffs on cars and many consumer goods from next month, while the Ministry of Commerce also promised to ease restrictions on foreign investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> announced it would further opening up its previously tightly controlled financial industry to foreign investors, allowing them to have a controlling stake in financial joint ventures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Schipke warned the financial opening-up should be done carefully.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said: “The complementary reforms need to be put in place as well as on the domestic side - a strong and sound financial sector moving forward, with the elimination of implicit guarantee.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bull run of the US dollar will widen its value gap with most major currencies and result in major blows to some key economies that haven't built up enough resilience against capital outflow from their domestic markets, a </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Countries like Turkey and South Africa are in particular more vulnerable than the others to the strong US dollar and the changes in capital flows that it reflects, the rating agency said in a report released Tuesday, which cut the economy growth forecast for both countries this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"To the extent that the depreciations of the Turkish lira and South African rand in recent months are symptoms of shifts in capital flows away from these countries, economic activity will be negatively affected,” said </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> analysts led by Marie Diron.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To a lesser extent, Brazil will also got affected by adverse changes in external financing conditions due to a stronger dollar and that would push its economy further into recession. The agency forecast a 1 per cent contraction for the country this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the US dollar appreciated by around 13.5 per cent against a broad basket of currencies (i.e. in effective terms) in the year to May 7, 2015, the Brazilian real depreciated by nearly 20 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, the euro area may start to see economic growth to slow down from 2017 onwards as a more competitive currency does not address the structural weaknesses which constrain medium-term growth, it said. Japan's weaker yen's positive impact on its economy may be limited in the next two years, the report added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, the report said China is comparatively little affected by global currency fluctuations and capital flows. Instead, its economic outcome will be mainly accounted for by domestic developments and policies.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The nascent recovery in Hong Kong's retail sector is coming under pressure from a depreciating mainland Chinese currency, with shoppers from across the border expressing more caution about spending in the city as they get less bang for their buck.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Visiting shoppers the Post spoke to said the recent weakness in the yuan amid China's escalating trade war with America had eroded their buying power in the tax-free city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts warned that the yuan, which has depreciated 6.6 per cent against the Hong Kong dollar since the beginning of April, would remain weak and continue to put pressure on retailers in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland shoppers meanwhile should brace for more price rises as the trade spat rolled on, economists said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Renminbi depreciation will be a key factor in Hong Kong's retail recovery - whether Chinese tourists will travel and where they will travel,” said Mariana Kou, head of China education and Hong Kong consumer research at brokerage CLSA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company forecast the yuan to remain weak throughout this and next year, depending on the macro economic environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are likely to see a weak yuan stay,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's retail sector finally began rebounding last year after two years of decline. It has grown by double digits since February, clocking up 12.9 per cent in May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its fortunes are closely tied with mainland visitors, who account for three in every four tourists in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, US$1 was equivalent to 6.79 yuan on Friday. The greenback has gained 8.2 per cent against the Chinese currency since April 2, and 6.6 per cent against the Hong Kong dollar. CLSA expected the yuan to further depreciate to 7 yuan per US dollar by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Yibei, a 34-year-old mother from Guangzhou who visits Hong Kong every couple of months, said she would think twice before buying things in future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For sure, it is more expensive to shop here now, but I will definitely buy things if they are necessities,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cai Meirong, a 31-year-old Shandong-based agent helping clients on the mainland buy consumer goods in Hong Kong, said she faced a less profitable business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She would not be able to pass the exchange rate rises onto her customers in the form of higher prices, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Compared with shopping services in Japan and South Korea, products in Hong Kong are not cheap,” she explained. “If I raise the price too much, people will not buy goods through me.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Standard Chartered Bank Greater China senior economist Kelvin Lau Kin-heng was confident about the retail sales outlook, citing resilient demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The yuan will probably stay weak in the coming months, but will not be significantly weaker than where things are now,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing was unlikely to allow the currency to depreciate “too fast in too short a time”, to avoid risking capital outflow from China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And there were still plenty of diehard shoppers undeterred by the volatile currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ruan Yan, 33, from Guangzhou, who regularly visits Hong Kong to shop, said she made the journey because products in Hong Kong were authentic.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The cosmetics I get here are still cheaper than those on the mainland,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At least I won't get counterfeit goods here, and the products are more reliable.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She spent about HK$3,000 per visit, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong money exchange manager Tse Wing-leung, from Tsuen Wan, said there had been 20 per cent more people buying yuan in the past month, betting on the currency rising again.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another in Causeway Bay also said the number had jumped 20 per cent this month, with 70 per cent of the buyers being Hongkongers.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China on Sunday announced a big cut in the amount of cash commercial banks have to put aside at the central bank, a move that will unleash about US$110 billion worth of additional cash for them to lend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> said it would cut the required reserve ratio by one percentage point, effective from October 15, as a way of ensuring "reasonable growth” in credit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The easing, announced on the last day of China's week-long National Day holidays, came at a time when the world's second biggest economy is losing momentum amid an intensifying trade war with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, China is facing growing capital outflow pressure as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> is raising interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1">, Chinese banks can receive 1.2 trillion yuan from the one percentage point cut in required reserve ratio, in which 450 billion yuan (US$65 billion) will be used to repay their existing borrowing from the central bank and the other 750 billion yuan (US$110 billion) can be used to lend.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">State-backed UnionPay, the mainland's biggest bank card provider, said on Saturday it had banned customers from using its services to buy investment-related insurance products in Hong Kong with immediate effect, the latest move by the authorities to try to stem an outflow of cash as the yuan continues to weaken.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Holders of UnionPay cards issued on the mainland could no longer buy any insurance product that included "investment-related contents" in Hong Kong, according to a statement issued by UnionPay.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Customers could, however, still buy pure insurance products covering accidents, deaths and illnesses, the statement said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland investors have been pouring into Hong Kong to buy insurance products to hedge against the declining yuan and skirt strict capital controls to move money offshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purchases through UnionPay have not been included in the annual cap of US$50,000 in foreign currency that each person on the mainland is allowed to move out of the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purchases of insurance products by mainland visitors in Hong Kong hit HK$30.1 billion in the first half of the year, up 116 per cent compared with the same period last year, according to recent statistics from the city's insurance industry regulator.The mainland authorities feel it is a problem and they want to curb capital outflowsBernard Chan, president, Asia Financial Holdings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The figure was almost equal to 2015's total annual amount of HK$31.6 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It has been growing so quickly. It's not purely because mainlanders only want insurance products in Hong Kong. It's more about diversifying currency risks and moving money abroad, " said Bernard Chan, the president of Hong Kong-based Asia Financial Holdings and Asia Insurance.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Liu Dongliang, a Shenzhen-based economist at </span><span class="s3">China Merchants Bank</span><span class="s1">, agreed</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is one of the measures in capital controls as capital outflow pressure is getting bigger this month as the yuan continued to weaken against the US dollar," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ban may have a negative impact on Hong Kong's insurance sector in the short term, but will be of limited help in curbing the amount of cash flowing out of the mainland, according to analysts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In the short term, the Chinese authorities have made it more difficult for Hong Kong insurance companies to sell products to mainland investors on UnionPay POS [point of sale] terminals," said Ronald Wan, chief executive at Hong Kong-based Partners Capital International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But people can often find another way if they really want to move money out," he added. "So it remains to be seen how effective these restrictions are."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An insurance sales agent in Hong Kong, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said a lot of mainland investors might use other underground methods to transfer money out if the UnionPay channel was "blocked".I don't think the ban can curb the zeal of mainlanders sending cash abroadHong Kong insurance sales agent</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I don't think the ban can curb the zeal of mainlanders sending cash abroad. It may act like a goad to drive more people to buy insurance policies offshore," she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They [mainlanders] can always find a way out. Restriction policies often drive the panic in China, just like how crazy Chinese people have become in snapping up houses after authorities tightened home purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The more they restrict, the higher the property prices are," she said. "I'm actually quite optimistic about the outlook for mainlanders buying insurance policies in Hong Kong."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raises rates, there are growing concerns over capital flight and financial system meltdowns in emerging markets - and China, in the middle of an escalating trade war with the United States, is no exception.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week the Fed raised interest rates for a third time this year, reaffirming its outlook for further gradual rises well into next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Countries from Argentina to Turkey have already been battered by higher interest rates in the US as US dollar-denominated assets became more attractive, triggering capital flight from those countries that have seen their currencies weaken against the greenback.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">﻿Watch: US trade war has little impacy on Chinese growth says Asian Developer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighed down with US trade tariffs and a domestic debt overhang, China is vulnerable to capital outflow pressure and sell-offs. Already, Shanghai stocks have lost 15.6 per cent this year and the yuan has fallen by 9 per cent against the US dollar since April, an unprecedented pace of depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, said in a note that emerging market economies were already facing tighter financial conditions this year, “which have resurfaced some vulnerabilities as capital flows started reversing”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With the trade war rhetoric unlikely to de-escalate any time soon, the overall risks to US and global growth are clearly skewed to the downside,” Stupnytska said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The strength and stability of the US dollar has made it the backbone of the world's reserve currency system, maintaining liquidity and a safe haven status during times of volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China ‘supports millions of American jobs, makes big profits for US firms'[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2166065/china-supports-millions-american-jobs-makes-big-profits-us]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite Beijing's constant complaints about the dollar hegemony over the past decade, the greenback is still the default choice for China's trade settlement, and dollar-denominated assets account for about two-thirds of China's total foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the trade war intensifies, China has again argued that the dollar's anchor currency status - and not China's trade practices - is the reason the US is running deficits in the goods and service trade with other countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a white paper titled “The Facts and China's Position on China-US Trade Friction” released this week[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2166065/china-supports-millions-american-jobs-makes-big-profits-us], China argued that the US used “exorbitant privilege”, a term coined by former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, to levy seigniorage - or profit - on all countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Facts and China's Position on China-US Trade Friction[https://www.scribd.com/document/389599862/The-Facts-and-China-s-Position-on-China-US-Trade-Friction#from_embed] by Owen Churchill[https://www.scribd.com/user/427423618/Owen-Churchill#from_embed] on Scribd</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“For the US the cost for printing a hundred-dollar bill is no more than a few cents, but other countries will have to provide real goods and services in exchange for that note,” the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“On the other hand, as a major global currency, the US dollar supports global trade settlements, and the US supplies US dollars to the world by way of a deficit. Therefore, beneath the US trade deficit lie profound US interests and the very root of the international currency system.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China also argues that low savings and high consumption in the US economy means that the country has to run a deficit to attract a large amount of foreign savings. “The US trade deficit is an endogenous, structural and sustained economic phenomenon,” the white paper said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economists said the dollar's status was a source of power for the world's largest economy.As long as you control the international financial system, you can ignore the rest of the worldYukon Huang, ex-World's Bank country director for China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yukon Huang, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and the former </span><span class="s3">World Bank</span><span class="s1">'s country director for China, said: “As long as you control the international financial system, you can ignore the rest of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that dominance is not total.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US dollar's share of currency reserves reported to the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> dropped to a four-year low in the first quarter of US$6.499 trillion, or 62.48 per cent of allocated reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was the lowest level since it reached 61.24 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> data. The share of the reserves in euro, yuan and sterling rose during the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, Beijing has various tools at its disposal to avoid any exodus of funds or sharp depreciation in the yuan, including draconian controls over outbound payments and wider channels for inflows.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at </span><span class="s3">Westpac Banking</span><span class="s1">, said demand for China's onshore government bonds showed that investors were not losing confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also promised this month that China would not use the yuan as a weapon in the trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But while China can temporarily shield its financial markets from fallout from the Fed, it could lose an economic war if US dollar dominance continues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“All America has to do to preserve its economic dominance is to grow 2 per cent a year for the next 20 or 30 years,” Huang said. “[This is because] America's gross domestic product per capita is seven times as large as China's. The gap between China and America just gets bigger and bigger.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah says it is hard to predict how the Fed's decision to raise the US interest rate last week will affect Hong Kong, but the city's financial system is solid enough to overcome any volatile capital flow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his weekly blog , Tsang says Hong Kong, which is vulnerable to overseas economic situations, should closely monitor whether asset prices are volatile and, if so, whether this will hurt appetite for shopping and investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The US raised its interest rate a quarter percentage point last week, the first increase in a decade, sparking what Tsang described as "worries or concern" on the city's economic prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He cited that Hong Kong saw mixed reactions to three rounds of interest rate increases in 1994-1995; 1999-2000 and 2004-2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng benchmark index slipped in the six months after the rate rise in 1994-1995 but not the other round in 1999-2000, which means the city's economic health does not necessarily turn sour as a result, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This shows the reactions of higher interest rates to economic and financial markets are hard to predict," he said. "The US interest rate is only one factor affecting the global economy."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, Hong Kong faces the risk of capital outflow after an accumulated US$130 billion of capital poured in the city after the US and Europe launched quantitative easing programmes to soothe their economic wounds following the global financial crisis in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury, Ceajer Chan Ka-keung, warned yesterday that investors should be cautious about risk management and be prepared for any financial downturn as the city is enveloped in more uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"In spite of the US interest rate rise, Europe central banks further relax their monetary policies, which causes more volatility to global financial markets, currency and capital flow," he said. "Together with the mainland's economic slump, the interest rate rise brings challenges to Hong Kong." But he and Tsang believed the city's solid financial system would be able to counter any outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, speaking at </span><span class="s3">RTHK</span><span class="s1">'s City Forum yesterday, Centaline Property Agency co-founder Shih Wing-ching said the interest rate rise should have little substantive impact on Hong Kong's property market for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The Fed's current policy is relatively transparent. There are had been discussions of raising the interest rate for almost a year. already. So the market has already digested its impact," said Shih.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I think the rise will have little substantive impact for now. But, psychologically, I can see investors becoming increasingly pessimistic about the market later."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is not manipulating its currency and will not use it as a trade weapon against the US, a senior </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> official said on Tuesday, directly refuting Donald Trump's allegation on Monday that Beijing is deliberately devaluing the yuan to gain an advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Bo, the director of the monetary policy department within the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, told a briefing in Beijing that the exchange rate of the yuan, also known as the renminbi, is now decided by market demand and supply.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We'd like to stress that [the exchange rate] is market-driven. We won't use policy to devalue the yuan and we won't use the exchange rate as a weapon to react to external pressures from trade conflicts,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Li did not name Trump directly, his comments came a day after the US president charged in an interview with Reuters that China is manipulating its currency to offset the effects of the trade tariffs imposed by Washington. It was Trump's latest in a string of accusations that Beijing is not playing fair with the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump complained repeatedly about the yuan during the 2016 presidential election campaign, promising to formally label China a currency manipulator if he was elected. However, he toned down his rhetoric after he assumed office, and Trump's Treasury has never formally referred to China as a manipulator in its semi-annual currency reports to Congress.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trump's complaints about the yuan resurfaced last month when the Chinese currency was in the midst of a sustained decline against the US dollar. In an interview with CNBC in July, Trump said a strong dollar put the US at a disadvantage while the Chinese yuan “was dropping like a rock.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese side has consistently denied allegations that it is devaluing the yuan to gain a trade advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In reality, the central bank has worked hard to avoid a rapid depreciation in yuan against the dollar, because a sharp fall would amplify capital outflow pressures and generate fresh financial risks for the Chinese economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After the yuan weakened to below 6.9 against the greenback last week, the central bank adopted a series of regulatory changes - including requiring banks to hold a 20 per cent provision against the value of their foreign-exchange forward contracts and banning banks in onshore free-trade zones from lending yuan to offshore clients - to defend the key psychological level of 7 to the dollar, as it had in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The verbal dispute between Trump and </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> over the yuan came as the two countries remained locked in an escalating trade war.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The imminent launch of Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect, a sign of the mainland capital market's return to liberalisation, has heightened speculation over other potential cross-border share-trading schemes amid a growing desire for Chinese investors to diversify their assets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's green light for the stock connect linking Shenzhen and Hong Kong markets, likely to be operational within four months, was interpreted as a move to allay concerns about tighter longer term regulation of the A-share market following a disastrous stock crash last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share-trading link system between Shenzhen and Hong Kong represented Beijing's willingness to further open up the capital market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese financial regulators have taken a cautious stance on liberalisation since markets were battered in mid-2015, worried that any action would trigger a further slide of key indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment community is now anticipating a distribution of new foreign-exchange quota for the qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) and qualified domestic limited partner (QDLP) schemes, both of which allow domestic investors to buy overseas-listed equities.It will be up to the foreign-exchange regulator to make a final decision, but it's apparent that appetite for buying foreign-listed equities is highTan Jialong, Zendai Group</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will be up to the foreign-exchange regulator to make a final decision, but it's apparent that appetite for buying foreign-listed equities is high," said Tan Jialong, director of Zendai Group's investment division. "Indeed, cross-border equity investment helps China internationalise its currency [yuan]."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fears of rampant capital outflow and a weaker yuan prompted regulators to put on hold the QDII and QDLP schemes without granting new foreign-exchange quota since 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">QDII lets mainland institutions including banks, mutual fund houses and insurers raise yuan funds from clients before converting them into foreign currencies for equity investment abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">QDLP, a pilot scheme in Shanghai, enables foreign hedge funds to raise money on the mainland before converting them into foreign currencies for purchases of overseas shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both schemes are subject to foreign-exchange quotas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Free-trade Zone has also been mulling a plan to give individuals greater flexibility in buying foreign-listed shares via the qualified domestic individual investor (QDII2) scheme, which was put on hold by regulators earlier this year due to stability concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock connect systems allow mainland investors to buy a limited number of stocks in Hong Kong. However, under the QDII and QDLP programmes mainland investors can purchase equities in markets beyond Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators in Hong Kong and the mainland scrapped the limits on how much investors could buy on each other's markets after announcing the decision to implement the Shenzhen-Hong Kong connect scheme. This included removing the previous investment cap imposed on the Shanghai-Hong Kong share-trading link inaugurated in late 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The needs for additional quota for the outbound equity investment systems are increasing," said Ivan Shi, research head of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. "The market is expecting diverse investment channels and investment strategies through which mainlanders can access foreign shares."?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the stock link systems remain inadequate given increasing interest by mainland investors in buying foreign-listed shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Local investors have been disappointed at the lacklustre performance of A shares and economic fundamentals in China. They were expecting a strong rebound early this year after the benchmark indicator slumped 10 per cent in the first trading week of 2016 due to two trading suspensions, a result of the unsuccessful circuit-breaker mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, at the close of trading on Friday the Shanghai Composite Index was 2.5 per cent below the 3,186.41 close seen on January 8.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The sluggish market has exhausted investors' patience," said Dong Jun, a Shanghai-based hedge fund manager. "Some of them are setting their eyes on foreign stocks, which is also a move to hedge against a depreciating yuan."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> has the decision-making control on additional quota for the three cross-border equity investment schemes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has been striving to keep the exchange rate stable after it carried out a one-off devaluation of the yuan last August and reformed the mechanism for setting the daily reference rate.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China should enhance and strengthen the role of the yuan as an international reserve currency, a senior </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> official said in an article published hours after US President Donald Trump said China would not be labelled as a currency manipulator[https://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2087234/trump-says-china-not-currency-manipulator-and-adds-us-dollar].</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The article by Zhu Jun, head of international department at the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, published in the official Shanghai Securities News on Thursday, reflected Beijing's regained confidence in boosting the global profile of the yuan - a longstanding target that had been put on the back burner since late 2015 when Beijing's priority shifted to stemming capital outflow and the currency's depreciation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing highly likely to offer US import concessions — but impact more political rather than economic[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2087082/beijing-highly-likely-offer-us-import-concessions-impact-more-political]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu said China should work hard to promote the yuan's international use partly because that its inclusion in the Special Drawing Rights currency basket of the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> is not permanent, and that the composition of basket will be reviewed in 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's a short time since the yuan was included in the SDR currency basket and it's still in the start-up phase as a freely usable currency and as an international reserve currency,” Zhu wrote. “The yuan needs many more years of effort to demonstrate its advantage as an international reserve currency.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China will get better US trade deal if it solves N Korea problem, says Trump[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2086777/china-will-get-better-us-trade-deal-if-it-solves-n]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The central bank official added that much work remained to consolidate global confidence in the currency, raising international “tolerance for its fluctuation flexibility” and to reduce the possibility of capital flight resulting from lack of confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In particular, Zhu said, China should make the yuan “more freely usable”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhu's comments are a departure from Beijing's attitude of a few months ago when the country was in emergency mode and imposing stricter conditions on outbound investment and payments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Uncertainties intensified for the central government late last year when Trump threatened on the presidential campaign trail to label China a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, just as the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> turned hawkish on interest rates.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But China's fortunes improved in the last couple of months after Trump muted his trade war threats, capital outflows ebbed and domestic growth stabilised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A week after Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed at their summit in Florida to start 100-day talks to solve the US trade imbalance, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that China had not manipulated its currency for months, and added that the US dollar was getting too strong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They're not currency manipulators,” Trump said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, China's exports in March surged 16.4 per cent from a year earlier in US dollar terms, reversing a 1.3 per cent drop a month earlier and generating a trade surplus of US$24 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huang Songping, a spokesman for China's customs administration, said in Beijing on Thursday that China's trade surplus with the US widened in the first quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Huang said the bilateral trade surplus was a result of China's position in the international value chain, namely importing components and exporting finished products, and the fact that the US restricts sales of certain hi-tech products to China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's yuan exchange rate against the dollar has been hovering around 6.9 for months. The yuan/dollar mid-price in the onshore market was set at 6.8651 on Thursday, a significant appreciation from the day before when Trump said the dollar was “getting too strong”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency,” Trump said in the Wall Street Journal interview.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong and China shares may continue to see sell-off risks in the coming week as weak economic data due on Wednesday could become a new trigger for a correction in the market and as capital continues to flow out of the country in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Statistics Bureau is set to announce a basket of economic data on Wednesday, including monthly report on housing market sales, fixed asset investment, and consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The key Shanghai Composite Index ended the week 2.2 per cent higher at 3,744.21, while Hong Kong's benchmark </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng</span><span class="s1"> Index edged down 0.34 per cent to24,552.47, posting a loss for the third straight week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital outflows from Hong Kong and China equities are seen to continue, with global asset managers increasing their short selling ratio in some key indexes and relocating some of their portfolio to developed markets amid given the rising likelihood of a rate hike in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US jobs rose solidly in July by 215,000 while unemployment held at a 7-year low at 5.3 per cent, bolstering the view the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> will up rates as early as next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although Chinese markets had a summer sell-off, I still don't think direct investments in high-quality Chinese companies are cheaper than what we can get through international companies that have big business in China," said William Nygren, portfolio manager with Harris Associates. "Additionally, we like the legal protection and corporate governance protection you have when investing in developed markets."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong equities have seen two consecutive weeks of capital outflow while Chinese equities have seen four weeks straight of outflows, according to Jefferies global fund tracker data released on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign asset managers have pulled a combined US$372 million from the Hong Kong market between July 22 and August 5, while they pulled as much as US$11.3 billion from Chinese shares between July 8 and August 5, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some key factors that have shadowed the A share market will continue to overhang it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The leverage on the A shares, including margin financing and non-margin financing channels such as outstanding umbrella trusts, informal financing, stock repos and equity return swaps, fell from a peak level in June, according to </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">. But the total leverage on the A share market is still high.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Despite a significant drop from its peak, A-share market leverage is still high compared with other major markets'," said </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> analysts led by Shen Hu. "This excludes other informal channels whose total scale competes with margin financing, the balance of the latter accounting for about 2.6 per cent of total market cap."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some market watchers are worrying about the long-term impact on the Chinese market and the spreading consequences to the nation's economic reform programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The greater risk lies in the danger of letting the market mayhem become a distraction from the critical problems facing China's economy, namely the large and growing debt burden," said Alex Wolf, Emerging Markets Economist, </span><span class="s3">Standard Life Investments</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Staking credibility on their ability to overcome market forces risks damaging its authority in the eyes of both those optimistic enough to believe the government can actually defeat the market, and those who know better but can't believe the government is short-sighted enough to try," he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eleven years after it first set foot in China, Swiss investment bank </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> has become a leader in what has become one of the world's biggest capital markets, despite its tricky access and tightening rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Eugene Qian, the company's China country head and president, says in that time it has benefited particularly from its joint venture (JV) shareholding structure, set up in 2005 and approved by Wang Qishan, China's current anti-corruption tsar and then Beijing's municipal governor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Under a pilot programme, </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> was allowed to restructure the-then insolvent Beijing Securities, assume management control of the business, and rename it </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1">,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The arrangement allowed </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> to successfully avoid having any mainland securities company as a partner, and the need to have JV representatives on its board - often a tricky balancing act, that many new comers to the sector in China have to face.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was also able to integrate the mainland business with its wholly-owned regional hub in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Few foreign investment banks have achieved significant success in the Chinese mainland, since China opened its doors after 2005.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overseas firms have to set up JVs with a Chinese peer, in which they can hold no more than 49 per cent, and many have blamed their struggle for control for their poor performances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At a time when many investment banks are tightening their belts worldwide, to muddle through the turbulence caused by Brexit, Qian said his company is actually eyeing “significant growth” and expansion, including in its workforce, in China over the next four to five years, “given the enormous growth potential in wealth and asset management business on this market”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Some of the biggest business opportunities in China lie in onshore private banking - the demand from high net worth individuals (HNWI) and ultra HNWIs to diversify their assets has not been met,” Qian said, noting the available pool of money in the sector is worth trillions of US dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many of the ultra HNWIs in China are first-generation entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They are very hands-on company managers, whose personal wealth still largely remains in the onshore market, typically via stakes in A-share listed companies.”After last summers' stock market rout, more and more people have come to the conclusion that it is unreasonable to put all your eggs in one basketEugene Qian, </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">' China country head and president</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Moving their money outside the country has become tougher, as the authorities continue to tighten checks on cross-border fund flows, to curb capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian said </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> is well-positioned to help entrepreneurs cash out parts of their wealth from company shares, and transfer those funds into onshore investment products, including bonds, private equity funds and property or offshore investment programmes that are open only to institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After last summers' stock market rout, more and more people have come to the conclusion that it is unreasonable to put all your eggs in one basket,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">' investment banking business also offers its private banking clients investment access to competitive assets, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only a small proportion of China's rich, however, are still believed to have transferred their wealth overseas, with going public on the US stock market, the most popular option.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, being the “world's factory” for the last few decades, China has many manufacturing entrepreneurs who still find it hard to transfer their physical assets outside the country, Qian said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“A number of companies formerly listed in the US have or are preparing to relist on the A-share market to take advantage of higher valuations offered by the domestic market.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And this is making the onshore wealth market grow further, ” Qian said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Statistics from the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China (PBOC) </span><span class="s1">show domestic savings of Chinese citizens surpassed 40 trillion yuan (HK$46.40 trillion) by late 2013, and that number has been rising as the central bank continues to pump fresh liquidity into the economy to boost investment and economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Hurun, a wealth research firm founded in 1999 by the British accountant Rupert Hoogewerf, China had 17,000 ultra HNWIs in 2015, with average personal assets worth 1.82 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, all Chinese have a personal foreign currency swap cap that allows them to change at most the equivalent US$ 50,000 (HK$387,872) annually.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing launched the qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) program a decade ago that allows individual investors access to overseas markets through certain fund management institutions and banks.A number of companies formerly listed in the US have or are preparing to relist on the A-share market to take advantage of higher valuations offered by the domestic market. And this is making the onshore wealth market grow furtherEugene Qian, </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">' China country head and president</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the quota has been frozen at US$90 billion since March 2015, as the authorities battle against outflows, mainly being fuelled by further depreciation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has been delaying the introduction of QDII 2, an upgraded QDII program that offers direct overseas investment by individuals, a programme it proposed in 2013 as a commitment to opening the capital account.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian noted, as China's economic growth slows to the lowest pace in 25 years, and its frothy property market shows further signs of risk, more people are turning to other investments, and are looking for more professional management of their wealth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> plans to double its headcount in China over the next five years, with the majority in its wealth management team, which currently has 600 staff.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Acknowledging the efforts of the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the nation's top securities regulator, to step up its scrutiny of fund raising activities on the market after last summer's stock market crash, Qian noted investment banks should create a more diversified range of products, to offset, for instance, the stagnant IPO market in the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland China exchanges raised US$4.9 billion through 63 IPOs in the first half of 2016, compared with US$23.7 billion raised through 187 new listings during the same period last year.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since late April, the CSRC has also shifted its attention onto merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) applications by listed companies, particularly reverse mergers — so-called “back-door listings” — made by companies delisted from the US and looking to relist on the A-share market in an attempt to prevent cross-border arbitrage.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Qian said the impact of the recent regulations has been “limited” on </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Investment banks like us, think in advance,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2013, the bank helped the-then Nasdaq-listed Focus Media go private, restructured it through an M&amp;A, making it a bigger entity with a more attractive growth outlook, and finally relisted it on the A-share market, via a reverse takeover in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> brings innovation and thoughtfulness to corporate finance,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Between a quality company's delisting and relisting, we advise our clients to pursue a growth strategy to enhance its equity story, before seeking any return to the capital market.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its reverse takeover deal valued Focus at 45.70 billion yuan, nearly twice the $3.87 billion the company was valued at when it was taken private by founder Jason Jiang and a group of investors including a private-equity firm.Between a quality company's delisting and relisting, we advise our clients to pursue a growth strategy to enhance its equity story, before seeking any return to the capital market.Eugene Qian, </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1">' China country head and president</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There was little point in relisting the same business solely to benefit from the higher valuation multiples at home in China,” Qian said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In terms of financing, the market is becoming more diversified and the importance of IPOs have been diluted by other structures in the A-share market,” he added, noting </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> has been beefing up its bond business on both on and offshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As expectations for a US interest rate hike taper, we are helping more Chinese companies issue US dollar-denominated bonds,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Dealogic, </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> completed 19 US dollar-denominated bond deals for Chinese issuers in the first half year, a 35.7 per cent rise year on year. Total deal value for the market also improved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bank has been putting more emphasis on its M&amp;A advisory business, too, and ranked top in China in terms of deal value in the first quarter of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year </span><span class="s3">UBS Securities</span><span class="s1"> took the biggest market share (8.94 per cent) as a book runner for A-share IPOs, ranked by proceeds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And for general equity offerings for Chinese companies, both domestic and overseas, </span><span class="s3">UBS</span><span class="s1"> ranked as the second biggest book runner after mainland based </span><span class="s3">CITIC Securities</span><span class="s1"> in terms of deal value.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The yuan has been one of the best performing Asian currencies in the first half against the US dollar and may continue to maintain its current strength for the rest of the year as Beijing tries to internationalise the currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is keen to keep the yuan stable even if that means allowing it to strengthen against almost all other currencies as they weaken against a strong dollar, denting Chinese export competitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A stable currency boosts incentives for foreign trading and investment entities to choose yuan in their transactions, a key indicator in the technical assessment by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> in its review of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket - an elite club of currencies Beijing wants the yuan to join this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first half, onshore yuan weakened less than 0.1 per cent while the US dollar index gained more than 4 per cent. Offshore yuan strengthened 108 pips against the greenback in the first six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gap between rates averaged at 48 basis points in the first half, almost unchanged from the 47 in the second half of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"At this point, because the SDR review is still hanging in the air, there are some sacrifices as the currency is stronger than the regulators had desired," said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy, Asia, at </span><span class="s3">National Australia Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> has sent a team to Beijing to conduct a technical assessment of the yuan's eligibility to join the SDR basket. The review will be concluded this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The multilateral fund has formally changed its view on the yuan exchange rate, saying the currency is no longer undervalued and that it is working closely with China on SDR inclusion. This was followed by a G7 finance ministers' meeting on May 29 which agreed "in principle" to add the yuan to the SDR currency basket.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There is a delicate balance that the Chinese government needs to strike. Because in an environment of the dollar strengthening and other currencies weakening against the dollar, a stable CNY could reflect currency strength but which of course would not help on the export front," Tan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the </span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1"> review, the CNY will be allowed to follow the market closer than it is doing right now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Citing a similar reason, </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1"> recently raised its forecast for yuan to around 6.20 in the coming months, from the previous forecast of 6.29 in three months and 6.33 in 12 months - a 1.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent depreciation respectively from its current level.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The nation is launching the first phase of a globally centralised payment system by the year-end. The so-called China International Payment System will need a stable currency to encourage offshore trading partners to boost trading volumes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, capital outflow is something Beijing does not want to see, lending weight to a stable yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We believe the overall impact on the direction of the RMB is muted as policymakers have timed capital account liberalisation to promote two-way flows," said </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1"> foreign exchange analyst Ju Wang.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese property giant Country Garden said it is actively looking for investment opportunities in India, where it plans to acquire at least one residential land parcel by the end of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Developers from China have been making headlines in recent years for their ambitious overseas plans to build projects in popular destinations such as the US, UK and Australia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Country Garden, a Guangdong-based homebuilder, has adopted a different strategy. They have focused their expansion on the neighbouring countries, from Malaysia to Indonesia, and now they are looking towards India, the world's sixth-largest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mo Bin, Country Garden's president and executive director said in Hong Kong that the company sees big potential in India.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The population in India has almost surpassed that of China, and its economic growth is the fastest in the world,” Mo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We got very excited after visiting India, as their urban development is more than 10 years behind China.”?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company, which is known for building mega developments in China's smaller cities, plans to seek out local partners to jointly develop its first housing project in India.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The location will be selected from among six cities including Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, Mo said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The project amounts to an adventure, even as political and cultural differences are potential risk factors, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To curb capital outflows, the Chinese government banned its citizens from converting their money into other currencies for overseas property purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mo said he believes the restriction is a short-term measure and will be relaxed after two or three years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the company's huge Forest City project sitting on four artificial islands in Johor, Malaysia, Mo said Country Garden has to date invested about 7.6 billion yuan and the collected sales proceeds have covered the total costs, although he declined to reveal the sales figures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wu Bijun, the general manager of the company's finance centre who will be the new chief financial officer effective from April, 2017, said Country Garden's projects in Malaysia have been affected by the government's stricter capital outflow control.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that should not be an issue for its prospective India project, she said, as those homes would target local Indian buyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Domestically, Country Garden in 2016 reported contracted sales of 308.84 billion yuan, more than doubled the level a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company ranks as the third largest Chinese developer by sales, trailing </span><span class="s3">China Evergrande Group</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese companies were notably absent as the tender deadline closed for a costly commercial site in Central on Monday, while at least nine Hong Kong developers submitted bids.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Renown for aggressive deal making in recent times, mainland developers have been staying away from the city's real estate market since the beginning of the year, plagued by China's capital outflow controls and additional curbs on outbound investment in August.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong developers were active in the absence of their mainland counterparts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Peel Street-Graham Street site is planned to provide a gross floor area of up to 434,000 sq ft for office, hotel and retail facilities. Open public open space has been allocated at not less than 14,100 sq ft.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The site is estimated by property consultants to fetch between HK$8.2 billion and HK$11 billion, or HK$19,000 per sq ft to HK$24,000 per sq ft, making it one of the most expensive commercial sites to be sold in the city after the record HK$23.28 billion sale of the Murray Road site in Central in May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The URA is expected to announce more details on the bids in the afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thomas Lam, head of valuation and consultancy at Knight Frank Hong Kong, said mainland developers would be more selective in bidding Hong Kong sites under the tightened regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"They will prefer to bid on residential sites as the investment period is shorter," said Lam.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing took a further step to regulate outbound investment by announcing news rules on August 18, restricting overseas investments in certain industries, including real estate and hotels, film and entertainment and sports franchises.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China must press on with a “trinity” of reforms to fully realise an open economy, Zhou Xiaochuan, the country's central bank chief for the last decade-and-a-half, told influential financial magazine Caijing in what could be one of his last major interviews in the top job.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou, governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, said China must embrace free trade and investment, let the market decide the yuan's value, and scrap capital account controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the three elements were interlinked and could not be separated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's very clear that they are conditional on each other and none of the three can be spared,” he was quoted as saying in an interview published on Monday night.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At 69, Zhou has designed and promoted a series of economic liberalisations over the last 15 years, including freeing up interest rates at home and earning the yuan a nominal international reserve currency status abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Widen financial sector to stave off crisis, China's central bank chief says[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2099228/widen-financial-sector-stave-crisis-chinas-central-bank-chief]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he has also reached the unofficial retirement age for Chinese officials and could step down when the Communist Party convenes a five-yearly gathering in Beijing next week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Reflecting on China's opening up since the early 1980s, Zhou said China's position in the global economy was the result of a combination of the three liberalisations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“No country can create an open economy with heavy foreign exchange controls ... [and]an exchange rate set under capital account controls won't be a true market equilibrium rate,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou's advocacy of economic liberalisation comes amid concerns at home about the risks of a freer exchange rate and flow of capital in the aftermath of a stock market rout and rapid capital outflows two years ago. As a result of those concerns, the central government has imposed draconian capital account controls to stem outflows and intervened in the yuan exchange rate through a “countercyclical” factor.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Zhou said China should not wait for “conditions” to be ripe to free up the exchange rate system, nor should China drag its feet for fear of mistiming other reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a few ministries have different views over the time frame or conditions, then the likely outcome is to wait, to rely on others, and to request others to move first, which in turn leads to irresponsibility and deadlock,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> and other central banks that are independent of the administration in government, the </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> under Zhou is part of the State Council, the cabinet. And that means Zhou has to persuade other ministers and state councillors to come to a consensus on key reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's central bank chief plays confident, longer-term game on yuan stability[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2077866/chinas-central-bank-chief-plays-confident-longer-term-game-yuan]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said that process was an asset.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In my understanding, central bank independence doesn't mean independence from the government. In fact, it means an independent and effective monetary policy,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou also said China has been trying to find a new way to balance its trilemma - that it can only choose two of the three goals of free capital outflow, an independent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhou said China's opening could only move forward through the “ratcheting effect”, a reference to the difficulty of reversal once certain events have happened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There's an English saying; we've passed the point of no return,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing shows no signs of loosening its capital controls on overseas investments even as more Chinese firms pour into the European and American real estate markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't see any relaxation of policies. They're still very strict," said Paul Guan, a partner with global law firm Paul Hastings, which specialises in advising Chinese institutional investors on outbound real estate investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm recently represented China Minsheng Investment Group's property arm </span><span class="s3">SRE Group</span><span class="s1">, a Shanghai-based developer listed in Hong Kong, in its US$88 million acquisition of 75 Howard, a harbourfront condominium development in downtown San Francisco. The deal was completed last week and is the developer's first project in North America.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has been implementing tough measures to restrict outbound investments in the face of accelerating capital outflows since late last year. The measures include banning overseas investments of more than US$10 billion, forbidding mergers and acquisitions worth more than US$1 billion that are outside a Chinese investor's core business and halting foreign real estate deals by state-owned enterprises involving more than US$1 billion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But headline-grabbing cross-border deals have continued regardless.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March, Chongqing-based CC Land Holdings agreed to buy the Leadenhall Building in London, the Square Mile's tallest tower known as the "Cheesegrater", for £1.14 billion (US$1.5 billion). The deal marks the largest-ever Chinese purchase of British real estate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the same month, Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) made its third British investment, buying Free Place House, a London grade A office building, for £96.5 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong investors were the biggest buyers of commercial properties in the City of London in the first quarter of 2017, according to Savills.I don't see any relaxation of policies. They're still very strictPaul Guan, partner, Paul Hastings</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But these transactions were not an indication that Beijing's capital controls had been loosened, said Darren Xia, head of international capital group at JLL China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The restrictions are still in place", meaning those that could still shop overseas had a listed arm in Hong Kong or branches outside mainland China so they could use overseas proceeds or financing to fund the deals, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xia said that even though many companies still maintained their overseas expansion strategy, they were keeping a "low profile" because it was a very sensitive topic at the moment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The policies were unlikely to be eased before China's 19th National Congress this autumn, when the new leadership of the Communist Party would be elected, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, Chinese investors' demand for offshore real estate assets remains strong on the expectations that the yuan will continue to depreciate and amid skyrocketing property prices at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese property investors still getting overseas deals done despite tighter capital controls, says ING[http://www.scmp.com/property/article/2074450/chinese-property-investors-still-getting-overseas-deals-done-despite]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fujian developer Yuzhou Properties said over the weekend that it was actively seeking investment opportunities in Hong Kong and foreign countries to cater to the growing needs of wealthy mainland Chinese buying properties overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite increased government scrutiny, Chinese outbound real estate transactions soared 84 per cent in the first quarter of 2017 to US$7.5 billion from a year earlier, a report by JLL showed. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis, values were down 36 per cent, signalling an easing in demand amid the curbs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also said cross-border buyers were keen on office assets in the core central business district, retail malls and properties in niche sectors such as senior housing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts added that an emerging trend in property investment was to target countries along President Xi Jinping's "Belt and Road Initiative" such as Malaysia, India and Cambodia, a strategy that would receive policy support, making it easier to transfer capital overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yet the recent activity was the tip of the iceberg in terms of demand as most overseas acquisitions by Chinese companies had stalled due to difficulties in bringing money out of the country this year, even when the amount was far below US$1 billion, Guan said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau's top gaming mogul Francis Lui Yiu-tung has pinned his long-term hopes on wooing millennial gamblers, as he cautioned that a recent revival of the city's VIP gambling business is not yet sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The millennials are catching up. They are young customers that embrace technology and think differently,” Lui, vice chairman of Galaxy Entertainment Group[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=27&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], one of just six concessionaires to operate casinos in the world's largest gambling enclave, said in an interview on the sidelines of Global Gaming Expo Asia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Those are the things we try to understand more to ensure that Macau will be competitive in the longer term.”The millennials are catching up. They are young customers that embrace technology and think differentlyFrancis Lui</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The 61-year-old scion of Hong Kong's sixth richest man Lui Che-woo has seen his family's wealth soar a whopping 40 per cent last year, as the former Portuguese colony's fortunes made a comeback. With Macau's gaming revenues capping a 26-month losing streak in 2016, Galaxy has savoured a 69 surge in share price over the last 12 months, compared with a 35 per cent gain by rival Sands China[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1928&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] for the same period.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are mounting signs that China's high rollers are flocking back to the gaming hub on the country's doorstep, as exemplified by recovering VIP baccarat businesses reported by Wynn Macau[http://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1128&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], Sands China and peers. Macau's March gross gaming receipts grew 18 per cent, its fastest rate in eight months, bolstered by a 25 per cent uptick in revenue from high stakes punters.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While acknowledging that the return of VIP gamblers to the Southern Chinese enclave - only half the size of Manhattan - had been “encouraging” and “strong”, Lui said it was too early to tell whether the momentum was sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau's gambling industry had been hit hard by President Xi Jinping's crackdown on graft and extravagance that has put the profligate spending habits of tens of thousands of mainland government officials under scrutiny.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The recovery over the last couple of months might have to do with the currency or liquidity situation in China,” the billionaire magnate who oversees multibillion-dollar Galaxy, Broadway and StarWorld resorts in Macau said. “It probably will take a few more months before we claim that VIP is making a substantial recovery.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Chinese central bank</span><span class="s1"> has taken a series of moves to inject liquidity in the interbank market in an effort to soothe a credit squeeze heightened by US rate hikes, while Beijing is recently loosening its controls as capital outflow pressures ease.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Greater liquidity and freer capital flows in China bode well for Macau's VIP business in the sense that money becomes more easily accessible,” said China Merchant Securities analyst Angela Han. “But given that this segment is very policy-driven, its future well-being can also be precarious.”But given that this segment is very policy-driven, its future well-being can also be precariousAngela Han, China Merchant Securities</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While high-rollers playing card games like baccarat have propelled Macau's rise to the world's gambling capital and surpassing Las Vegas, Lui said the millennials were whom Macau casinos should tap into in order to stay “ahead of the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We know that these millennials like gadgets and technology,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last year, </span><span class="s3">MGM Resorts</span><span class="s1"> in Las Vegas launched a mobile platform that allows gadgets-addicted young customers to place bets on smartphones off casino floors. Lovell Walker, executive director of Interactive Gaming Development at the casino giant, labelled their new product as a “foundation for what we do in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to a study by the Institute of Gaming, Hospitality &amp; Tourism at Stockton University, only 44 per cent of people born between 1980 and 2000 indicated they were interested in playing slot machines, compared with 72 per cent of non-millennials who said the same .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui said conversations between gaming operators and regulators are in dire need to figure out ways to reach out to this tech-savvy generation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's monetary authority spent HK$9.96 billion (US$1.27 billion) to prop up the city's currency last week, but while the move is no cause for alarm, people should not expect the low-interest rate environment in the city to last forever, according to a blog by the financial secretary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar dropped to HK$7.85 against the US dollar at the end of last week, the lowest level in 35 years. </span><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> is obliged to step in to prevent the currency trading beyond either end of the HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 trading band introduced in 2005.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong dollar's recent weak performance is as expected, but Hong Kong's people do not need to worry too much,” said Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in his blog on Sunday. “The government has prepared early and has enough money to deal with the capital outflow.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the HKMA said it had sold HK$3.26 billion worth of US dollars. Its deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said that it stepped in to buy the Hong Kong dollar and sell the US currency in two separate transactions, one during European trading hours on Thursday, and the other before the close of trading in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said that at the time of writing the blog on Sunday, the authority had made four transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that since the introduction of quantitative easing by the US in 2009, there had been roughly US$130 billion worth of capital flowing into Hong Kong. The HKMA had invested the money, equivalent to HK$1 trillion, in highly liquid, high quality US dollar-denominated assets, which could be converted to US dollar cash quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Even if any significant fund outflows in extreme scenarios happened, the HKMA can meet the conversion demand,” said Chan. “The Hong Kong dollar monetary base amounted to about HK$1.7 trillion, which together with the US-dollar assets that had flowed in, acted as a large buffer against capital outflows.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With the capital moving out of Hong Kong, banks would see a contraction of their balances and they would raise Hong Kong dollar interest rates when the balances drop to a certain level, Chan wrote. At that point capital outflows would slow or even stop and the Hong Kong dollar would be stable.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is a normal operation under the peg scheme,” Chan said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The intervention marks the latest step in the tightening of Hong Kong's monetary conditions, sparking concerns among homeowners about possible interest rate increases that would mean higher mortgage repayments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan said that Hong Kong people should not expect the low-interest rate environment in the city to continue, and should be cautious when borrowing money and better manage their risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong people should … consider whether they can deal with the situation when interest costs are going up, and should also pay attention to the potential impact on their investments brought by the rise of interest rates,” Chan wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“People should cut their coat according to their cloth and better manage their risks.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Separately, speaking at a symposium on Sunday, HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam said the authority is committed to maintaining the purchasing power of the Hong Kong dollar, but stopped short of mentioning the recent intervention. He added that the city's Exchange Fund - the war chest used to intervene in the currency market - was “the final defence of Hong Kong's financial security”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A weakening yuan is affecting the implementation of China's ambitious "One Belt, One Road" initiative in its third year as analysts urge caution and rethink in Beijing's new economic diplomacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The "One Belt, One Road" push needs to maintain "a low profile" to counter the suspicion among neighbouring countries, said Chu Yin, an associate professor with the University of International Relations in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Huge potential gains of China's ‘One Belt, One Road' are worth the risks [http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1941104/huge-potential-gains-chinas-one-belt-one-road-are-worth]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The call for restrain came amid the slowdown in emerging economies, complex geopolitical situation, and criticism of the pitfalls in the initiative.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Global investment figures on the back of "One Belt, One Road" push, though, tell an impressive tale. Chinese enterprises have signed nearly 4,000 project contracts across 60 countries - at a cumulative value of US$92.6 billion - last year. The figure is equivalent to 44 per cent of China's total overseas project contracts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the impressive investment figures, there are concerns both within and outside the Chinese government that the initiative may have been "too hasty, too broad, too ambitious and without sufficient preparations for unexpected contingencies," said Christopher Johnson, a senior researcher with the </span><span class="s3">Center for Strategic and International Studies</span><span class="s1"> in Washington, in a research report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides, the steps taken by Chinese regulators to defend the yuan and to stem capital outflow after the currency's sharp depreciation late last year has increased the costs for companies</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">in currency settlement in their overseas businesses, Chu said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The use of the yuan as a settlement currency overseas is a problem as the government is very cautious to take bold steps out of fear of creating a shorting offshore yuan," said Chu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added: "Moves such as draining offshore yuan are a retreat of the currency's global push. Companies are facing complicated process in currency settlement along with its very limited use in the region [southeast Asia]."As of now, the financial stability tops regulators' considerations and not the yuan's globalisationWang Jiaqiang, researcher with Bank of China</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the slowdown in yuan's globalisation could be temporary, said Wang Jiaqiang, a researcher with Bank of China, the biggest foreign exchange trading bank. "As of now, the financial stability tops regulators' considerations and not the yuan's globalisation."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What is the One Belt, One Road strategy all about? [http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1900633/what-one-belt-one-road-strategy-all-about]?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is pushing its initiatives in Kazakhstan and other central Asian countries, which have traditionally been strongholds of Russia. Speculation is also rife that Russia is getting worried over China's increasing presence there as Astana wants to utilise Beijing's economic strengths to reduce its dependence on Moscow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While, in southeast Asia, Beijing is challenging the presence of Japan, which enjoys a deep economic penetration in the region for over three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Almost every province and some cities in China have set up funds or unveiled projects to dovetail with "One Belt, One Road", but what's lacking is a nodal agency such as </span><span class="s3">Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry</span><span class="s1"> to coordinate overseas investment, said an economist based in a Jakarta-based think-tank.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The ministries do not share information. Each goes its own way. Without proper communication with local people, it is easy to fuel wary about neocolonialism and speculation of China's real intention behind the push," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Profits should be the key focus, Chu said. "We should scale back the infrastructure projects as many of them do not make money," citing the profit ratio of some projects could only reach around one per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that some infrastructure projects were even at risks of default because of the market turmoil</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">in neighbouring countries, accentuated by economic slowdown in the region and capital flows to the United States.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"‘One Belt, One Road' is a high-risk project. We are bound to see some ill-conceived projects in the future, but it is more important to see how many are successful rather than how many fail," said Chu.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said China should allow more market access to foreign companies when Beijing itself is reaching out to other global markets. This will help dispel the speculation that the initiatives are self-serving, he added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian markets stumbled early on Friday morning on global uncertainties as investors adopted a wait-and-see mood, despite continued gains in energy stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong markets retreated from yesterday's three-week highs, and mainland stocks slipped amid weakness in the yuan as focus shifts to next Monday's launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.68 per cent, or 155.07 points, to 22,723.16 at the market open on Friday, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.42 per cent, or 41.93 points, to 9,850.38.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the mainland, stocks were mixed amid a weakening yuan, counteracting any positive sentiment from the upcoming trading link with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.14 per cent, or 4.64 points, to 3,277.95 but the CSI 300 — which tracks the large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen — dropped 0.14 per cent, or 4.87 points, to 3,560.17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.23 per cent, or 24.91 points, to 11,063.25 while the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> style ChiNext shed 0.05 per cent, or 1.02 points, to 2,180.91.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has rolled out new tightening measures on capital outflow from the country, amid the yuan's 7 per cent decline this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 0.65 per cent to 18,392.36. South Korea's Kospi was down 0.50 per cent, while in Sydney, the All Ordinaries dropped 0.55 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stocks across the board are falling on overnight weakness from US markets, which saw two of the three major indices in the red, and uncertainties ahead of the US jobs report set to be released later today, according to a morning note from Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors are also concerned about Italy's constitutional referendum on Sunday, which could determine whether or not the country will remain in the euro zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, markets were dragged down by index heavyweights, with Tencent down 1.65 per cent to HK$191.30 and insurance group AIA falling 1.07 per cent to HK$46.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau gaming stocks led in losses among the blue chips, as </span><span class="s3">Galaxy Entertainment</span><span class="s1"> dropped 2.80 per cent to HK$36.45 and </span><span class="s3">Sands China Limited</span><span class="s1"> lost 1.71 per cent to HK$37.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oil and gas companies are continuing their gains after helping to lift the city's markets to their highest level in three weeks on Thursday, with </span><span class="s3">PetroChina</span><span class="s1"> up 0.73 per cent and </span><span class="s3">Kunlun Energy</span><span class="s1"> leading the blue chips with a 1.05 per cent rise to HK$5.80.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Energy stocks had surged thanks to a jump in oil prices after </span><span class="s3">Opec</span><span class="s1"> member countries finalised a deal to cut production to address global oversupplies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong's markets still have "broad-based weakness," according to Andrew Sullivan, manager of sales trading at </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities International</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asian markets stumbled early on Friday morning on global uncertainties as investors adopted a wait-and-see mood, despite continued gains in energy stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong markets retreated from yesterday's three-week highs, and mainland stocks slipped amid weakness in the yuan as focus shifts to next Monday's launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.68 per cent, or 155.07 points, to 22,723.16 at the market open on Friday, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.42 per cent, or 41.93 points, to 9,850.38.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the mainland, stocks were mixed amid a weakening yuan, counteracting any positive sentiment from the upcoming trading link with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.14 per cent, or 4.64 points, to 3,277.95 but the CSI 300 — which tracks the large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen — dropped 0.14 per cent, or 4.87 points, to 3,560.17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.23 per cent, or 24.91 points, to 11,063.25 while the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> style ChiNext shed 0.05 per cent, or 1.02 points, to 2,180.91.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese government has rolled out new tightening measures on capital outflow from the country, amid the yuan's 7 per cent decline this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 0.65 per cent to 18,392.36. South Korea's Kospi was down 0.50 per cent, while in Sydney, the All Ordinaries dropped 0.55 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stocks across the board are falling on overnight weakness from US markets, which saw two of the three major indices in the red, and uncertainties ahead of the US jobs report set to be released later today, according to a morning note from Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors are also concerned about Italy's constitutional referendum on Sunday, which could determine whether or not the country will remain in the euro zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, markets were dragged down by index heavyweights, with Tencent down 1.65 per cent to HK$191.30 and insurance group AIA falling 1.07 per cent to HK$46.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macau gaming stocks led in losses among the blue chips, as </span><span class="s3">Galaxy Entertainment</span><span class="s1"> dropped 2.80 per cent to HK$36.45 and </span><span class="s3">Sands China Limited</span><span class="s1"> lost 1.71 per cent to HK$37.35.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oil and gas companies are continuing their gains after helping to lift the city's markets to their highest level in three weeks on Thursday, with </span><span class="s3">PetroChina</span><span class="s1"> up 0.73 per cent and </span><span class="s3">Kunlun Energy</span><span class="s1"> leading the blue chips with a 1.05 per cent rise to HK$5.80.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Energy stocks had surged thanks to a jump in oil prices after </span><span class="s3">Opec</span><span class="s1"> member countries finalised a deal to cut production to address global oversupplies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Hong Kong's markets still have “broad-based weakness,” according to Andrew Sullivan, manager of sales trading at </span><span class="s3">Haitong Securities International</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investor focus will remain on the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect's launch next Monday, but the impact is “likely to be muted and largely already priced in,” Sullivan said in a morning note.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The standoff between </span><span class="s3">China's central bank</span><span class="s1"> and global investors short-selling the Chinese yuan is poised to put off a long-awaited scheme giving individual Chinese investors direct access to Hong Kong stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII2) programme was expected to get a go-ahead last year as part of Beijing's efforts to further liberalise the capital account. A pilot scheme had also been planned at the Shanghai free-trade zone (FTZ), a testing ground for major economic and financial reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But on Friday, Shanghai mayor Yang Xiong told reporters that no specific timetable on the scheme had been set yet, adding that the local government was consulting relevant authorities on the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's difficult to give a clear-cut timetable on the implantation," Yang said. "We want to make sure that regional and systemic risks can be controlled and will launch the planned financial liberalisation measures at the free-trade zone one by one when the time is right."READ MORE: Chinese market volatility unlikely to stop launch of QDII2 investment scheme</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said Beijing's green light to the scheme could be at least several months away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Apparently, the focus is now on reining in capital outflows," said a source close to Shanghai financial authorities. "No concrete step would be taken in the coming months towards the launch of QDII2."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A depreciating yuan has become the primary concern for Chinese financial policymakers as fears mount on the possibility of fund outflows undermining the world's second-biggest economy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After a war of words between the state media and George Soros over the billionaire investor's claims that a hard landing of the Chinese economy is inevitable, Premier Li Keqiang has made it clear that there is no basis for the yuan to fall further. Beijing is now expected to put in place stringent measures governing foreign exchange transactions to check capital outflow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the planned QDII2 scheme at the Shanghai FTZ, local residents would be allowed to directly invest in overseas equities and properties, particularly Hong Kong-traded stocks, through banking accounts opened inside the zone.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese mainland media had earlier reported that individuals with financial assets of over 1 million yuan would qualify for the programme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The long-awaited liberalisation would follow the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect scheme allowing wealthy mainland Chinese access overseas-listed equities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Technically, QDII2 would likely incur a capital flight to H shares (Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong)," said Zhou Ling, a hedge fund manager at Shanghai Shiva Investment. "Seasoned A-share investors should understand that it's the right time to increase H-share holdings."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, the China-listed A shares traded at a 34 per cent premium to their Hong Kong-listed counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, worries have also grown that notoriously speculative mainland investors would use QDII2 to convert more local-currency assets into foreign currencies, betting on a further devaluation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese investors used only half of the 250 billion yuan quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connection system as of Friday, reflecting their tepid response to the price difference between A and H shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the stock connect scheme, a retail investor is unable to direct his money out of the mainland unless he buys H shares through a local brokerage. But QDII2 would give investors punting on exchange rates the opportunity to convert assets into foreign currencies before using them for stock or property purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thousands of mainland investors keen on owning Hong Kong stocks have taken advantage of regulatory loopholes to invest in H shares in the past decade. The cross-border trading system that links the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges provides arbitrage opportunities between A and H shares but has failed to narrow the price gap since its debut in November 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Those who want to buy H shares are already there," said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities. "QDII2 could be a double-edged sword for the mainland's financial system as some currency speculators could use it to transfer money abroad."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has reiterated that the proposed QDII2 reflects China's commitment to open up the capital account and internationalise the stock market. It is also supposedly designed to broaden investment channels for wealthy individuals increasingly looking to allocate assets globally.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in 2007 announced individuals would be allowed to directly buy Hong Kong stocks, but the so-called "through train" scheme was never put in operation as regulators made an about-turn over worries about capital exodus.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's property giant </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1"> said they are unfazed by concerns about a fall in mainland buyers for its overseas projects owing to recent capital outflow controls, as their luxury properties have attracted global investors, especially those from the Middle East.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The developer, chaired by China's richest man Wang Jianlin, has expanded its footprint to top cities across the world, including London, Sydney, Los Angeles and Paris.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have built up a very diversified client base,” Jim Miao, a senior manager of the International Real Estate Center under </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties</span><span class="s1">, Wanda's property arm, told the Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Aside from clients from mainland China and Hong Kong, many are local and Middle Eastern.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Middle Eastern buyers had been active, with one single transaction accounting for 20 units at Wanda's mixed-use project Jewel Residences Gold Coast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, Wanda launched a marketing push in Hong Kong for its One Nine Elms project in London and the Gold Coast Jewel in Australia. The product launches coincide with efforts earlier this week by the Chinese government to restrict yuan outflows, which has fuelled concerns that Chinese investors may put the brakes on their aggressive acquisition of overseas luxury properties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Douglas Su, senior manager of International Real Estate Center under </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties</span><span class="s1">, said the developer has shifted its focus towards international clients due to the recent policy tightening on yuan flows. He added that the company was focusing part of its marketing efforts in Hong Kong to tap potential interest from local buyers as well as mainlanders who can access funds offshore.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wanda's 57-storey One Nine Elms, the tallest residential building in central London, launched sales in 2014 and has sold about 60 per cent of its 439 flats so far, according to the company. Meanwhile its 512-flat oceanfront Jewel Residence project on Australia's Gold Coast, likely had a slower start, as it was reported that only 25 per cent of available units have been sold since sales launch a year ago. Wanda did not disclose any official sales figures for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company said they are offering units at competitive prices. The smallest flat at One Nine Elms costs about £1.5 million with an average price about £1800 to £2,000 per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wanda plans to speed up its overseas expansion and is eyeing opportunities in US cities such as Boston and Seattle, Su said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's new rules on "irrational" outbound investment from mainland China could spell fresh benefits for Hong Kong, possibly driving down land prices and injecting funds into the city's technology sector and infrastructure, analysts say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government is setting its sights on the opportunities offered by the new regulations, with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau saying the city could serve as an "effective platform" to help mainland companies with legitimate investments abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The comments came after the State Council, China's cabinet, issued a directive last week formally setting boundaries for outbound capital as the authorities attempt to curb what they have previously called "irrational" investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has set out three categories - banned, restricted and encouraged - as it seeks to "push ahead reasonable and orderly outbound investments", the directive stated.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among banned investments are those in gambling and the sex industry. Restricted ones requiring regulatory approval include property, hotels, cinemas and companies setting up overseas equity funds or investment vehicles not tied to specific projects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the authorities are encouraging companies to invest in the hi-tech sector, research, logistics and infrastructure projects that facilitate the Belt and Road Initiative - the country's go-global trade strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">‘Smart city' the priority, but my hands are tied on car pooling and sharing, Hong Kong technology minister says[https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/2106773/smart-city-priority-my-hands-are-tied-car-pooling-and-sharing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is well placed to play an active role to facilitate the implementation of the initiative and contribute to this major national strategy. We note that the State Council encourages overseas investment in certain sectors, such as infrastructure projects along the belt and road, technology, commerce and trade, logistics and financial services, where Hong Kong has distinct advantages," the bureau and the government's investment promotion agency, </span><span class="s3">InvestHK</span><span class="s1">, said in a joint statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We see new business ventures being established to capitalise on these emerging opportunities, with Hong Kong serving as an effective platform to facilitate mainland companies to invest abroad, in particular in markets along the belt and road."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But to fully capitalise on the new rules, analysts believe Hong Kong must prepare facilities and make mainland billionaires aware of investment prospects in foreign countries.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The regulations could also help cool Hong Kong's overheating property market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If there are fewer mainland developers investing in Hong Kong, then land prices will not rise so crazily," said Dr Billy Mak Sui-choi of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Baptist University</span><span class="s1">'s business school.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"But cheaper land prices will not necessarily bring about lower property prices. Constructing a building takes a few years. Property prices will depend on the market situation at the time."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On whether more mainland investors would set their sights on the city's logistics industry, Mak said the lack of space for cargo vessels had to be solved first.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also noted that these investors could be holding back because online shopping was not as popular in the city as on the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The academic said Beijing was trying to prevent what had happened in Japan. Many years ago, he said, Japanese companies went on a shopping spree for overseas property and entertainment companies. The resulting capital outflows caused problems for the Japanese economy, Mak said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Assistant dean of the Chinese University of Hong Kong's business school, Simon Lee Siu-po, said the influence on Hong Kong of Beijing's capital outflow restrictions would depend on whether any further rules were unveiled.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A huge sum of money has already left the mainland. Will there be restrictions on that? The directive did not touch on this part and that's a grey area," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Businessmen could be keen to invest in the city's infrastructure, he said, given that the Hong Kong government had billed the city as a "super-connector" in the belt and road scheme, helping mainland firms to go global.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said mainland investors would not be interested in investing in Hong Kong hotels - a restricted area under the directive - because most were now run by wealthy foreign companies, leaving little room for newcomers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Innovation and Technology Bureau was keeping its fingers crossed over what the directive would bring.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We note that the directive encourages outbound investment in hi-tech and innovative industries, as well as the establishment of research and development centres outside the mainland," a spokesman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"As technology cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland has become closer in recent years, we believe the latest directive will be conducive to [innovation and technology] development in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the Hong Kong Science Park, mainland companies made up about 10 per cent of about 600 companies there, a park spokeswoman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Information technology veterans said the Hong Kong government needed to turn the city into a first-class innovation hub first and train more people before the city could tell mainland investors that Hong Kong was a better destination than Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong has not been a popular destination for mainland [technology] investors. But I have seen improvements in the past one to two years, with the government offering grants. The market in Hong Kong is small and it's difficult to find enough talent here," said Eric Yeung Chuen-sing, president of the Hong Kong Software Industry Association.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If your IT business involves manufacturing, then you would probably choose Shenzhen," Yeung said. "But if we are talking about developing financial technologies and if you are planning an initial public offering to raise funds, then Hong Kong would be your destination. The difference between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is that the city connects you to the international market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Fong Po-kiu, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, questioned what Hong Kong could offer mainland and foreign investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Shenzhen has all the ancillary facilities to support IT development. And all the big IT companies are in Silicon Valley," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's clampdown has already resulted in a 44.3 per cent fall in outbound investment, to US$57.2 billion in the first seven months of this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's new rules on outbound investment could bring benefits for Hong Kong, possibly driving down land prices. --SCMP, August 23</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is all very well, but it does not mean much for homebuyers if home prices continue to go up. All it would mean then is that developers make bigger profits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sellers charge buyers what they think the market will bear. If there is a disconnect between the influences driving land prices and the influences driving home prices, then a drop in land prices will not necessary lead to a drop in home prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And in this case, there is a definite disconnect. While mainland money has been hot on the heels chasing land purchases here for several years, it has not gone into the purchase of completed homes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">My evidence lies in the first chart. The latest data releases show that, since the beginning of 2008, prices for flats with a floor area of 40 square metres (430 square feet) or less have rocketed by 212 per cent, while those for flats with a floor area of 160 square metres or more have gone up by only 60 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/23/9a1cc01e-87db-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_image_hires_190657.jpg]This was a reversal of the trend of the previous 10 years and I think it clearly indicates a shift in buyer identity. Mainland buyers purchasing for investments concentrate on the luxury side of the market and became less active starting about 10 years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Contributing to this trend was a change in the Capital Investment Entrance Scheme, a government attempt to drive up economic growth by encouraging capital inflows with the carrot of a Hong Kong identity card. Starting in 2010 property was removed from the list of eligible investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the market for the smallest shoebox flats is driven almost exclusively by local demand. Small flats account for by far the largest bulk of the market and mainlanders do not play there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus, price trends in this dominant sector of the market are unlikely to be influenced by the most recent capital outflow restrictions that Beijing has imposed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The single biggest influence on home prices has long been, and continues to be interest rates. We have a fevered housing market because the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the US dollar, and the US monetary watchdog, the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve Board</span><span class="s1">, has driven interest rates down to unprecedented levels for nine years. We have had to match this trend in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The result, as the Centaline Property Agency's Affordability Index shows in the second chart, is that servicing a mortgage for an average small-to-medium size flat now absorbs about only half as much of household income as in the previous property peak in 1997. Yet prices for small-to-medium size flats have doubled over this period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The difference is entirely down to much lower interest rates than in 1997.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our housing problems are not due to a shortage of land, or to too slow a pace of building, or to developers' greed, or to inflows and outflows of hot money from the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">All of these things may exist, but the root of the problem is that we are tied to US interest rates through our currency's peg to the US dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And there is nothing we can do about it.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The foreign currency regulator has shed light on the mass underground exodus of cash from the country, coming up with 10 top covert cases of people and firms moving money over the border.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said that despite tighter scrutiny, the outflows were likely to remain strong for years to come.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its list, the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> (SAFE) named and shamed five companies, accusing them of forging contracts or invoices to remit a combined US$226 million offshore since 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex reserves keep up growth spurt, expanding room for reform[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2093327/chinas-forex-reserves-keep-growth-spurt-expanding-room-reform]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Among the alleged offenders was Ningbo Big Fortune International Trade, which "colluded with several overseas companies", "forged trade contracts", "inflated prices to 5-20 times of market price", and moved a total of US$119 million overseas ­between August and September 2015, the administration said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company was fined 22.8 million yuan (US$3.3 million) for "seriously disturbing foreign exchange market order", the regulator said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Five individuals were also fined for moving up to US$4.35 million through underground banks to their foreign accounts.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In one case, a Guangdong resident used the US$50,000 annual foreign exchange purchase quota of 84 people to remit US$4.35 million to his own accounts in ­Australia and Hong Kong from December 2015 to January this year. The resident was fined 1 million yuan, SAFE said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The cases show how people are defying official efforts to stop the depletion of the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing has stepped up measures to stem capital outflows since the yuan skidded to eight-year lows and foreign reserves slumped to around US$3 trillion last year. Regulators have discouraged companies from non-core outbound investment and tightened checks on citizens exchanging foreign currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's forex regulator unveils new channels to attract capital inflows[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2065802/chinas-forex-regulator-unveils-new-channels-attract-capital]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">From July 1, it will also tighten rules for banks to report cross-border customer transactions to curb money laundering and funding of terrorism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Li Youhuan, from the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, said capital outflow was undeterred by stricter scrutiny "given the robust business I've seen by underground banks".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Measures to hold back company transactions definitely cannot work," Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Such demand cannot be eliminated as long as China opens its door to trade and exchange with other countries."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Renmin University finance professor Zhao Xijun said that while no financial institutions were singled out by the regulator, their role in abetting the capital exodus should not be ignored.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"SAFE is sending a message that punishment will continue," Zhao said. "Financial institutions will be held responsible if they ­collude."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, there are doubts about how long the mainland can continue to clamp down at the cost of normal trade and business activities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Andrew Collier, managing director of Oriental Capital Research, said: "They can't keep this up permanently because too many companies need to buy [other] companies or conduct external transactions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I expect China will need to depreciate the currency in 2018 to reduce the pressure on capital flows."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fears of large-scale capital outflows were renewed after </span><span class="s3">Moody's</span><span class="s1"> downgraded China's long-term local currency and foreign currency issuer ratings last week on debt concerns and amid expectations the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> would raise interest rates soon, driving the greenback up.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's outbound mergers and acquisitions to the US in the first six months of the year shrank on heightened trade tensions with the US even as the mainland's overall outbound deals grew and swung more towards Europe</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total Chinese outbound M&amp;As have increased since the beginning of last year, but deals in the US have shrunk as the dispute escalated between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping over duties and security on investments, culminating to this month's trade war and retaliatory battle of tariffs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Total value of these global outbound M&amp;As reached US$76 billion in the first half of the year, up from US$53 billion in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled by </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> for multinational law firm Baker McKenzie.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the value of US company buyouts, or 44 deals, fell to US$1.5 billion during the first half of 2017, from US$7.5 billion, bumping the US down to China's eighth top target market from No 2 in early 2017. UK was China's top market with US$15.23 billion at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Purchased US assets fell to US$3.7 billion in the second half of 2017, with 62 deals making up 5 per cent of global outbound value, lowering the US to the fourth top target country.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The escalating trade tensions between China and the US is certainly a major factor,” said Tracy Wut, M&amp;A partner at Baker McKenzie, Hong Kong. “The other would be the increasing scrutiny of the </span><span class="s3">CFIUS</span><span class="s1"> [</span><span class="s3">Committee on Foreign Investment in the US</span><span class="s1">] review, which has raised a lot of uncertainties around deal certainty and timetable.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Through the committee, the US has scrutinised incoming deals under the Trump administration over national security concerns, thwarting Chinese conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Dalian Wanda Group</span><span class="s1">'s proposed US$1 billion acquisition of American entertainment company </span><span class="s3">Dick Clark Productions</span><span class="s1"> in March 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Restrictions by the Chinese government would also have played a role in the decreased buyouts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's controls has restricted outbound investments since May 2017, reversing a record capital outflow recorded in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the short term, we expect Chinese investment in the US to dampen,” said Wut. “Chinese outbound M&amp;As, particularly to the US, may slow down, and the shift in geographical focus could present new opportunities for other regions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">None of the top five cross-border deals by value were of US companies during the first half of 2018, as the Chinese targeted Europe, South America and Hong Kong.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“China is actively courting the </span><span class="s3">EU</span><span class="s1"> with offers of reciprocal market access in an attempt to show foreign investment is not a one-way street, while trade relations with the US continue firmly on a downward path,” said Thomas Gilles, chair of Baker McKenzie's EMEA-China Group.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">, the world's third-largest life insurer by market value, has posted 50.6 per cent annual net profit growth for 2016, beating analysts expectation, thanks to robust growth in the mainland and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The insurer announced on Friday morning that its net profit rose 50.6 per cent to US$4.2 billion for the 12 months ended November 30, 2016. That compares to analyst estimates of US$3.8 billion, according to a poll by Bloomberg.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Basic earnings per share rose to 35 US cents from 23 US cents a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Pan-Asia insurer declared 63.75 HK cents final dividend per share, up 25 per cent year on year. Combining with the interim dividend, total dividend for 2016 was 85.65 HK cents, up 23 per cent from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">AIA's value of new business (VONB), a measure widely used in insurance industry that indicates future profitability, surged 25 per cent year on year to US$2.8 billion based on actual exchange rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The VONB growth also slightly beat analysts' estimate of 20 to 24 per cent, despite the negative effect from the US dollar against Asian currencies.We have made an excellent start to 2017 with strong value of new business growth in the first two months of our financial yearMark Tucker, AIA's group chief executive and president</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">VONB in Hong Kong - AIA's largest regional market - soared 42 per cent to a record high of US$1.2 billion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">VONB in Thailand fell 3 per cent to US$384 million, due to reduced activity during the mourning period following the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's state-backed UnionPay said in October it has banned mainland customers from buying investment-related products in Hong Kong, in a another government effort to control capital flight amid the depreciation of the yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The news has previously dragged AIA's shares down 7 per cent in a week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jerry Li Wenbing, an analyst at China Merchants Securities Hong Kong, wrote in a report before the result was announced that this year AIA is likely to see a bigger decline of business in Hong Kong as a result of the capital outflow controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Deutsche Bank analysts Esther Chwei and Lexie Zhou sounded a more positive note: “Notwithstanding a likely VONB growth deceleration in 2017 driven by Hong Kong business due to China's capital control, we believe AIA's strength and competitive position in Asia remains intact.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China is likely to "de-peg" the yuan from the US dollar in the second half of 2017, leading to a sharp initial depreciation against the greenback by the end of 2017, before the currency rebounds to around 7 per US dollar in 2018, CLSA said in a report Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The scenario amounts to a reprise of the harsh economic climate that befell Hong Kong in 1997, pushing interest rates higher, fuelling deflation, and triggering an initial property price slide of 20 per cent, said Amar Gill, head of Asia Research, CLSA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The overall trend is declining for China's foreign exchange reserve since the second half of 2014. And drivers for capital outflow remain...It is too early to say that China has reached the peak for capital outflows. In fact we are to see continued outflow of capital from the economy in the next 6 months" said Gill.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese authorities tightly control the movement of the yuan against a basket of currencies, heavily weighted to the US dollar, in what some analysts describe an unofficial peg owing to its tight tracking of the greenback in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If China's forex reserve declines by US$50 billion on average every month, which has been roughly the case for the past 18 months, its balance would shrink below US$2.75 billion around the middle of 2017, CLSA estimates.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That would be very close to the minimum forex reserve level recommended by the </span><span class="s3">International Monetary Fund</span><span class="s1"> (</span><span class="s3">IMF</span><span class="s1">) of US$2.5 billion, Gill said. He added that China by then would have to abandon its defence of the exchange rate and allow a free float to introduce market based pricing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"China certainly would tighten up control on capital accounts if the outflow pressure hangs over. But it is impossible for China to close the capital accounts," said Gill, citing in that case the negative impact would be even bigger than the depreciation of yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Experience of other countries where currencies de-pegged from the US dollar suggest that the local currency would decline by more than 25 per cent, at least initially.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CLSA expects the yuan to drop to 8 against the US dollar by the end of 2017, and head back to 7 by mid 2018 as it finds fair market value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pressure will spill over to Hong Kong, Gill said, resulting in a replay of the 1997 currency crisis that saw the Hong Kong peg to the US dollar under attack.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the Hong Kong Monetary Authoritywould defend the currency pegby buying Hong Kong dollars with its HK$3.479 trillion Exchange Fund.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, efforts by the monetary authority to absorb Hong Kong dollar from the commercial banks onto its own balance sheet, would lead to tighter liquidity and higher interest rates.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The above scenario may last six months before easing off when pressure on the yuan fades, Gill said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Also, as Hong Kong keeps the peg, assets on this market becomes even more expensive, considering the neighbouring markets, including mainland and Singapore, which is weakening its currency, that's why property prices are to see an adjustment and drop by 15 to 20 per cent," Gill said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Australia and North Asia, which have substantial trade with China, will be most vulnerable to the yuan's "de-pegging" against the dollar. India with the least exposure to China will be least impacted, CLSA said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Highly leveraged industries in China, including airlines, utilities, resources, shipping,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">and properties will experience volatily during the de-pegging process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese banks will suffer deposit flight, rising non-performing loans and lower net interest margin, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The greed of some property developers is truly breathtaking. At the weekend, a second batch of shoebox flats were going for an average of HK$20,797 per sq ft at Alto Residences in Tseung Kwan O, a 57 per cent rise from the first batch[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2078093/hong-kong-flat-buyers-put-57-cent-price-rise-new-development] sold in October.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Developer K Wah was also selling its latest flats at K City in Kai Tak at an average of 11 per cent more than its first batch only a month ago. Recorded sales at both sites had been poor over the weekend. A sign that the market is giving developers the middle finger? Maybe not.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">61 sq ft flats in Hong Kong? Why not just bury us in coffins and be done with it?[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2040613/61-sq-ft-flats-hong-kong-why-not-just-bury-us-coffins-and-be]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alto Residences is built jointly by Empire Group Holdings, owned by Walter Kwok Ping-sheung, formerly of </span><span class="s3">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">Lai Sun Development</span><span class="s1">, chaired by Peter Lam Kin-ngok. Lam is also chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The average person in Hong Kong no longer can afford even a shoebox; an under 300 sq ft flat recently was on the market for almost HK$5 million. Wealthy Chinese tourists had been among our most reliable flat buyers. That picture has changed, though, since mainland authorities have cracked down on capital outflow in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While those developers might have miscalculated, their price hikes at the weekend had at least one eye on mainland buyers. In any case, sales may be slow, it doesn't mean they won't fetch ridiculous prices in the end.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's in the nature of capital flight that buyers would grab any non-mainland, non-yuan-denominated assets, however inflated. While mainland authorities are claiming victory amidst signs of a reverse inflow, some independent investors and analysts have expressed doubt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waiting time to get into Hong Kong public housing shoots up a full year over past 12 months[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2070493/waiting-time-get-hong-kong-public-housing-shoots]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainlanders motivated enough can always take their money out, though they are usually billionaires and companies with offshore accounts. The small fry may be the ones most affected by the latest capital control measures, introduced in January. These have had an impact on flat sales in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Logan Property Holdings of Shenzhen and Guangzhou-based KWG Property Holding last month paid 50 per cent above market valuation for a plot in Ap Lei Chau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More mainland developers are expected to bid aggressively for another residential plot in old Kai Tak.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So while the small fry is being deterred, the mainland big boys continue their buying binge, and our government, through sales of high-value land, is aiding and abetting them.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock market is poised to receive a windfall from a renewed effort by Beijing to allow more mainland citizens to buy securities listed on overseas exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> announced late on Friday that preparations are under way for trials of its so-called qualified domestic individual investor (QDII2) scheme. The scheme is part of a big initiative this year to increase outbound investment by the private sector. The mainland's central bank did not provide details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is a key step towards greater financial liberalisation that is likely to be ushered in by premier-in-waiting Li Keqiang, who has vowed to pursue major policy reforms to stimulate further economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China, which had US$3.31 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves at the end of December, has been moving steadily since 2009 to develop the yuan into an international currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Individual mainland investors now can purchase stocks and other securities in foreign capital markets only through authorised funds under the qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) initiative established in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I expect the Hong Kong stock market to directly benefit from the QDII2 initiative," Hu Yifan, the chief economist at </span><span class="s3">Haitong International Securities</span><span class="s1">, said yesterday. "It could have a positive impact on the Hang Seng Index."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu said the new scheme appeared to be similar to the so-called through-train investment programme announced in 2007 to allow mainland citizens to trade Hong Kong stocks directly under a trial run.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was a ground-breaking move to direct capital outflow and boost investor participation in mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, which traded at a huge discount to their A-share counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The through-train programme triggered a buying stampede even before its official launch, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index surging past 29,000 points for the first time to set a record high in October 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the </span><span class="s3">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span><span class="s1"> scrapped the through-train initiative's implementation in January 2010 and merely expanded the QDII scheme for overseas investments through designated funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hu said the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> was expected to provide more details about QDII2, including the cities where it will be implemented, the qualifications for investors, and the Hong Kong or mainland banks involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last April, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it would set up a market-data hub in Shanghai this year to provide details on Hong Kong stocks</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's long-maintained “super low interest rate environment” may soon end, which could bring adjustment to the red-hot property market, adding pressure on family debt and assets, the city's financial chief has warned.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po's comments, in a blog post published on Sunday, came after 15 banks, including all top 10 mortgage lenders, which combined have 86 per cent of the mortgage market share, announced increases in their mortgage rates last week[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2158879/homeowners-feel-pain-hong-kong-banks-across-board-raise], affecting all new homebuyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Existing mortgage borrowers, who have a total of HK$1.26 trillion in outstanding mortgage loans, may soon face similar pressure as banks are expected to increase their best lending rate, or prime rate, as early as the end of this month - the first rise in 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In his blog post, Chan said the United States, which had increased interest rates seven times since late 2015, was likely to have another two increases in the second half of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the ongoing trade war between China and America would affect the US's economic outlook and inflation, adding to the uncertainty of the country's future interest rate increases.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong has to follow suit to increase interest rates sooner or later,” Chan said. “The past long period of a super low interest rate environment may soon end.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chan pointed out that about half of Hong Kong families' assets were related to property, which would inevitably be affected by any market adjustment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said the average proportion of family income used for paying mortgages remained at a record low compared to the level during the 2008 global financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The extra, more risky, mortgages provided by property developers only accounted for 2.6 per cent of all bank loans last year, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We can say that in general, the debt situation among Hong Kong families has not [created] any hidden financial safety risks,” Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he warned that general figures could only reflect the macro market situation, while increasing interest rates could still put “relatively big potential pressure” on families' finances.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He called on families to be cautious about financing and to maintain enough cash for potential market fluctuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has been consistently ranked the world's least affordable property market. As of the end of July, home prices had risen for 27 consecutive months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Economist Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, director of the ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, believed the interest rate rise last week and the upcoming increases would not be high enough to cause a property market crash.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After last week's increase, the mortgage rate now stands at 2.35 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is still a marked difference from the 10 per cent rate in 1997, when the market was peaking, Kwan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kwan said he was worried that the US's continuous interest rate increases would strengthen its currency against those of emerging markets, leading to capital outflow from those markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This could further worsen the financial crisis in emerging markets, such as the plunging Turkish lira after US president Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminium tariffs on Turkey[https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2159259/turkish-currency-craters-donald-trump-threatens-new-tariffs] amid ongoing political tensions, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that the crisis could spread to a wider region, becoming a global financial crisis that could eventually crush Hong Kong's property market.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Beijing has not announced any blanket capital account controls, the central government is stepping up its oversight and analysts say restrictions on flows of yuan and US dollars across the border, especially outward flows, are set to become stricter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing's retreat from yuan liberalisation comes at a time when the currency is under pressure to weaken further as the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> hints at an interest rate increase next month. At home, the central government's currency policy priority has shifted to "risk control" and is likely to remain there in the coming year as the Communist Party's top leadership prepares for a power reshuffle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said capital account opening would not be a key subject at next month's central economic work conference, an annual year-end gathering of communist leaders that lays out economic policy priorities for the coming year.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With people betting on a weaker yuan and many mainlanders scrambling to move their wealth abroad, Hu said "a very strong hand is visible there to curb capital outflows."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen customs said it had uncovered 1,012 cash smuggling cases in the first 10 months of this year, as individuals tried to smuggle cash out of the mainland in suitcases and handbags. A senior official with the Shanghai branch of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">, the mainland's central bank, said on Wednesday that it would crack down on capital flight and closely monitor abnormal capital flows via the city's "free-trade zone".</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the yuan's depreciation against the US dollar has been accelerating over the past few weeks and it is now at its weakest level in more than eight years, with the yuan-dollar exchange rate at 6.9.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Possible new measures from Beijing could include continuing to hold back on approving new outbound investment quota under the qualified domestic institutional investor scheme, slower approval for outbound investment deals, and lowering the cash withdrawal limit for mainland bank cards used overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I won't be surprised if Beijing takes further steps to stem capital outflow," said Yan Se, a senior economist at Standard Chartered. "At the same time, Beijing may not announce any measures but become stricter in implementing existing controls."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese banks extended stronger-than-expected new yuan lending in November but the seasonal growth is not strong enough to trigger a major policy response, economists said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New yuan bank loans in November grew to 794.6 billion yuan (US$115.09 billion) from October's 651.3 billion yuan, the central bank said on its website on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The loan data, released as part of the central bank's monthly financial figures, accompanied a slew of stronger-than-expected economic numbers suggesting the economy is stabilising, at least for the short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Medium- and long-term household loans - the majority of which are housing mortgages - increased to 569.2 billion yuan from October's 489.1 billion yuan and close to the record high of 574.1 billion yuan in September.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Household loans accounted for 86 per cent of the total lending. Credit to non-financial entities, including corporations, inched down to 165.6 billion yuan, or 21 per cent of the total.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At least 20 Chinese major cities have launched tightening measures to curb runaway housing pricing inflation since the end of September. It usually takes one to two months for the monetary data to reflect such housing policy shifts and economists had expected it to be partly reflected in the November credit data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The pickup in November home mortgages is probably due to heavy turnover earlier as it might have taken longer than usual for banks to handle loan applications,” said Chen Ji, a senior researcher at the Bank of Communications in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But slower mortgage growth would come later, as already indicated by latest housing transactions, he said. Data on Tuesday showed home sales in China grew at the slowest pace this year last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In November, total social financing - the broadest measure of credit supply, including loans, bank acceptance bills, corporate bonds and equity financing - grew by 1.74 trillion yuan, up from October's 896.3 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">M2, a broad measure of money supply, grew 11.4 per cent year-on-year in November, down from the 11.6 per cent reported in October and within the central bank's full year target of 13 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that the November monetary data did little to alter his view of broadly stable credit growth.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It seems scarcely believable that the average Hong Kong family now needs the equivalent of nearly two decades of income to buy a typical small flat, and is likely to need more soon, with the boost to price expectations from a record residential land sale last week. Two mainland developers paid a record HK$16.86 billion for a plot at Ap Lei Chau. The sale has firmed up predictions of a 10-20 per cent rise in residential prices this year. This partly reflects the government's high-land-price policy, not to mention its hoarding of the windfall - HK$60 billion above expectations this fiscal year - for infrastructure projects that do nothing to close a worrying wealth gap. It is also an example of Hong Kong real estate, with its protection of property rights and a limited supply of new land, being a haven for capital outflow from the mainland and a currency hedge.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's biggest landowners usurped by mainland developers[https://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/2074808/hong-kongs-biggest-landowners-usurped-mainland-developers]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a result of the distortion of the market by such factors, developers are building ever-smaller flats and selling them to first-time local buyers who think ownership of a home is more important than the size. In an ageing city like Hong Kong, this cannot be good for society. It comes back as always to land supply and the serious shortage to meet housing demand. The government needs to overcome its hesitancy to set some conditions for land sales that limit the incentive to developers to build tiny flats. Reluctance to interfere in the market is understandable. But the record sale at Ap Lei Chau, and the implications for affordability and liveability should spur serious reflection. At the same time, the government must not let up on its strenuous efforts to find more land for public housing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Public housing output is still falling short of targets set for the coming years, contributing an overall shortage and a price spiral that does not deter mainland buyers. The Ap Lei Chau sale also strengthens the argument for careful consideration of the limited release of less ecologically sensitive country park land for subsidised housing and residential facilities for the elderly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This would help reduce the waiting list and take some heat out of a market for private flats in which the number in the pipeline is on target, while the waiting list for public housing has blown out 50 per cent from the three-year target to four-and-a-half years.</span></p>
