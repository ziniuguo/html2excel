<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States will not be an easy option for the potential US$15 billion listing of Alibaba, which has been stuck in a war of words with the Hong Kong stock exchange and regulator over its listing plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Government and financial industry sources familiar with the situation told the South China Morning Post that the e-commerce giant would face similar problems regarding its shareholding structure as it did with Hong Kong authorities if it decided to list on the New York Stock Exchange or its smaller rival Nasdaq.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike the stock markets in the US, Hong Kong's listing policy does not allow companies to issue two classes of shares. What Alibaba has been seeking goes even beyond dual class - an arrangement that would help founder Jack Ma Yun and his management team retain control of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the partnership structure that Alibaba has been pushing for, the average shareholder would be even more disadvantaged than the dual-class listing model the US permits, and this is why it would encounter the same resistance there as well, lawyers say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the system allowed in the US, equity shareholders have the power to nominate or dispose of directors. Under Alibaba's preferred structure, they would not enjoy these rights, leaving them with no effective monitoring role, said lawyers specialising in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class voting structure is common in the US markets as many technology firms, including </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, adopted it to go public. It allowed the senior management, including the founders, of </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> to retain control of the companies even as they tapped the market for funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, if Alibaba wants to restructure the company's current partnership model into a dual-class voting model, it will take a long time to go through the internal processes and garner the approval of its existing shareholders. Besides, the partnership Ma prefers is not common for a company of Alibaba's size seeking a listing in the US, say lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong regulators want absolute transparency in disclosure as well as suitability for listing, which includes corporate governance, while the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> [of the US] is not a prudential regulator and focuses on whether a company's disclosure includes all information that investors would regard as material to their investment decision, including whether the company meets the corporate governance standards of the relevant stock exchange," said Steven Winegar, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong stock exchange operator have made it clear to Alibaba that there is no room for exemption for any company as listing rules do not allow preferential treatment of one set of shareholders over another. Alibaba may find itself similarly hamstrung in persuading the US regulators, given its history of a public spat with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> over a secret transfer of Alipay's ownership to Jack Ma's private company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba has more than 20 partners, including Ma, his co-founders and other senior executives. Ma and the management team own a combined 10.4 per cent stake in Alibaba. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, which together own more than 60 per cent, are not included in the partnership structure that was established internally in 2009. </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> have both said they support Alibaba's partnership structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma's problems with a US listing for Alibaba goes beyond the partnership structure. The bigger concern would be rebuilding his credibility on Wall Street after a 2011 dispute with </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, one of Alibaba's early investors and major shareholders, on secretly transferring one of the most valuable assets of the group to a third party.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma shocked Wall Street in May 2011 when investors realised he had transferred Alipay, a leading online payment system created and owned by Alibaba, to a private company held by Ma outside the group. </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> was outraged and some US fund managers even threatened to sue Ma in the US. </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and Alibaba later resolved their differences.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The case, which came to be commonly known as the "VIE problem" on Wall Street - referring to an investment vehicle called a "variable interest entity" that allows mainland firms to access capital from foreign investors through offshore platforms rather than through their mainland entities to avoid China's tight and complicated foreign exchange controls.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incident triggered a round of sell-offs in US-listed mainland firms, including Sina.com China's No2 web portal, as US investors became suspicious of mainland companies imitating the Alibaba case.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It is still permissible for Chinese companies to list with VIEs in their corporate structure, but investors are mindful of </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">'s months-long battle over the ownership of Alipay," Winegar said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a Xinhua piece in 2009, Ma said: "Let all Wall Street investors scold us. We insist that clients are No1, employees are No2 and shareholders should be No3."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked about Ma's 2009 comments, an Alibaba spokesman told the Post: "Shareholders are important and we respect them, but they come at No3 because they are the beneficiaries of doing No1 and No2 right."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba declined to elaborate on its persistance in a partnership structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prospects for a Hong Kong listing this year for Chinese internet giant Alibaba have dimmed dramatically in the wake of disclosures by investment bankers that the mainland's No1 e-commerce firm is wrestling with how to keep management control after shares are sold to the public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources say the desire of chairman Jack Ma Yun to keep clear control of the company he founded in 1999 throws into doubt the likelihood of a Hong Kong share sale given strict listing rules that forbid dual structures that separate voting and ownership rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">People close to Ma, who founded Alibaba in his hometown of Hangzhou, said the teacher-turned-entrepreneur had planned to move forward quickly with the listing of his </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1">, but that sentiment had changed in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment on its plan for an initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market sources say Ma has been planning an IPO of shares in </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> since August last year, when he de-listed the flagship trade portal </span><span class="s3">Alibaba.com</span><span class="s1"> from the Hong Kong stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But that would not happen if he could not keep control of the company, investment banking sources told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Taking into account Ma's personal 7.4 per cent stake in Alibaba, the entire management team owns a combined 10.4 per cent stake in the firm. Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1"> owns 36.7 per cent and US internet giant </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1">, 24 per cent, according to official information released by the two.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The most viable solution for Ma to maintain control over Alibaba's board may be to establish a mutual agreement with the two biggest shareholders, </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and SoftBank, who would agree to appoint Ma or his designated person to manage the company on a daily basis," said Edward Au, a Deloitte partner specialising in China listings. An agreement between Alibaba and its major investors </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and SoftBank is, however, easier said than done.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2011, Alibaba and </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> had a very public dispute over Chinese electronic payments processing firm Alipay. The two parties later reached an agreement that Alibaba would get paid at least US$2 billion but no more than US$6 billion if Alipay goes public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alipay provides payment processing services to </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> and its affiliates, including Taobao, a popular consumer-to-consumer portal on the mainland and widely considered one of the jewels of the Alibaba portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's current listing rules do not allow a so-called "dual class" voting structure as the US market does. The US system allows the management of a company to retain control through shares that have more voting power than publicly traded shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the New York listing of Manchester United last year, the Glazer family, which has owned the English football club since 2005, sold 42 per cent of its Class A shares to public investors, who would get only 1.3 per cent in terms of voting rights. Under the terms of that sale, Class B shares have 10 times more voting power than the publicly traded shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Glazer family had once considered listing in Hong Kong or Singapore before it picked New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some bankers with working ties with Ma said the Hong Kong securities regulator and the city's stock exchange might review and revise its existing listing rules to attract listings of technology firms such as Alibaba in the event of the US market unwinding the dual-class voting structure to cope with rising demand.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firms like Alibaba are often run by a group of founding members who own minority stakes due to seed investments by other investors during the start-up period, requiring special provisions for control by founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Should China's largest e-commence company succeed in hitting a market capitalisation of US$100 billion, it would rank as the third-largest internet firm behind US search giant </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, with a market cap of US$290 billion, and online retailer </span><span class="s3">Amazon. com</span><span class="s1">, at US$133 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing of Alibaba could easily run up to US$15 billion, which would be the biggest capital raising in the city this year.</span></p>
