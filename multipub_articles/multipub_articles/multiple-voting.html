<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In April, bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) introduced its biggest listing reform for 25 years with the aim of turning the city's stock exchange as a listing hub for technology and biotechnology companies which now are mainly listed in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the reforms have yet to work their magic for the exchange as only two companies have successfully listed so far. Biotech firm </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1"> made its debut on August 1 and smartphone maker Xiaomi in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Three types of companies can apply. Technology giants with dual class or multiple class shareholding structure; biotech firms without profit or revenue; and innovative companies currently listed in the US or the UK seeking a secondary listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new rules[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124972/securities-commission-backs-introduction-dual-class-shares-hong] apply to only tech or new economy companies with multiple voting rights shareholding structure, usually with two different classes of shares. Each share held by the premium class of shareholders - mostly the founders and other key executives - can have up to 10 times more voting rights than the others. No corporate shareholders are allowed to hold the premium class of shares. The company must have a market value of at least HK$40 billion (US$5.1 billion) at the time of the listing, or market cap of HK$10 billion and annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Opinion: Why won't Hong Kong stock exchange trumpet its advantages over China bourses?[https://www.scmp.com/business/article/1900557/why-wont-hong-kong-stock-exchange-trumpet-its-advantages-over-mainland]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Biotech candidates need not comply with the profit requirements of the main board, which stipulates at least HK$50 million of profits in the three years leading to the listing. They also do not need to have any revenue track record. However, they must have a market valuation of at least HK$1.5 billion at the time of listing, one “sophisticated” pre-IPO investor, a product that has passed phase one clinical trial primarily aimed at showing its safety, and has regulatory approval to begin phase two to prove its efficacy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech firms must already be listed on one of the three qualifying exchanges - </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> or </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. They also must have a market cap of over HK$40 billion, or market cap of HK$10 billion and annual revenue of at least HK$1 billion.</span></p>
