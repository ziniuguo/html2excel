<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar is expected to trade close to the 7.85 weak-side convertibility undertaking through 2019 because of rising volatility in the currency amid a string of initial public offerings and strength in the US dollar, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong dollar traded at 7.8487 per US dollar late afternoon on Monday after previously falling to a low of 7.8499, approaching the threshold for the monetary authority to intervene in the currency markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under its currency board system, the de facto central bank is obliged to buy or sell the Hong Kong dollar to keep it within a range between 7.75 to 7.85 per dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange points may be more influenced by short term events than before, such as IPOs,” Ronald Man, fixed income and currency emerging Asia strategist at </span><span class="s3">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span><span class="s1"> said in a recent research note.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure Xiaomi locked up about HK$23 billion (US$2.9 billion) in subscriptions in June. China Tower, the world's largest operator of transmission towers for mobile phone networks, is also planning to raise as much as HK$68.1 billion in an IPO, the biggest such sale globally in nearly four years. Retail investors can subscribe to the offer from Wednesday until next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But any banking liquidity squeeze is likely to ease once the IPOs are completed. That would widen back the US-Hong Kong interest rate gap, attracting currency traders to sell the Hong Kong dollar for the higher yielding US dollar and exerting pressure on the local currency, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One-month Hibor was at 1.8 per cent on Monday, down 33 basis points from a 10-year high of 2.13 per cent hit on June 25, when it briefly closed its gap with its US Libor counterpart for the first time since 2017. On Wednesday, the gap widened back to 21 basis points.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While interest rates on various fixed deposits have risen in the past months, the city's commercial banks in Hong Kong have yet to raise their prime lending rates. The Hibor rate is likely to stay below Libor as liquidity in the city is likely to stay relatively supported, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> has been raising benchmark rates in lockstep with the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> since the current tightening cycle got underway in December 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In interventions in April and May, the monetary authority spent around HK$70 billion to support the Hong Kong dollar, which has tightened the amount of dollars in circulation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, inflows into Hong Kong dollar assets and commercial banks that continue to refrain from raising the prime lending rates have partially offset the liquidity drain, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around the region, markets are poised for more weakness in Asian currencies, including the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar, said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy at </span><span class="s3">United Overseas Bank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Strong US growth and rising inflation indicators reinforce the </span><span class="s3">Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1">'s gradual rate hiking path, boosting the US dollar and Treasury rates, Heng said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">DBS Bank</span><span class="s1"> forecasts three-month Hibor to rise to 3.25 per cent by the end of 2019, up from Wednesday's 2.07 per cent level while three-month Libor was expected to hit 3.75 per cent.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet search giant Baidu, smartphone brand Xiaomi and Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft have agreed to subscribe with Cheetah Mobile, the security software company that plans to raise about US$200 million in its initial public offering in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts yesterday said that combined subscription, worth US$50 million, would help prop up the New York Stock Exchange-bound listing of Cheetah after the Beijing-based company - formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software - downsized its IPO from the original US$300 million that was filed earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah, a subsidiary established by Kingsoft in 2009, will offer 12 million new American depositary shares, each priced between US$12.50 and US$14.50. That would put Cheetah's market capitalisation at between US$1.8 billion and US$2.1 billion, according to its </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> filing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jeff Hao, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, said: "Timing is not on the company's side because Alibaba's own IPO will require a lot of capital from the market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba, the mainland's biggest e-commerce services provider, is expected to file for its share offering in New York within days. Speculation has been rife that Alibaba could raise more than US$20 billion, positioning its IPO as the largest in history.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Guotai Junan International</span><span class="s1"> analyst Ricky Lai expected the Cheetah IPO to still manage to attract investors with a specific interest on the growing mobile security applications market segment. "Baidu's and Xiaomi's subscription deals would certainly help raise the company's profile," Lai said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Once its IPO is completed, Cheetah will issue and sell its Class A shares worth US$10 million to parent Kingsoft, US$20 million to Baidu and US$20 million to Xiaomi Ventures, the smartphone brand's venture capital unit.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah has proposed adopting a dual-class share capital structure that would allow Kingsoft to retain control and continue to consolidate the unit's financial results after the IPO. This type of share structure is not available in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In its Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday, Kingsoft said the Cheetah IPO net proceeds will amount to US$147.4 million, or US$170 million if the underwriters exercise their option to buy additional shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cheetah plans to use US$50 million of the proceeds to expand into selected international markets; US$35 million to build up its sales and marketing; US$35 million to invest in technology, infrastructure, and research and development; and the balance for general corporate purposes.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record number of Chinese tech and internet companies are rushing to launch IPOs overseas this year, amid the looming shadow of overall tightening credit conditions, which bears a lot of similarities to the dotcom bubble and crash of 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just like what happened in the US nearly two decades ago, many of these IPOs are pushed by the need for cash amid intense funding pressure, as the cheap money era is coming to an end after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> kicked off its rate-increase cycle and there is no sign of China ending its deleveraging campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it is getting increasingly harder to access onshore money from private equity funds, companies are turning to the public equity market for financing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some analysts said many tech start-ups are trying to catch the last train in the current cycle like what the Chinese internet portals did in 2000, as the issue of survival has become all the more important when winter finally comes. To grab the window of opportunity, many would rather risk a valuation cut and stock volatility.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If history is any guide, today's breed of tech and internet companies could face a similar turnaround in fortunes and experience traumatic changes, leaving only the fittest to survive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, 13 Chinese tech and internet service-related IPOs launched this year, raising a combined US$6.86 billion as of September 21 - the highest on booth counts since 1995, according to Dealogic data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The data has not taken into account one of the largest flotations of the year - Xiaomi's US$4.7 billion IPO, which Dealogic categorised as a smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f17fde44-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The tech IPO wave is part of an overall listing boom. In the first eight months of this year, 150 companies listed on Hong Kong stock exchange, up 46 per cent year on year, based on data from the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is in sharp contrast to the market sentiment that has changed significantly from earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since July, nearly 60 per cent of IPOs have fallen below their offer price on the first day of trading. The eight biggest tech IPOs in the past 12 months are all trading below their IPO prices. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, China's biggest online car retailer, has seen its shares plunge nearly 70 per cent from its offer price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hang Seng Index recently entered a technical bear market, reaching a low of 26,613 earlier this month, down more than 20 per cent from a high of 33,484 on January 26. It has since risen, closing at 27,788.52 on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f1cfca08-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even retail investors' enthusiasm towards big listings has faded. Online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">'s IPO earlier this month was barely subscribed by retail buyers, who placed only HK$2.6 billion (US$332.2 million) worth of orders. That is less than one per cent of the HK$370 billion capital that Ping An Good Doctor tied up in its IPO in May. It also pales in comparison with China Literature's HK$520 billion lock-in retail capital last November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But bankers said the IPO window in Hong Kong is still open and will probably stay open for another year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We expect a healthy IPO pipeline in Hong Kong over the next six to 12 months, despite macro-driven market volatility,” said Sunil Dhupelia, head of equity syndicate for Asia ex-Japan at </span><span class="s3">Credit Suisse</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Chinese companies, primarily in the TMT [telecommunication, media, and technology] sector, feature prominently in the pipeline.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">John Hall, co-head of investment banking for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">JP Morgan</span><span class="s1">, had similar views.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is still a robust IPO pipeline and the momentum is strong. Instead of postponing their IPO agenda, most issuers want to be prepared to catch the right market window. The recent volatility has made investors more selective but they remain tremendously enthusiastic for companies with a solid business model.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance, a leading home-grown investment bank advising on tech IPOs, said the window to list in Hong Kong is open, partly because of the new listing rules that took effect in April. The rules allow companies with dual-class share structure to list and also make it easier for biotech firms to launch their IPOs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“2018 is a bumper year for IPOs. I believe next year will also be [the same],” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dennis Wu, CEO of Hong Kong-based Futu Securities, expected the current IPO boom to last till November and quieten a bit in December, before heating up again next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that Hong Kong is among the top IPO destinations in the world and is an open market with free capital flows. “As long as the issuers are good companies at reasonable valuations, you don't need worry about the market's holding capacity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said this unprecedented wave of IPOs has been fuelled by the rapid strides taken by Chinese tech firms in the past four to five years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the past few years, many of these firms have made great progress supported by financing from private equity funds. They have matured and reached the IPO stage,” said Bao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin Sha, an analyst at China Industrial Securities, said China's mobile phone penetration rate had surged to 54 per cent in 2017 from 41 per cent in 2014, fuelling a rapid growth in the start-ups offering products or services related to the mobile internet.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many of these start-ups have seen explosive growth, attracting enormous amounts of private capital amid hefty expectations about their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is similar to how many big internet portals rose in the early 2000s amid the internet revolution back then,” she wrote in a recent report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But this year, the Chinese private equity market, an important source of funds for start-ups, has tightened significantly.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the first six months, money raised by private equity funds and venture capital firms plunged 56 per cent year on year on the back of China's ongoing deleveraging efforts, weak domestic equity market, and a slowdown in economic growth complicated by the impact of the trade war with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/28/f21ac92c-c304-11e8-bfc4-8898d3e518ea_image_hires_183413.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It's really hard to access onshore money from private equity funds now,” said Ashley Li, head of asset management at Ping An Securities. “Many LPs [limited partners] have no additional capital to invest [in PE funds], and some even want to cash in on their existing investments.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronald Wan, chief executive at Hong Kong-based Partners Capital International, said a large number of PE funds set up in 2013 and 2014 have reached their harvesting phase.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A PE fund usually has an investment period of three to five years before it exits the portfolio companies. That has caused many PE funds to take the companies they back to go public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the companies themselves, it becomes imperative to find other sources of funding when uncertainties are on the rise.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Tech companies usually need constant blood transfusion in the early stages when they are yet to make a profit and need to keep burning money to support their expansion,” Wan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When winter comes in the current capital market cycle, the most important thing is to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Kai Fang, managing director and head of equity capital market at China Renaissance, said it is better for issuers to grab the window of opportunity sooner rather than later given the uncertainties, as long as the company meets the requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We don't know what will happen in the future. Maybe you can't sell [the IPO] at the highest price now, but the top priority is to get it done. No one can predict whether it will become better in the future. So why not now?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said there are several motives behind a company's desire to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“An IPO is so much more than just going public. It means a company can access more financing channels, boost its reputation and attract talent, and have a stronger bargaining position when talking to clients or even creditors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bruce Wu, co-head of </span><span class="s3">Citigroup</span><span class="s1">'s Greater China equity capital markets group, agreed it is important to grab the window as long as it's open.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The volatility may cause issuers to recalibrate their timing, but they will persist with their plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This unprecedented IPO wave has rekindled memories of what happened 18 years ago when the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> crashed after reaching a peak of 5,048 in March 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Starting in June 1999, amid the dotcom boom, the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> raised its benchmark rate six times within one year, from 4.75 per cent to 6.5 per cent in May 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Around that time, the US stock market embraced a concentrated IPO wave. 115 and 112 companies went public in 1999 and 2000 respectively, compared to the annual average of 72 between 1991 and 1996, according to data compiled by China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's four biggest internet portals at the time - China.com, Sina.com, NetEase and </span><span class="s3">Sohu.com</span><span class="s1"> - also listed on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> from July 1999 to July 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the bursting of the dotcom bubble in March 2000 hit IPOs hard. Not only did NetEase and Sohu have to briefly postpone their listing plans and cut fundraising targets, but also saw their shares drop quickly as the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> plummeted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> lost nearly 80 per cent of its value from its peak to a low of 1,114 in 2002, a period which many people call as the internet's nuclear winter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list itself is a success,” Wang Zhidong, founder and then CEO of Sina, said in an interview with Beijing Youth Daily in 2000. “We caught the last train. The window was closing.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Zhang, CEO of Sohu, was then quoted as saying that it was not as if the company would have died had it not listed. “But the IPO significantly increased our chances of survival.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2161035/xiaomis-share-surge-falls-victim-investor-worries-over-outlook]Eighteen years later, those comments resonate with Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Being able to list is a huge success for Xiaomi, given the volatility on the capital market,” Lei said in an open letter in July.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi raised US$4.7 billion in Hong Kong, the largest tech flotation of the year. But the fundraising value had to be cut by almost half from its initial target, as the company and banks became cautious amid a weak market and lacklustre investor interest. Its shares currently trade below its offer price, falling victim to worries over the outlook for Chinese tech firms and the US-China trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many analysts agreed that what is going on now bears some resemblance to the past in terms of the funding environment for tech companies.In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will surviveBao Fan, CEO and founder of China Renaissance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Although I don't think it will be as destructive as the bursting of the bubble back then, we need to be aware of a possible sharp turnaround in expectations for the new breed of tech and internet companies,” Wan from Partners Capital said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If a tech company mainly relies on burning cash to support its business without a viable business model, it easily dies when the environment becomes harsher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The end of the dotcom boom saw about 210 US internet companies go bankrupt because of the broken capital chain, as it was hard to access financing, according to data from China Industrial Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When the bubble in the tech sector burst in the 2000s, many companies experienced a painful transformation, as their valuations were reassessed,” said Lin from the Chinese securities firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Those that survived bear three key characteristics: cautious investments, cost control, and how fast the company can monetise its traffic and achieve earnings, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fan from China Renaissance holds similar views, as he sees the ability to manage cash flows important to the survival of a tech company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“In the end, the great wave will wash away the weak, and only the fittest ones will survive.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong medical services company </span><span class="s3">C-Mer Eye Care Holdings</span><span class="s1"> opened 82 per cent higher on its trading debut on Monday, pointing to the possibility of a positive environment for initial public offerings that may be planned for the city this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in the company, which operates eye clinics, opened at HK$5.35, above its IPO price of HK$2.90 and the marketed range of HK$2.35 to HK$2.90. It was trading at HK$5.16 by mid-morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">C-Mer, which counts Tencent Holdings chairman Pony Ma as a cornerstone investor, is raising a net HK$521.3 million (US$66.6 million). The retail share offer was increased to 98.5 million shares from 19.7 million under the exchange's clawback rule, which allows shares to be reallocated to retail investors if demand exceeds the original allocation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO was oversubscribed by more than 1,500 times, locking up about HK$89.9 billion of funds. The proceeds will go to establishing three new eye hospitals in China as well to the possible acquisition of existing eye hospitals in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The surge in C-Mer's stock came as Hong Kong's benchmark stock index rose above its historical closing record price of 31,638.23 set on October 30, 2007, though it was still shy of the intraday record high of 31,958.41 set on the same day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said optimism in Hong Kong's markets was rising after the founder of the world's largest e-commerce shopping platform, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, said he would consider listing its shares on the local bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That comment followed the announcement of a plan to change Hong Kong's listing rules to attract more companies, particularly those with dual-class share structures. The exchange's previous rule to bar companies with such structures was the reason Alibaba had originally rejected Hong Kong for its listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The changes are likely to kick in by mid 2018, attracting more well-known Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, </span><span class="s3">OCBC Bank</span><span class="s1"> said in a research note. This new wave of IPOs is likely to suck in more funds and push up Hong Kong dollar interest rates this year, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Other recent new listings in Hong Kong did not fare so well on Monday. </span><span class="s3">Yixin Group</span><span class="s1">, an online car-loan provider backed by Tencent, fell 0.9 per cent to HK$6.75, and has been trading below its IPO price since November.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Computer game accessories maker </span><span class="s3">Razer Inc</span><span class="s1"> fell 0.8 per cent to HK$3.88, similar to its IPO price in November.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) reported a 49 per cent rise in profit for the first quarter, thanks to higher turnover and more new listings, sending its shares up as much as 2 per cent on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX, which has just completed its largest listing reforms in three decades in a bid to attract more companies, posted net profit of HK$2.56 billion (US$326.12 million) for the first quarter, up from HK$1.72 billion in the same period a year ago and a record for a single quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The results beat expectations of a net profit of HK$2.31 billion in a poll of analysts by </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">. Earnings per share is HK$2.07.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has revamped its listing rules to try and make itself more attractive as a listing destination, particularly for big technology firms, which will now be allowed to list if they have dual-class share structures. However some analysts cautioned that the outlook for the bourse may not be so rosy in the current three months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Turnover and new listings were high in the first quarter,” saidChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services industry, who is also a stockbroker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the outlook for the second quarter may not be so optimistic. Turnover has gone down recently as markets globally are volatile, while the number of applications under the new listing regime is slower than expected. These factors would affect the result of the HKEX in the second quarter,” Cheung said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">'s new listing rules draw just two applications, far fewer than expected[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2145145/hong-kongs-new-listing-rules-draw-just-tickle-applications-far]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX shares rose as much as 2 per cent in the afternoon session after the release of its earnings, before closing at HK$257, up 0.31 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">First-quarter profit was the highest for a single quarter at HKEX since its establishment in 2000, and was lifted by a 96 per cent rise in trading fee income to HK$676 million from improved turnover. Average daily turnover stood at HK$146 billion during the first three months this year, up 97 per cent from HK$74.3 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 10 per cent in January to reach a record high of 33,484 points on January 29, before falling back in the following two months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fees meanwhile rose by a total of HK$28 million, with a HK$16 million increase inannual listing fees from a higher number of listed companies and a HK$12 million increasein initial listing fees due to more IPOs. There were 69 new listings on the main board and the GEM second board for growth firms in the first quarter, up from 40 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">a&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A jump in revenue from the two Stock Connect schemes that link the Hong Kong bourse with its Shanghai and Shenzhen counterparts to facilitate two-way trading also helped the HKEX in the first quarter. The schemes brought in combined revenue at HK$172 million, more than double the HK$75 million in the same period last year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor, the first technology unicorn landing on Hong Kong's market this year, rose on its trading debut on Friday, after its US$1.12 billion initial public offering received a retail oversubscription of 653 times, becoming the most sought after main listing since 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Good Doctor, formally known as </span><span class="s3">Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company</span><span class="s1">, advanced as much as 7 per cent to HK$58.7 in mid-morning action. It was quoted at HK$55.6 by noon, about 1.5 per cent higher than its IPO price of HK$54.8.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bullish price action bucked the overall weaker market trend, as the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.4 per cent by the mid-session close.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At its current price, the online medical and health care service platform had a market value of HK$60 billion (US$7.64 billion), versus rival </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Health Information Technology</span><span class="s1">'s value of HK$40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor saw turnover of HK$2.8 billion so far, with 49 million shares changed hands, ranking as the second most heavily traded stock on the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spin-off of </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> Group, Good Doctor is currently China's largest online health care and medical platform by user numbers. At the end of 2017, it had 193 million registrants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the company is not profitable yet. In 2017 the company reported a loss of 1 billion yuan, its third straight year of losses.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Wang Tao, chairman and chief executive for Good Doctor, said he is confident the firm can generate solid revenues and turn profitable in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The company is still in the early development phase of obtaining users and traffic,” Wang said Friday at the listing ceremony in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We want to build a one-stop online medical and health care platform and need to boost traffic and change user behaviour at the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Good Doctor prices US$1.12 billion IPO at top end amid retail frenzy[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2143745/ping-good-doctor-prices-us112-billion-ipo-top-end-amid-retail]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking ahead, Wang said the company will use the IPO proceeds to expand its user base and focus on growing its consumer health care and family doctor services.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor had priced its IPO at the top end of the HK$50.80 to HK$54.80 range. The capital raising was the biggest in value this year, with the retail portion attracting share subscriptions 653 times greater than the shares on offer. The oversubscription rate exceeded the investor enthusiasm for China Literature, which was oversubscribed by 625 times during its November debut in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Good Doctor's international tranche was also “massively” oversubscribed, according to sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing, which has drained liquidity from Hong Kong's banking system, could ignite investor enthusiasm and become a catalyst for a pipeline of blockbuster new-economy IPOs this year, analysts said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing rules, which permit dual-class share listings by technology companies as well as biotech companies that have yet to show a profit, will draw a flurry of listing applications from young companies, said Edmond Hui, chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Bright Smart Securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Earlier this week, Xiaomi, one of China's largest smartphone makers, filed for an IPO in Hong Kong in what could become the world's biggest stock flotation since Alibaba's US$25 billion debut in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think we are going to see a hot IPO market in the next few months, with a number of tech unicorns coming to Hong Kong after Xiaomi,” said Hui.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">According to Good Doctor's prospectus, around 40 per cent of the proceeds raised will be used for business expansion, such as its e-commerce business, hiring sales and medical professionals, acquiring new users and funding marketing activities.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> would cut the number of partners the firm has and bind them to a three-year share sale ban if Hong Kong regulators accept a controversial management structure that is blocking its potential HK$100 billion initial public offering, a source close to the listing authorities told the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal had been floated to the stock exchange's listing committee ahead of a regular meeting tomorrow, but no formal listing application had yet been submitted, the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is aimed at showing that Alibaba is willing to make concessions," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another source close to the Securities and Futures Commission said such a concession was unlikely to be enough to persuade the authorities to accept the Alibaba structure. "Alibaba will still not give up its demand to nominate the majority of board directors, which still gives more power to certain shareholders than others. That is unacceptable to the SFC," the source said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Share lock-ups for executives are not uncommon in initial public offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba had no comment, but a source close to the company said talks were continuing and constructive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The e-commerce giant's planned listing is in limbo over its management's determination to maintain a partnership structure that regulators worry gives top executives more rights than ordinary shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sources close to Alibaba insist the firm does not want a dual share structure or a change to rules. Instead, it is seeking an exemption under an existing rule that is part of the Hong Kong listing code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma Yun revealed fresh details about the partnership scheme earlier this month that analysts saw as being designed to soothe concerns. The scheme started in 2010 and had elected 28 partners over a three-round selection process following strict eligibility criteria.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ma and his top executives own about 10 per cent of the company, compared with about 24 per cent owned by United States internet firm </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and about 37 per cent by Japan's </span><span class="s3">SoftBank</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investment bankers who have met Ma have told him that a New York listing would be his best bet for securing the control he craves.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the New York Stock Exchange and its smaller rival, Nasdaq, are lobbying Alibaba to list in the US where a dual-class share structure is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial experts say, however, that Alibaba has missed its window to sell shares in New York this year and it may have only until the end of this month before the same happens in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any later and the application would be subject to new rules that come into effect on October 1, obliging firms to allow at least two months between the date of a sponsor's formal appointment and a listing application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said after the first anniversary ceremony of its joint venture with the two mainland stock exchanges yesterday that the city's listing rules were working well and there was no reason to change them to accommodate dual share structures, in the latest sign that the regulatory stand-off remains unresolved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked about the status of the potential listing of Alibaba, Li reiterated that Hong Kong's listing regime was designed to protect all shareholders equally, underscoring the reservations that the regulators have about the company's structure.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As Alibaba, China's e-commerce giant, made its monumental debut with a 38 per cent jump in value on its first day of trading on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on Friday, it is hard not to be awed by the enormous wealth its chairman, Jack Ma Yun, has created for himself, his employees and investors - the focus of intensive media frenzy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded by the former English teacher in his Hangzhou flat 15 years ago, the company raised US$21.8 billion in one of the largest initial public offerings the world has seen, valuing the company at US$231 billion, surpassing </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and Amazon and becoming the world's second largest internet company after </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Based on Friday's closing price of US$93.89, Ma's remaining stake of 7.8 per cent was worth more than US$18 billion, easily making him the mainland's richest man and among the wealthiest in Asia. As fireworks went off at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou to celebrate the listing, it has also made many of its young employees US dollar millionaires.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But wealth creation is only one of many far-reaching implications of the Alibaba IPO as foreign investors bet on the company as the latest vehicle to tap China's explosive growth of e-commerce and internet use despite the concerns over the firm's management structure and government interference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing has firmly placed Alibaba, which until now was not well known outside China, on the global stage for future expansion in overseas markets, even though Ma said the company would continue to focus on the market at home.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">More importantly, it also reflects the rise of a new wave of technology giants to propel the Chinese economy forward as the government seeks greater reliance on innovation and domestic consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the latest e-commerce giant to gain attention abroad following the rise of Lenovo, the world's largest maker of personal computers; Baidu, China's largest search engine company; </span><span class="s3">Huawei Technologies</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest maker of networking equipment; and Tencent, owner of the popular </span><span class="s3">WeChat</span><span class="s1"> messaging service.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another important feature one can't fail to notice is that all these tech giants are privately owned in an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises with monopolies or cartels in banking, energy, telecoms and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Entrepreneurs like Alibaba's Ma, Tencent's Pony Ma and Robin Li of Baidu reflect the fact that the private sector is not only a jobs creator, but contributes more than 60 per cent to China's overall economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba's trading platforms have helped create millions of jobs on the mainland as self-employed entrepreneurs set up online shops to tap a user base of several hundred million people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same time, Alibaba's blockbuster success is set to trigger deep soul-searching for mainland regulators and investors alike.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Most Chinese tech giants have sought their primary listings in New York, except Tencent and Lenovo, which listed in Hong Kong. Regulatory hurdles and the low-risk appetite of investors on the mainland have driven the best tech firms away from its stock markets, depriving small investors of the chance to buy into those high-growth companies directly even though they contribute to the bulk of their profits as users and consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Indeed, Hong Kong was the preferred choice for Alibaba's IPO but it was forced to choose New York because Hong Kong does not offer dual-class share structures - a move local regulators are now reviewing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact that foreign investors are the biggest winners from Alibaba's IPO has also shown that China still has a long way to go in building up its own venture capital markets and financing its own hi-tech development and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is true that the sovereign fund </span><span class="s3">China Investment Corporation</span><span class="s1"> and several private investment firms linked to relatives of former government leaders will reap generous payouts from Alibaba's listing, but their stakes in the company are tiny compared to those of </span><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and Japan's </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1">, which earned much more as the firm's biggest shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Yahoo</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Softbank</span><span class="s1"> placed their faith in Ma by investing in Alibaba in its early days at a time when he was spurned by investors at home and abroad.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council proposed yesterday the creation of several new listing boards, including one specialising in companies with unique shareholding structures, in a widely anticipated report which came after the city lost the mega initial public coffering of e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> to New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We recommend that Hong Kong's policymakers, stock exchange and regulators should conduct an overall review on how to change our regulation and market structure to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness to capture companies to have their IPOs here," said Bonnie Chan, the policy research committee member of the council, the government's highest level financial services advisory group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By introducing specialised listing boards, Chan said it would "enable better matching between different types of issuers and investors" and "accommodate innovations in shareholding and management structure". This would help Hong Kong to develop as a hub for firms in specific industries such as mining and natural resources, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A board recognising special shareholder structures would be welcomed by the likes of Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> which all have unique shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laurence Li, convenor of the council's policy research committee, denied the changes are aimed at being tailor-made for any individual firm.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"After the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock through train scheme is implemented later this year, it will attract more companies to list here. We need to make sure our markets are ready for that," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba was in talks last October with </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> to list with a share structure that would allow its founders and top management to nominate most board members despite holding a minority stake. The exchange refused to grant an exemption because the Securities and Futures Commission felt such a structure would be in violation of the one-share-one-vote principle, prompting Alibaba to decide last March to list in the US, where dual class share structures are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The council proposed that Hong Kong follow London's lead with several markets catering to different companies and investors, including premium and standard boards for companies wanting different regulations. It also has different boards called the alternative, professional or specialist markets which appeal to different investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also looked at how to shorten the IPO period, the requirement of cornerstone investors and the mechanism to allocate shares between institutional and retail investors.</span></p>
