<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore's stock exchange plans to have weighted voting rights on its main board, while the Hong Kong government said it is inclined to introduced such an arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A weighted voting rights structure is contrary to the traditional one-share, one-vote scheme that gives every shareholder voting rights proportionate to his or her holdings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is no need to set up a new board if the main board could accommodate companies practicing the weighted voting rights structure, said </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A standing point has been reached for the structure between the local bourse and financial regulators, and more discussions are needed with the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> , Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that because HKEx counted in the possibility that rules of the main board might not be able to change for "one share different voting rights," it had the new board initiative proposed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Singapore exchange said it has already allowed weighted voting rights practicing firms to have a second listing, and might allow initial flotation in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There are now about 150 mainland and Hong Kong companies listed in Singapore, but this will not bring in direct competition between the SAR and Lion City because of the different positioning strategies adopted.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx intends to serve mainland enterprise, while 40 percent of stocks traded in Singapore belong to foreign firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) will today announce the consultation results of locally listed companies adopting weighted voting rights in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The briefing will be attended by David Graham, chief regulatory officer and head of listing of the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEx called on responses for its concept paper on weighted voting rights, also referred to as dual-class share structure, in August last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The shareholding structure is contrary to Hong Kong's current adoption of the ``one-share, one- vote'' standard, meaning a shareholder's right to vote is proportional to his shareholding size.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, the weighted voting rights suggest that shares can be classified one class-carrying, one vote per share and another class- carrying, multiple votes per share.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The idea was sought by Alibaba as a precondition for listing in Hong Kong in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It later listed on the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> under such a shareholding structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse has stressed it holds no view for or against the weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia yesterday said the consultation result of volatile control mechanism and closing auction session will be released early next month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He confirmed that the HKEx board of directors has approved the two mechanisms, which are likely to be launched in the second half next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial regulators are inclined to have weighted voting rights practiced in the local stock market's main board, and setting up a new board is not urgent for now, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A weighted voting rights structure is contrary to the traditional one-share, one- vote scheme which gives every shareholder voting rights proportional to his or her holding.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Practicing this structure is possible and it can be achieved by simply adding a new chapter in the listing rules for the main board, Chan said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, rights of investors should be well protected and this will require follow-up plans from the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> and the local stock exchange, added Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">James Lau Yee-cheung, secretary for financial services and the treasury, said the proposal is likely to be brought to the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the government will discuss listing requirements for pre-revenue companies, those which have not yet recorded any profit. A revised consultation paper is expected to be released after relevant authorities reach an agreement. Technology giant Alibaba failed to get listed in Hong Kong and listed instead on the New York bourse in 2014 because of the SFC's refusal to allow the firm to use a weighted voting rights scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government rejected the stock exchange's proposal on the scheme in 2015, saying it would not provide adequate protection to investors. Lau also said that Hong Kong welcomes initial coin offerings amid changing trends in financial technology and in line with the government's bid to further strengthen the SAR's position as a financial services center.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, regulations are necessary if firms engaged in coin offerings are engaged in raising funds. Investor protection is also essential, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government has been promoting the development of trade finance and digital currency through the development of blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A fast payment system will be launched next year, and it is expected to be more convenient than systems now in place in the mainland, Lau said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">E-payment in the mainland is currently dominated by Tencent's Wechat Pay and Alipay of Alibaba. Customers can use these two payment systems almost everywhere.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The introduction of dual-class technology stock listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely to</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">narrow the valuation gap between Chinese and US technology stocks listed in the United States, says the chief executive of exchange-traded fund manager Enhanced Investment Products.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tobias Bland said that thanks to the impending launch of the weighted voting right governance structure by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, he expected several Chinese technology “marquee players” - smartphone giant Xiaomi as well as leading fintech players Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> - and Ping An Good Doctor to list with Hong Kong as their primary market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights will also lead to dual listings in Hong Kong by technology companies that are already listed in the US as American depositary receipts, he said. Together, the growing number of technology stocks in Hong Kong will mean that the price-to-earnings multiples of Chinese technology American depositary receipts - and their respective share prices - would be due for an upgrade, said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The weighted voting rights structure, which is still not allowed by Chinese regulators, will also incentivise more Chinese technology companies to list in Hong Kong, industry players have long said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we look at Chinese American depositary receipts that make up our exchange-traded funds portfolio, last year they had a 70 per cent run on average in their share prices based purely on their revenue growth, which is about 40-50 per cent on average per year. Yet, they are trading at an average 28-29 times the 2018 expected earnings, which is a big gap compared with the 35 times average of US internet stocks,” said Bland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">American depositary receipts are the US dollar-denominated shares of a non-US company. Created by depositary banks, these represent one or several underlying shares from the company's local stock market, and are interchangeable with the underlying stocks.Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuationsJerry Peng, China equity strategist, Citi</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors seeking to profit from price level differences between underlying stocks and their US-listed counterparts often create or cancel American depositary receipts through depositary banks. In such arbitrage trading strategies, investors target to profit by selling American depositary receipts trading at a premium to the underlying stock, and buying the underlying stock, or vice versa. Hence, arbitrageurs help to narrow out the price differentials that could exist across the two markets, enabling their prices to often track each other closely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Bland said, the good news for holders of American depositary receipts - such as those of </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1">, NetEase, Ctrip, Baidu, Alibaba - is that they can expect to see their price-to-earnings multiples getting re-rated by investors in the US market. Tencent, for example, is trading at forward multiples of more than 40 times, and that could be a level that the earnings multiples of other American depositary receipts could match as well.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“At the moment, their American depositary receipts performance is often hurt by a general scepticism among US investors about Chinese names,” he said. Contrarily, investors in China and Hong Kong have better understanding of their businesses as frequent users of their services, and such understanding will support Hong Kong-listed technology stocks' performance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jerry Peng, China equity strategist at Citi, however, said that while he did not rule out that American depositary receipts might be boosted by strong investor sentiment around more Chinese technology stocks listing in Hong Kong, any such benefits are likely to be short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Offshore investors still look at fundamentals. Initially, there might be strong positive sentiment after the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, but eventually the share prices will come back to reasonable valuations,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Peng said investors who trade American depositary receipts and Hong Kong stocks will still look at the American depositary receipt levels as reference for valuations, as many leading technology focused investors are still based in the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Most of these American depositary receipt investors trade global technology stocks, including those listed in Korea, Taiwan and China … they already know a lot about these companies. Hence, in terms of knowledge of the issuers they are not significantly disadvantaged to Hong Kong investors,” said Peng.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX is expected to launch a formal consultation on the proposed amendments to listing rules that will pave the way for the launch of weighted voting rights during the first quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``HKEx's listing committee is the second boss, while the SFC is the big boss ... The big boss sets the rules, and we the staff follow, in line with procedure.'' Li said yesterday.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka- shing said last week that he is neutral on companies' secondary listing in a dual- class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal by HKEx after a year- long consultation followed a decision by mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group</span><span class="s1"> to list in New York to raise a record US$25 billion (HK$195 billion) as local rules only allow firms in a ``one-share, one-vote'' structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also stressed that HKEx holds a neutral stance in the discussion.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong only needs one board and one regulator, and it has no need for a new board for listing stocks, a stock analyst said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We favor a single board, under a single statutory regulator [the SFC], combining listing and takeover regulations, and not the four-board mess that the HKEx [</span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">] advocates," independent stock analyst David Webb said in a published article yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said setting up a new board will not completely resolve the problems caused by the so-called "weighted voting rights" - which refers to either listing second-class shares with reduced or no voting rights, or listing only one class of shares but which entrenches management rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) proposed, in a concept paper that it issued in June this year, the setting up of a new board for firms with share structures of the same shareholdings but with different rights to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Buying that kind of shares is inevitable, said Webb, adding that if more and more assets are held via weighted voting rights, professionals who manage the public's money will have little choice but to own shares with weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that "with so many scam stocks and corporate governance problems among Hong Kong-listed mainland companies," the last thing that Hong Kong needs is to "weaken investor rights further."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesperson of HKEX said: "We have huge reservations about allowing corporate WVR beneficiaries as this is seen as a major attempt to further dilute the principle of one share, one vote."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both the initial change and its extension have been controversial topics in Hong Kong with some critics arguing that by undermining the principle of "one share, one vote" they privilege certain shareholders over others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said they will bar investor access to Hong Kong-listed companies with WVR structures, citing the complexity of the holdings. The three bourses later agreed to set up a working group to address the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ownership of WVR shares has so far been limited to company founders. Under current rules, WVR shares lose their additional rights if the founder ceases to be a director of the company, or transfers the shares to another person. The HKEX had said it planned to launch a separate consultation by July 31 to consider extending weighted rights to companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But yesterday it said it needed to discuss the matter further with stakeholders to develop a broader consensus.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asia Corporate Governance Association, said the safeguards the exchange had brought in to protect investors after the rule change were weak and hard to enforce.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Extending WVRs to corporates would mean WVR in perpetuity," he said at a press conference.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Internet giant Tencent is seeking to list its online music unit in the United States in part because weighted voting rights extend to companies there.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) scrapped plans to introduce the dual-class shares draft proposal following rejection from the Securities and Futures Commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse listing committee will not finalize the draft proposal on weighted voting rights, which allows companies to issue shares with differing voting rights, nor proceed with a formal consultation, it said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx had proposed to loosen the current ``one-share-one-vote'' restrictions for certain companies with specific safeguards in June after a public consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But a week later, the securities market watchdog formally opposed such change, as it can potentially erode the rights of minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``Whilst the listing committee continues to believe that this is an important topic for Hong Kong and one that deserved the full attention of the Hong Kong market, it does not believe that progress can be made, currently,'' HKEx said. But the matter will be kept under review, it added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia responded shortly after the SFC opposition, saying that ``The SFC is the big boss [it] sets the rules, and we the staff follow, in line with procedure.'' SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said he respects the HKEx decision, and does not believe it will affect companies seeking to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Financial innovation and weighted voting rights are not related, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Webb, a corporate governance activist, said on his website the original HKEx proposal ``exposed the blatant conflict of interests in the exchange being a for-profit regulator.''</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse has worked on the weighted voting rights issue for some two years, it said. It has explored ways to change the listing rules since Alibaba chose to list in New York for its US$25 billion (HK$195 billion) initial public offering in September last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba insisted the listed entity be allowed to be controlled by a handful of its founders who did not hold a majority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong was second in global IPO rankings last year behind New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, recognising the competitive pressures the city faces in attracting listings by new economy companies, has thrown its weight behind the Hong Kong stock exchange's proposed listing reform that will allow companies with multiple classes of shares to list here, its chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This confirmed a South China Morning Post report on the regulator's support for a change that will hopefully attract big mainland players such as Lufax and </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial Holdings</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is a competition issue. It is not just the US - the UK and Singapore also want to attract technology and new economy companies to list. Hong Kong needs to play catch up,” Tong said in a media briefing on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He hoped at least one giant tech company would list here under the new rules by October 2018, when he retires after a six-year stint with the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong, while the tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu would consider secondary listings here after the new rule changes for dual-class share companies are introduced next year,” said Tong.“I hope that mainland tech companies would no longer see the need for them to list in the US, as they will be able to list in Hong Kong.”Carlson Tong Ka-shing, chairman, Securities and Futures Commission</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This follows the rejection in 2014 of a plan by e-commerce giant Alibaba to adopt a structure that would allow its founder, Jack Ma Yun, and key executives to appoint more than half of the company's board. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, eventually listed in New York, which allows dual-class share structures while Hong Kong has banned these since the mid-1980s. </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange in 2015 proposed to allow these companies to list but the proposal was scrapped following objections by the commission.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, stock exchange operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> unveiled a proposal to allow giant technology companies with at least HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) to list with multiple classes of shares, and biotech companies with no revenue to list in Hong Kong after a rule change by mid next year. This time, Tong indicated his support but stressed that proper investor protection measures must be in place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Let us be clear, we still believe that ‘one-share, one-vote' is the gold standard since it has never been proven that companies with weighted voting rights perform better in the long run. We do accept, however, that to attract new economy companies to list in Hong Kong and to make our market more vibrant, we need to change,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The challenge that Hong Kong faces is one of competition, which is fully supported by market statistics, he said. About 50 per cent of the mainland technology companies listed in the United States have multiple-class shareholding structures, versus only 17 per cent for non-mainland technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With IPO rules reboot, Hong Kong is primed for 2018's big China technology listings[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2124909/ipo-rules-reboot-hong-kong-primed-2018s-big-china-technology]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the other hand, only 8 per cent of mainland non-technology companies listed in the US have multiple-class shareholding structures, about the same level as non-mainland non-technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This suggests that mainland technology companies prefer weighted voting rights structures and if Hong Kong wants to attract these companies to list in its market, we have to find a way to accommodate those that we consider to be of substance and quality,” he said, adding that the commission will work closely with HKEX on safeguards.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong also said one of the reasons for the commission's objection in 2015 was that due to large fund houses worries about these companies would be added to the benchmark index and, as such, passive fund managers would be forced to invest in them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Recently, both FTSE Russell and S&amp;P have decided to place restrictions on the admission of companies with weighted voting rights in their indices, although MSCI has decided to carry out further consultation,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, some large fund houses such as Black Rock rejected the idea of index providers restricting weighted voting rights companies from their index as they believe the fund houses should have the right to choose what companies to invest in.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They would rather see protective measures such as sunset clauses. Clearly, there has been a slow shift of mindset … accepting some form of weighted voting rights companies.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With regard to the commission and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption</span><span class="s1"> (ICAC) joining hands to raid the offices of financial company Convoy Global, Tong declined to comment on the case but confirmed the commission would, where necessary, continue to collaborate with other regulators and enforcement agencies such as ICAC, Hong Kong Police and mainland regulator </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> in combating financial crimes to maintain market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong said investors should be aware of market uncertainties in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Going into 2018, the capital market may face many uncertainties, including Brexit, geopolitical risks in North Korea and the Middle East, and the US interest rate rises,” said Tong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US stock market may adjust itself and if it happens, it will affect the rest of the world, including Hong Kong, which has recorded substantial gains over the year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I would therefore like to remind investors that they need to be very cautious and prudent in making their investment decisions and to not take excessive risks.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange operator has scrapped a planned consultation to expand listing reforms that would allow corporate investors to own stakes in companies that have a so-called dual-class shares structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision is a further setback for the sweeping reforms, which have so far failed to generate the much hoped-for slew of applications from big technology firms eager to raise capital on the city's bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange introduced new rules in April to allow companies with dual-class shareholding rights, or weighted voting rights, to list here. The reform allows individual founders or certain key executives of these companies to own shares that carry more voting rights than those of other shareholders. The move was aimed at attracting more technology companies, which tend to favour this structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) had said initially it would launch a separate consultation by July 31 on whether it should also allow companies to own the special voting-class shares. The bourse, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that this consultation would not be launched after all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said: “Given that the current weighted voting-rights regime has only recently been put in place, the exchange believes it should deliberate further the extended weighted voting-rights regime and should continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to develop a broader consensus on the subject matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Accordingly, the exchange has decided not to launch a corporate weighted voting-rights consultation at this time as initially planned. The exchange will update the market on the subject in due course.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief expects more IPOs under Hong Kong's new listing regime after summer break[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2146645/hkex-chief-expects-more-ipos-under-hong-kongs-new-listing]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It marks another setback for the biggest overhaul of the local bourse's listing rules in 25 years, which was carried out amid high hopes that it would attract technology giants with dual-class shares as well as biotech firms that are yet to generate revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Almost three months on, only two companies with the dual-class shareholding structure - smartphone maker Xiaomi and online food-delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> - have applied for listing. Hangzhou-based </span><span class="s3">Ascletis Pharma</span><span class="s1">, which is close to commercialising a new drug to treat Hepatitis C in mainland China, is the only pre-revenue biotechnology company to apply for a listing, and is set to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This is somewhat disappointing,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector. “We would like to see the HKEX continue its listing reform to accept diversified companies to list, including those with different shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, it may be a good move to slow down the pace to allow more parties to discuss further on the reform.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">With Xiaomi's recent IPO not living up to its expectations of raising US$10 billion and some Chinese tech firms opting to float their shares in the US and Shanghai, Hong Kong could only maintain its No 3 global IPO ranking in the first half, unchanged from a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong retail investors give Xiaomi's IPO the cold shoulder, put off by high financing cost and valuation</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced earlier this month they would not allow dual-class shareholding companies listed in Hong Kong to be traded by mainlanders via the stock connect schemes, a further blow to the effectiveness of the listing reforms. HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiao-jia flew to Beijing last week to negotiate, and the three bourses agreed to look at when dual-class companies might be allowed to trade via the stock connect.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, supported the HKEX decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The dual-class shareholding listing reform was only launched three months ago. The market participants and investors still need time to digest the reform. It would be too soon to launch another consultation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX would be better off focusing on working with the mainland regulators to sort out the issue of mainlanders being able to trade the dual-class shares via the stock connect. That would be more important than making further changes to the listing reform.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen to educate mainland investors about shares with weighted voting rights, such as those of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX announced a “special stability trading period” and said since mainland investors were not familiar with companies that employed such shareholding structures, there was a “need to consider the maturity and regulatory practices of the two markets when including weighted voting rights companies” in the list of securities eligible for trade through the Stock Connect schemes linking the bourse in Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A joint working group will be set up to form the rules for including weighted voting rights companies as soon as possible, said the bourse operator. “Details of the special stability trading period are to be worked out by the joint working group and will be announced in due course,” said a HKEX spokeswoman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi will not be traded through the Stock Connects until the working group has worked out all the details, but that did not stop its stock from rising in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Shares in the world's fourth-largest smartphone company plummeted this week after China temporarily halted trade in its shares by mainland investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its shares rose to HK$22.2 as markets opened, bouncing back from a 9.6 per cent tumble at the beginning of the week. The stock is now just above the HK$22 mark that Xiaomi was seeking during its flotation last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a statement over the weekend, the exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen put a temporary halt on mainland investors buying and selling Xiaomi's Hong Kong-listed shares under the Stock Connect schemes. The curb came as part of a wider ban on certain securities, in what has been viewed as a race between the exchanges to be Asia's fundraising hub for technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares in HKEX, which closed last week at HK$234, dipped on Monday following the announcement, opening at HK$236 and closing the day down by 0.17 per cent at HK$233.8. They fell by another 0.77 per cent to HK$232 on Tuesday. But on Wednesday, its stock rose by as much as 1.5 per cent to HK$235.40, and was at HK$234 at 11am, an increase of 1.1 per cent, or 2.6 points.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Afternoon trading once saw the index surge 236 points to 31,081 after dropping to as low as 30,453 in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unlike past years, the sharp correction in Hong Kong stocks has not drawn swarms of mainland bargain hunters, suggesting to some market watchers that a sharper slide may be coming.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US policy tightening would reduce liquidity in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">ANZ said factors shaping the Hong Kong dollar this year include the HIBOR-LIBOR spread, which widened after the </span><span class="s3">US Federal Reserve</span><span class="s1"> ended the zero rate regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is expected that the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span><span class="s1"> will issue more and lower aggregate balance to influence the Hong Kong interbank offered rate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, higher fluctuation of the yuan is expected this year and will depend heavily on the US dollar and the international market, said Raymond Yeung, ANZ's chief economist, Greater China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's securities regulator said yesterday the number of inquiries into market manipulation and insider trading, as well as corporate governance and disclosure issues, has doubled over the past five years, making it necessary to change listing rules in the Asian financial hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Speaking at the Thomson Reuters Pan-Asian Regulatory Summit in Hong Kong, Ashley Alder, pictured, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission, said it was too early to predict what the final listings reform will look like. He disputed claims from critics that changes would "stunt" the local equities market. The overhaul of listing rules in June could curb the regulatory powers of the stock exchange and hand more authority to the SFC.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the SFC said new rules would speed up decision-making for new listings, the proposed changes pitted international asset managers and The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, a body that represents locally listed companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is all about a more efficient, accountable and transparent process," Alder said. He highlighted growing concerns over the poor quality of firms on the Growth Enterprise Market, some of which had seen huge price spikes immediately after listing. He said these developments made efforts to ensure the local market is fit for purpose all the more urgent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It's very hard for me to imagine why any market regulator would be motivated to pursue policies which could stunt the healthy development of the financial centre for which it's responsible," Alder said. He also left the door open for consideration of weighted voting rights for stock listings in SAR - as opposed to its long established 'one share, one vote' principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The subject was a hot topic that surrounded Chinese e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> move to opt for a US$25 billion listing two years ago in New York, not Hong Kong. Alder said the regulator had never decided weighted voting rights were impossible for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2014 Alibaba wanted to go public in SAR with a shareholding structure that gave company insiders control even though they didn't hold a majority of shares, breaching the 'one share, one vote' principle.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma said last week that outdated rules in Hong Kong could hurt the appeal of the city to new economy companies looking to list in Hong Kong, and that a local site for an initial public offering of shares in Alibaba's finance affiliate </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> was not a foregone conclusion.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors started trading Xiaomi's shares in the grey market yesterday at a price of HK$16.15, 5 percent lower than the potential offer price of HK$17, according to market sources.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese smartphone maker, which is the first company with weighted voting rights to list in Hong Kong, is expected to price its shares at HK$17, the lower limit of the indicative price range of between HK$17 to HK$22, since the response to its IPO was not as good as other newly-listed new economy companies such as Ping An Good Doctor (1833).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's retail tranche was oversubscribed a mere 8 times. Investors who subscribed for nine board lots of its shares will successfully get two lots. Retail investors could trade Xiaomi's shares in the grey market on Friday after the market closed. The debut day is set for July 9.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Hong Kong is expected to once again become the world's largest IPO market in 2018, raising between HK$200 billion and HK$250 billion, according to a PwC report, which added that the new weighted voting rights structure and biotech listing rules may attract more companies to seek listings in the SAR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total IPO funds raised in the first half of 2018 was HK$50.4 billion, an eight percent decline compared to the same period a year before, while the number of newly listed companies in Hong Kong reached 108 in the first half of this year, up 50 percent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Excluding companies that raised funds of more than HK$10 billion, the average deal size for the first half year is at HK$1 billion, representing a 10 percent year on year decrease.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Benson Wong, entrepreneur group leader of PwC Hong Kong, said for the next half of the year, several unicorns will flock to Hong Kong since they need to expand their business as they become more and more mature.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, some companies from Europe and America will also make their debuts in the SAR. He said </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) is currently busy with around 200 IPO deals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked about the Chinese depository receipts, Wong said: "We are in support of CDRs but the specific details of CDRs still need time to settle down." Wong expected the first CDRs would be carried out within the next six months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other IPO action, </span><span class="s3">Anchorstone Holdings</span><span class="s1"> (1592), which will go public today, closed 10 percent lower than its IPO price in the grey market yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, </span><span class="s3">Tong Kee (Holding) (</span><span class="s1">8305) rose 10 percent in the grey market yesterday. It will also start trading its shares today.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Outgoing Securities and Futures Commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said implementation of a real-name registration system can effectively combat market misconduct.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Full disclosure would help surveillance of the market. When traders realize the SFC and the market know who are trading certain stocks, they will behave better," Tong told local media.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tong has been a practicing accountant for 30 years, followed by six more as a regulator. Throughout his career, he said he has seen a fair share of high-profile corporate failings, both in Hong Kong and overseas. His six-year term as SFC chairman ends this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Looking back 10 years ago to </span><span class="s3">Lehman Brothers</span><span class="s1"> and AIG in the global financial crisis, which provided hard lessons in corporate governance, Tong said the market has been much more stable in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">During his tenure, the public generally viewed the most controversial issue he handled was whether to allow the listing of firms with weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, the SFC objected to the draft proposal by the Hong Kong stock exchange to accept primary listings with weighted voting rights structures. But it later changed its stance toward supporting the controversial dual-class listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba ended up listing in New York, as the United States allowed dual-class listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I have no regrets that Alibaba did not list in Hong Kong because the listing rules at that time did not allow it," Tong said, adding, "it was not appropriate to grant an exemption just because the company was big."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Prior to joining SFC, Tong was involved in regulatory work of the securities and futures markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has submitted a proposal to the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">, calling for the establishment of a new board and a review of the Growth Enterprise Market, according to a local media report.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board should have different categories of companies and each segment should be open only to the appropriate type of investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For instance, start-up companies will only be open to professional investors as they offer higher risks Start- ups will also have lower listing thresholds. But US-listed multinational companies with weighted voting right structures, such as dual-class share structures, will be open even to retail investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board aims to attract US-listed multinational firms, particularly China IT companies, and shift their listing to Hong Kong, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board might also lure start- ups from China, Hong Kong and member countries of the </span><span class="s3">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last month, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the exchange has drafted a proposal for the setting up of a new board. He stressed the importance of ensuring relevant measures are in place to protect retail investors if weighted voting right structures are to be permitted.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new listing rule, which allows dual-class share companies to go public, does not have a "sunset clause," but this does not mean weighted voting rights will exist forever, according to the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Henry Lau.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If shareholders with weighted voting rights died, or were no longer the directors of a company, then their voting rights would end, Lau wrote in this blog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors worry that if dual-class shares are included into major stock indexes, they will have no choices but to buy them. Lau, however, said that major indexes companies have looked into this issue. For instance, </span><span class="s3">Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span class="s1"> said that it will not add dual-class shares firms into its major indexes including the S&amp;P 500 while the MSCI also said it will consider reducing the proportion of dual-class shares firms in its indexes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response to the criticism that Hong Kong lacks a mechanism for class actions, Lau said that the government and regulators have taken measures to protect investors' rights.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower, the world's biggest operator of mobile phone towers, will launch its share sale offer to raise between US$8 billion and US$10 billion next Wednesday, making it the world's biggest initial public offering so far this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based company, which was formed in 2014 through the merger of the transmission operations of </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Unicom</span><span class="s1"> (Hong Kong) and </span><span class="s3">China Telecom</span><span class="s1">, will launch investor road shows on Monday and its IPO will begin on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the plan.The retail market response may not be strong due to a combination of factorsAlex Wong, director of asset management, Ample Capital</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The initial target for China Tower is to raise US$10 billion, but the fundraising size could be smaller. Everything is not definitive given the current market uncertainties,” said another source, adding that the company has been closely watching market sentiment and that changes could be made depending on the response from investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">International Financing Review reported on Wednesday the mobile phone infrastructure company was planning to raise up to about US$8.8 billion at a valuation of up to US$35 billion, citing people close to the deal. The addition of a standard green shoe option of 15 per cent of the base deal size will bring the proceeds to about US$10 billion, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offering will place China Tower ahead of Xiaomi, the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, as the world's biggest IPO this year. Xiaomi raised US$5.4 billion through its listing after the green shoe option was exercised. China Tower's IPO will also be the fourth-largest flotation in Hong Kong in three decades.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post , still holds the world record for IPO size with its US$25 billion New York float in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some fund managers were a little doubtful about the response to China Tower's listing in the current market environment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital, said the IPO came at a time when liquidity is tight in the Chinese market and interest rates are relatively high, adding to the debt burden of the tower operations company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The retail market response may not be strong due to a combination of factors, including the unfavourable macro environment, the weakening Chinese yuan and the simple and not so sexy growth story about China Tower itself, as the majority of its revenue is from rental business of telecoms towers,” said Wong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added: “The company generates revenue in yuan, but the IPO is in the Hong Kong market. The expected investment returns of investors will also be subject to changes in the exchange rate between the yuan and the US dollar.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower, in which </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1"> holds a 38 per cent stake, reported 1.9 billion yuan and 76 million yuan in profit, respectively, for 2017 and 2016. In 2015, it suffered a loss of 3.6 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its revenue reached 68.7 billion yuan by the end of 2017, more than 97 per cent of which came from its tower business. It relies heavily on its three biggest clients - </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Telecom</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Unicom</span><span class="s1">. These companies contributed towards 99.8 per cent of China Tower's revenue last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower had liabilities of borrowings worth 144.6 billion at the end of March 2018, with current liabilities worth 96.4 billion yuan and non-current liabilities worth 48.2 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Institutional investors' response to the IPO may still be “OK”, depending on how China Tower values itself in the end, said Wong. “I think the only concern for them is the IPO pricing, and the response largely depends on whether it's attractive.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offshore yuan rate hit a fresh one-year low on Thursday against the greenback. Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said she expected more yuan weakness going forward, reflecting a more explicit policy decision from the Chinese authorities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The China Tower flotation will also boost Hong Kong's status in its race to retake the global IPO crown. Thanks to Xiaomi, it has edged up to No. 2 from No. 5 globally in terms of fundraising size so far this year, behind only the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">, according to </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi priced its IPO at HK$17, the low end of its indicative range of HK$17 to HK$22. Its shares have, however, swung wildly since their debut, affected by overall market volatility and a weekend announcement by mainland stock exchanges, which put a temporary halt on accepting Xiaomi into the pool of eligible shares for mainland investors to trade through the stock trading links between Hong Kong and the mainland.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange announced on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with its mainland counterparts to discuss the possibility of adding companies with weighted voting rights shares to the trading links, triggering a rebound in Xiaomi stock.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts said China Tower, which does not opt for a weighted voting rights share structure, will not be affected by the new rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong's securities regulator</span><span class="s1"> and stock exchange have overhauled the city's listing regulations, allowing companies with weighted voting rights share structures - multiple classes of shares whereby founders exert an outsized control even with minority ownership - to list in the city.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, said it did not support a draft proposal to allow companies to issue weighted voting rights (WVR), a week after markets operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it would launch a second round of consultation on the contentious topic later this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SFC is of the view that Hong Kong's securities markets and reputation would be harmed if WVR structures became commonplace,” the SFC said in a statement on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On his website, shareholder activist David Webb said: “This should kill it, as all changes to 8listing rules must be approved by the SFC.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC decision puts it at loggerheads with the HKEx over an issue many in the business community supported, hoping it would lead to greater deal flow and fee income. The debate was revived last year after Alibaba jilted Hong Kong in favour of New York, where dual-class share-holding structures enshrining minority control are allowed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In March, SFC chief executive Ashley Alder raised concerns about the integrity of Hong Kong's securities markets if the listing rules were amended.This should kill it, as all changes to 8listing rules must be approved by the SFCDavid Webb,shareholder activist</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Would fund managers apply a ‘governance discount' to stock prices, or adjust portfolio weightings away from Hong Kong?” he said. “Will the WVR proposal be the magic bullet that would cause listing hopefuls to choose Hong Kong over a foreign stock exchange?”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC said the draft proposal did not explain how many proposed safeguards and conditions could be monitored on an ongoing basis and what actions could be taken by regulators or public shareholders if they were not complied with.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of large international fund managers, including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> and BlackRock, have warned that dual-share structures could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said last week: “The second-stage consultation on weighted voting rights structures should consider the balance of investor protection and maintaining our competitiveness, as answering with a simple yes or no would be premature.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange said yesterday the SFC's view would “be material” to the proposal put forward for second-stage consultation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed listing reform put forward by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has drawn mixed reactions from fund managers who say it would be a step backward for corporate governance and investor protection, even as it would likely attract premier technology companies to list in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has achieved a lot of corporate governance reforms over the past two decades but the listing reform to allow dual-class shares structured companies to list here is a big step backward from the corporate governance point of view,” saidDavid Smith, head of corporate governance Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's month-long consultation on the rule change will conclude on March 23. The reform package would broaden the listing regime by opening the door to pre-revenue biotech companies as well as companies with weighted voting rights, a structure seen as favourable to technology companies and their founders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX said in February they would push to accelerate the timetable for the widely-expected regime change by several months, potentially ushering in new rules by late April in a bid to become the first exchange in Asia to eliminate listing barriers for technology unicorns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is sad to see Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland stock exchange change their listing rules to allow dual class share companies to list as they all want to be champions of IPOs while the regulators no longer act as the gatekeepers to safeguard the interest of investors,” Smith said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“It is positive the HKEX has proposed these dual class shareholding companies would have to adopt one share, one vote on some key events but still, I am not sure if that is good enough for investor protection,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The dual-class shares structure, also known as the weighted voting right structure, allow founders or key management to hold a premium class of shares with more voting rights than other shares. Smith and other fund mangers worry that the rule violates the “one share, one vote” principle. The weighted voting right structure is allowed in the US but not in Hong Kong, and is believed to be a major draw for tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu listing in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smith applauded some the safeguards proposed by the HKEX, such as switching back to the“one share, one vote” principle on key issues such as the appointment of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another proposed safeguard would see founders and key executives loose the premier voting status if they die or sell the shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX says listing reforms could be in place by late April[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2134495/hkex-says-listing-reforms-could-be-place-late-april]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Smith cautioned of problems in implementing the rule. For example, if some shareholders loose their special voting status, other major shareholders may see their holdings rise above the 30 per cent threshold that would require them to make a general offer under the takeover code.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the biotech firms without revenue, Smith does not expect any big corporate governance issues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have invested in a lot of mining companies which do not have revenue at the time of listing. They could still produce good returns when their mines start operation. This principle applies to the biotech firms too,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong also called for more shareholder protection measures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Similar to other key stock exchanges, HKEX is under immense pressure to come up with a more flexible regime to attract companies from the new economy as they are poised to represent the key driver for growth in the future,” Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“However, the HKEX's proposed regime tips in favour of the issuers at the expense of investors.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her industry body, which helps international fund companies operate in Hong Kong, has put forward a host of suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund industry body wants companies with dual class-shares to have a higher percentage of independent non-executive directors, perhaps as much as 50 per cent or more, instead of the third they make up on listed companies currently. Another suggestion was to appoint a lead independent non-executive director with an explicit mandate to engage with the minority shareholders and represent their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong said her association also wants to lower by half the threshold whereby minority shareholders can call for a general meeting. Currently, a general meeting can be triggered if 10 per cent of minority shareholders vote in favour of the motion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness of course is important, but setting the right balance is all the more important,” she said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's government has signalled that it intends to drop a plan to establish a new board on the city's stock exchange for start-ups and companies with multiple-class shareholding structures to raise capital, choosing instead to amend existing rules to allow these companies to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The government is likely reach a consensus with the Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SEC) and the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) in the next few weeks, and publish a conclusion of the public consultations that have taken place over the proposed new board, said James Lau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have looked at both possibilities” of whether to introduce so-called weighted voting rights, or multiple-class structure, on the proposed board or the main board, Lau said. “The chance is higher on the main board.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The unexpected comment is the first sign that the Hong Kong government, years after agonising over how best to retain and attract so-called new economy companies to raise capital in Asia's largest destination for initial public offers, is now preparing to step away from the plan. What changed was the successful IPO last month by Shanghai-based </span><span class="s3">ZhongAn Online P&amp;C Insurance</span><span class="s1">, which raised US$1.5 billion on the city's stock exchange, even as its profit track record didn't meet the main board's requirement of a combined profit of HK$50 million in the three years before listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's market ranked third among global destinations for IPOs in the first three quarters of this year, with 106 companies raising a combined HK$85 billion in the city, according to Deloitte's data. That compares with the whole of last year, when 71 IPOs raised HK$134.3 billion (US$17.2 billion).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's brokers, bankers and regulators had been divided over how best to maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness since </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> -- the world's largest online shopping platform and owner of the South China Morning Post -- abandon the local bourse to stage its record US$25 billion IPO in New York in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue was a voting structure among the company's founding shareholders that gave them veto power over the appointment of directors, a special right that contravenes Hong Kong's “one share, one vote” principle. Ever since, Hong Kong had been debating whether to allow companies with dual-class shares, a common feature among technology companies from </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> to Snapchat, to list on the exchange, or establish a new board to cater for them. The New York and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> bourses allow these dual-class stocks to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/2aca847a-b7ed-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_image_hires_203112.JPG]In June, HKEX proposed to set up a new board, or so-called “Third Board”, as part of its broader market reform. The new board will permit dual-class shares, a structure designed to give specific shareholders more voting power than others. Shares in one class carry one vote, while shares in another carry multiple votes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over these past few years, we have all observed a better trend in the development of this particular sector and do have a better grasp of the future direction,” Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said today during a taxation forum. “So under different sets of circumstances now, if we can have a proper safeguard design and have them put in place, allowing companies with weighted corporate structures to be listed is not impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move has been regarded as part of the exchange's efforts to woo more technology and emerging companies amid growing competition for initial public offerings among global markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposal's public consultations ended last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Previously, media reports said HKEX plans to highlight four points in the conclusion of public consultations, which could pave the way for a potential next round of consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four points include supporting the introduction of weighted voting rights in Hong Kong, making rule changes to the main board instead of setting up a new board, scrapping the establishment of a new listing segment targeting tech start-ups, and adding new rules to attract emerging companies such as biotech firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2015, the HKEX proposed to allow dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong, but the SFC rejected the proposal. Nonetheless, the commission said it supported public discussions of the new plan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Securities and Futures Commission will conduct stress tests more frequently with brokerage firms amid the volatile stock market, chief executive Ashley Alder said yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``We will ensure that the market operates in an orderly manner,'' Alder said. ``That means effectively looking at market participants, in particular the brokers, to ensure that they are stable from a financial perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``In that context, we can do normal stress tests. In more volatile conditions we can do the test more frequently,'' he said, adding it is one of the two main goals of the securities watchdog.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another goal is that the SFC will ensure that the risk management function of the local exchange is operating properly, by cooperating ``very closely'' with the local bourse, Alder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said so in response to market worries that illegal activities may emerge amid a volatile stock market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> is busy launching a series of measures to rescue the A-share market, market watchers are concerned the stock connect between Shenzhen and Hong Kong may be delayed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder said he would not comment on the mainland market, but the regulators would announce once they have settled the date to launch the stock linkup.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also reiterated that the dual-class listings will not work.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower, the state-owned wireless infrastructure operator, filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong that could match the city's biggest since 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the world's largest telecom tower service provider didn't give a fund-raising target or proposed timing of the sale in its filing dated Monday, the IPO may raise about US$10 billion (HK$78 billion), people with knowledge of the matter said last June. The Beijing-based company reported a profit of 1.9 billion yuan last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower was formed by combining the transmission facility assets of </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Unicom Hong Kong</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">China Telecom</span><span class="s1"> in 2015 as part of a broader plan to improve state-owned enterprises by attracting private investors to them.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Each of the state-owned carriers holds a stake in the tower company and pays leasing fees to use its facilities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A planned Xiaomi sale and the China Tower IPO may add up to US$20 billion, surpassing last year's total for initial share sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Xiaomi was the first company to file for IPO with a weighted-voting rights structure after the city's exchange changed rules last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The electronics maker may raise at least US$10 billion in the share sale, people familiar with the matter have said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies raised about US$16.6 billion through IPOs in Hong Kong last year, the data shows. The most recent sale for more than US$10 billion was </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">'s 2010 offering at about US$20.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China International Capital and Goldman Sachs Group are joint sponsors for the planned China Tower share sale.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Henry Lau said that China Tower's IPO could compete with Xiaomi' s listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan to raise up to US$1 billion each from Hong Kong listings this year, riding on the global boom in cryptocurrencies, IFR reported yesterday, citing people familiar with the plans.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Zhejiang Ebang Communication has also started working with advisers on a proposed Hong Kong float of up to US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, the private equity owners of </span><span class="s3">Belle International Holdings</span><span class="s1">, the biggest women's shoe retailer in China, are considering a spinoff of its sportswear distribution business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hillhouse Capital and CDH Investments, are weighing a Hong Kong IPO of the unit as soon as next year. A listing could raise about US$1 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The business sells brands including Adidas, </span><span class="s3">Nike</span><span class="s1"> and Puma in China, according to Belle's website.

Basic earnings per share was 0.759 yuan but no interim dividend was declared.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We placed more priority on fast growth of the company than gross margin growth in order to gain long-term opportunities," chief financial officer Zhou Shouzi said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said that Xiaomi's international expansion plans included developing other businesses such as TV and internet services in India. Apart from focusing on the western European market where its business grew twenty-seven fold in the first half, the company also expects to enter other East Asian markets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse has already set up a discussion group with mainland exchanges to work on the possibility of including dual-class listed firms into stock connects, she said, adding that Chinese government's plans to launch Chinese Depository Receipts also indicates its recognition of companies with weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In IPO news, Viomi, a supplier of internet-connected home appliances to Xiaomi, said it is planning an initial public offering in the US, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Viomi, based in the southern Chinese city of Foshan, counts Sequoia Capital and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC among its investors, according to its website.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The four-year-old company could seek about US$200 million in the share sale, the people said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Viomi aims to list as soon as this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, </span><span class="s3">Zai Lab</span><span class="s1"> is planning a Hong Kong float after its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> debut last year, in what would be the second US-listed Chinese biotech firm to return to the city following an implementation of new listing rules, sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While the Shanghai-based company has yet to finalize the size of its Hong Kong offering, one of the sources said it would likely sell 10-20 percent of its enlarged share base.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The deal is expected to be launched early next year, sources added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The biopharmaceutical firm raised US$172 million from its </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> IPO in September 2017. It had a market capitalization of US$1.18 billion at Tuesday's close in New York.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is host to the world's busiest venue for initial public offerings this year, but has suffered the worst losses in a decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A boom in technology listings has propelled local deal value to US$35.7 billion (HK$279.32 billion), ahead of the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1">. Yet companies that raised at least US$100 million dropped 6.2 percent in their first month of trading on average, the worst return since 2008.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A sharp pickup in IPOs may signal a sector's down cycle ahead," said Liang Jinxin, a strategist at Tianfeng Securities. "Technology companies fear an industry downturn will get worse if they don't go public now."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New-economy firms accounted for more than 40 percent of Hong Kong's proceeds this year, up from about 20 percent in 2017. But they have also been some of those that suffered the most, with giant Tencent (0700) heading for its worst year on record.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing reform to attract technology companies helped boost IPO supply, but the demand remained slack amid macro weakness, said Philippe Espinasse, former head of Asia's equity capital markets group at Nomura.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Both firms listed with weighted voting right, smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810) and food-delivery giant </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> (3690) fell yesterday, with the latter losing 4.38 percent and extending a record low.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For firms that raised more than US$100 million in Hong Kong this year, individual investors placed orders for a median 1.6 times the stock available to them, down from 2.4 times in 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Despite sluggish demand, Chinese companies decided to go ahead with their listings to bolster their war chests as the United States increased interest rates and fought with China on trade, Espinasse said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, mainland telecom software firm </span><span class="s3">AsiaInfo Technologies</span><span class="s1"> (1675) closed at HK$10.02 on its market debut yesterday, 4.57 percent lower than its IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, </span><span class="s3">Pacific Millennium Packaging</span><span class="s1">, the mainland corrugated packaging supplier, has raised HK$299.13 million after setting its IPO price at HK$3.98, the bottom of its indicative range.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chairman Chow Chung-kong said the main mission of the bourse this year is to expand the listing rule to welcome new-economy companies that can provide more choices for investors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow said the consultation of the reform is mainly about weighted voting rights, biological technology, innovative enterprises listing and companies' secondary listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chow will retire in April, and the new chairman will be appointed at the annual general meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He did not respond directly to whether Laura Cha Shih May-lung, an HKEX director, will be the next chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But he said she has worked as an HKEX director for some six years and her rich knowledge and experience in the financial industry can promote the development of the bourse.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange said yesterday it has agreed to work with China's bourses towards the inclusion of dual-class shares in a cross-border trading link, marking a step towards resolving a dispute on the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The latest statement from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> says dual-class shares will be subjected to an initial "special stability trading period," after which they could be included in the stock connect scheme that allows investors from China and Hong Kong to buy shares in each other's markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX did not define what it meant by stability nor how long dual-class shares - which give greater voting rights to company founders over individual investors - may have to wait for inclusion in stock connect. The bourse operator has set up a working group with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to address the issue "as soon as possible."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The decision marks a partial victory for HKEX Chief Executive Officer Charles Li, who flew to Beijing after Chinese exchanges surprised the market on Saturday when they said they would exclude companies like Xiaomi from the stock connect because investors didn't understand the risks associated with the new products. Permitting weighted-voting structures was the centerpiece of a years-long struggle to attract technology listings to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi (1810), the first, and so far only, firm to list with two classes of shares under Hong Kong's new listing rules, rose more than 6 percent on the news, after slumping on Monday, following the surprise announcement from two mainland exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Key details like the length of the new stability period, and who decides its length, are still unclear, but this announcement will at least calm things down," said Louis Tse, managing director of asset management at Hong Kong financial services firm VC Group.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It suggests that an agreement will eventually be reached, boding well for both sides." After the announcement, the share price of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) rose by 0.60 percent to HK$233.40.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A resolution would be a relief for Hong Kong, which changed its listing rules earlier this year to attract companies with dual-class shares to the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The financial hub already has major IPOs in the queue, such as </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1">, China's biggest platform for on-demand services, and steel e-commerce platform Zhaogang.com, that have filed to list with two classes of shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meituan's deal is expected to raise more than HK$31.40 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing reforms have come as the city jostles for the top global IPO venue crown with New York and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first half of this year, Hong Kong was the top ranked Asian exchange by IPO proceeds, according to </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> data. Shanghai was in second place.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Competition between the Hong Kong exchange and New York and mainland exchanges is inevitable, and the rule changes seem to be part of it," said Mike Suen, a partner at law firm Withers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"I don't see this particular change, however, it ends up, as having too much effect on where companies decide to list. Inclusion in stock connect is normally a marginal factor in companies' decision," Suen added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's new bourse boss says she will draw up a strategic plan to take the stock exchange operator into the next decade.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Laura Cha Shih May-lung, who was elected the new chairwoman of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> yesterday, said her priority is to prepare its next three-year plan - 2019 to 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha, also the chairwoman of the Financial Services Development Council, a government advisory body, said there is no conflict of interest in her roles, but added she is ready to step down as the head of the FSDC if the government finds a suitable replacement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha said she was honored to be the first woman to hold the top post at the HKEX, pointing out that at present around 14 percent of directors in public companies are women.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When asked whether the operator would strive to invite Alibaba to list in Hong Kong since the new listing rule - which welcomes dual-class shares companies to make their debuts - takes effect on Monday, Cha said she would not comment on individual companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But, she added, the HKEX will work to attract both traditional and new-economy firms to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On concerns about whether it is bad timing to introduce reforms due to global market jitters and fears of a trade war between China and the United States, Cha said there is never a perfect time as nobody can predict the future.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha's election comes two days after the bourse operator finalized reforms of its listing regulations to allow companies with weighted voting rights structures to float in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The FSDC backed the reforms in its March response to an HKEX consultation, describing them as an "important step in the right direction." The reforms are intended to lure new-economy companies to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2001, Cha was appointed vice chairman of the mainland regulator </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> - the first non-mainland Chinese person to hold such a role. In 1997, she became the first female deputy chair of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's securities regulator</span><span class="s1">, the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Cha is a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings and also a non-executive deputy chairman of HSBC's Hong Kong operations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The three previous chairmen of HKEX, Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, Ronald Arculli and Chow Chung-kong, each served the maximum six-year term.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s new chairman Tim Lui Tim-leung said they will launch the new development scheme or policy on investor protection after a few months. However, he refused to disclose details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, he said the advisory document of Investor ID in the local market will be launched at a suitable time, and said that it is one of his major tasks in the coming year. He pointed out the proposed investor ID would benefit their regulatory work.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Backdoor listings or shall companies would affect Hong Kong's financial market, especially on our reputation," Lui said. "SFC will continue to tighten regulations."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He added that they support the stock exchange's auto delisting mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui said the commission will adopt an open-minded attitude on new product or weighted voting rights development, and the market development would be one of their considerations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui also said he will travel to Beijing to meet with the China Securities Regulatory Commission chairman Liu Shiyu, and hopes the Exchange Traded Fund connect cross-listing can be launched in the next year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the most difficult part in opening the ETF connect is that the structure of ETF products between Hong Kong and China are very different. No timeline has been set on the launch, but he pointed out the SFC has already made some comments on the consultation paper on the corporate weight voting right scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lui disclosed that the SFC received more than 80 reports of fraud and misconduct by the public through an online forum in the last two to three months, and some cases are being followed up.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1"> made a weak debut in Hong Kong yesterday, with the Chinese smartphone maker's shares ending 1.2 percent lower than its IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors were selling at a discount on the unofficial gray market last week, Bloomberg News reported, and there was some selling interest at a 5 percent discount.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing-based Xiaomi is the first firm in Hong Kong to trade with a controversial dual-class structure since listing rules were overhauled to allow weighted voting rights for different sets of shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi shares closed at HK$16.80, after touching a low of HK$16 in early trade, compared to the initial public offering price of HK$17 per share. The Hang Seng Index ended 1.3 percent higher.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hang Seng Indexes Company said Xiaomi meets the fast-entry rule of the Hang Seng Composite Index. Constituent changes will be made to relevant indexes after the market close on July 20.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1"> will be included in the Hang Seng Composite Index, Hang Seng Global Composite Index and Hang Seng Internet &amp; Information Technology Index, with effect from July 23.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's IPO valued the firm, which also makes internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, at US$54 billion (HK$424 billion), almost half the US$100 billion it had initially hoped for and below its more recent target of at least US$70 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At yesterday's closing price the company had a market value of US$53.3 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HK$17 price valued the company at 39.6 times its forecast for 2018 earnings, while iPhone maker Apple is trading at 16 times and Chinese social media and gaming giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> at 36.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Founded in 2010 by entrepreneur Lei Jun, Xiaomi is described by Lei as a new species of company with what he describes as a triathlon business model combining hardware, internet and e-commerce services. "We are an internet firm," Xiaomi chief executive Lei told the listing ceremony at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. "From day one, we've set up a dual-class share structure. Without the innovation of Hong Kong's capital markets, we wouldn't get a chance to go public in Hong Kong," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Asked at the ceremony if the low pricing of Xiaomi and some other tech firms will weigh on upcoming IPOs, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said it was not up to the exchange to have a view. "The market is always open. It's open to everybody. If you don't like the price, you can stay away."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi sold 2.18 billion shares in its IPO, 1.4 billion of which were new shares. The deal was led by CLSA, </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Morgan Stanley</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is now the biggest smartphone vendor in India and is pushing into European markets including Spain and Russia, though it has lost share in China recently to lower-cost rivals.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts say Hong Kong's technology listings have struggled in recent months, deflating investor interest, while escalating trade tensions have made it a bad time to launch an IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Nothing can help because the sentiment is no good at the moment - most of the IPOs listed this year were not that profitable," said Dickie Wong of Kingston Securities. He does not see any upsides until the CDR listing, which would boost interest.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A record 220 companies are expected to list in Hong Kong this year, raising about HK$300 billion, twice as much as last year, according to Deloitte International.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The firm also revealed that HK$243.4 billion was raised from IPOs in the first three quarters of the year, adding that the city will regain its crown as the world's top IPO destination in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Edward Au, co-leaders of National Public Offering Group of Deloitte China, said new-economy firms have dominated the IPO market, with three out of top five IPOs this year being new-economy companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dick Kay, co-leaders of National Public Offering Group of Deloitte China, said the weighted-voting right structure implemented this year by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) has been very successful, as the new rule was only implemented early this year but two companies have already listed on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, another accountancy firm EY said Hong Kong's IPO market experienced sharp spikes in the third quarter this year by both deal number and proceeds, with 18 percent of IPOs and 49 percent of global proceeds during the period.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We saw the positive impact of new listing regulations on the Hong Kong IPO market," Ringo Choi, EY Asia-Pacific IPO leader said. "However, IPO activity was also negatively impacted by interest rate hikes and investors looking for interest rate-driven investments, a trend which could continue in 2019."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The first full trial of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was successfully completed during the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">``The test was smoothly done,'' said </span><span class="s3">Bright Smart Securities and Commodities</span><span class="s1"> (1428) marketing director Kwok Sze-chi. ``Though some minor problems remain due to differences between the two markets, the scheme is technically fine with settlement and clearing.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bright Smart was among firms working through the weekend in the trial, which saw brokers place mock trades to test their computer systems for clearing and settlement processes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A September 13 trial run will simulate a failure of the stock connect system.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This comes after the stock exchange ran smaller-scale tests the previous weekend with 96 brokers that handle 80 percent of the SAR's trading volume.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other action, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) published a ``concept paper'' on Friday to seek market opinion on whether a structure of weighted voting rights should be allowed for firms listed or seeking to list on the local bourse.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has followed the ``one share, one vote'' principle for 25 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It sparked heated discussions after Alibaba sought to list last year with its 27-member partnership committee having decisive voting power in the firm.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi says it will submit its initial public offering application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week after the new listing rules came into effect on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker is expected to make a debut at the end of next month or the beginning of July in the first IPO under the new listing rule that allows new-economy companies with dual-class shares - including unprofitable biotech firms - to list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's latest value is reportedly between US$65 billion (HK$507 billion) and US$70 billion, lower than the market expectation of US$100 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But Xiaomi is expected to raise at least US$10 billion from the public offering, which may be the biggest IPO in Hong Kong this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi and </span><span class="s3">CK Hutchison Holdings</span><span class="s1"> are due to announce an alliance tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, China's largest music-streaming company, has invited investment banks to pitch next week for a role in a United States IPO worth up to US$4 billion, </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1"> publication IFR reported, citing people familiar with the plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The music arm of tech giant </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> plans to go public by the end of the year, in a deal in which it could raise between US$3 billion and US$4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent Music is seeking an IPO valuation of about US$25 billion, according to IFR.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was valued at US$12.3 billion late last year when Europe's </span><span class="s3">Spotify Technology</span><span class="s1"> swapped a stake with it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the agreement, Spotify owns about 9 percent of Tencent Music while </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> owns a 7.5 percent stake in Spotify.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Friday, Spotify had a market capitalization of US$28.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent Music first started discussion with banks about its planned IPO late last year. Progress was slow as the company focused on the Spotify transaction and was exploring the possibility of a Hong Kong listing as the city's exchange operator unveiled plans to encourage more tech companies to list in the city by loosening rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tencent Music, however, has decided to go for a US listing as Spotify is listed there and HKEx's new rules do not allow corporate entities to benefit from weighted voting rights for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx will launch a separate consultation by July 31 to explore such an option.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> will work closely with mainland regulators and strive to include new-economy companies to stock connects, hoping to confirm the timetable as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse operator made the announcement after mainland stock exchanges said they would not expand their stock connect scheme with Hong Kong to foreign firms, companies with different voting right structures and so-called stapled securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stapled securities are formed when two or more securities are contractually bound together to form a single unit that cannot be bought or sold separately.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Exchanges on both sides have agreed that foreign company shares and stapled securities will not be included in the list of eligible securities under stock connect's southbound trading for the time being," the HKEX said, implying its counterparts have not reached an agreement in accordance to dual-class listed firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai stock exchange said it reached the decision after consulting with domestic brokerages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Most of the investors expressed a lack of understanding of these new types of securities," the exchange said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Domestic investors do not fully understand the concept of stapled securities and had not completely grasped the operations and financial systems of foreign companies, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These types of securities need to wait until they have reached a certain quantity and a market operation basis before they can be considered for the participation of mainland investors," the exchange added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Responding to that, the HKEX believed companies listed in the city with weighted voting rights are eligible to be included in connects due to strict listing requirements it has set for such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The local bourse said investors are thus well protected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Only companies with a market capitalization of HK$40 billion can get listed on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China exchanges' decision not to include the three types of firms means that mainland investors will not be able to invest in </span><span class="s3">Xiaomi Corp</span><span class="s1">, which made its debut in Hong Kong last week.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Investors had kept their fingers crossed that Xiaomi's (1810) performance would be supported by capital from the mainland until the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses over the past weekend announced they would temporarily exclude companies with weighted voting rights from being traded under the Stock Connect programs.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the first company to be listed in Hong Kong under a dual-class structure, Xiaomi went through a fast track to be added to the Hang Seng Composite Index before being accepted into the benchmark FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This saw the Chinese smartphone maker's shares recover from a lackluster debut with four consecutive days of gains. Its shares, which dived in the first days of trading but later rebounded 26 percent up on its IPO price, are now likely to be dragged down.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from Xiaomi, HKEX (0388), the city's bourse operator is also among those likely to be affected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The sudden decision of the two Chinese stock exchanges has several implications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Firstly, it appears that the mainland's securities regulators, who last month postponed Xiaomi's Chinese depository receipts issue and later cast further doubts on it with a long list of questions on its listing arrangements, are not supportive of Xiaomi's dual-class structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Secondly, as a new-economy firm, Xiaomi is seen as a guinea pig for testing the new listing rules. Hong Kong made no secret that it wants such companies included in Stock Connect schemes as it believed Xiaomi investors would want to trade southbound in the absence of a CDR offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thirdly, the ruling signals intensified competition between bourses on either side of the border and highlights their discord over IPO issues. The HKEX, which used to call the mainland regulators "brothers," was just given very short notice and told of the decision just hours before the official announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Although the city's stock exchange operator has said it will work closely with mainland regulators and strive to include new economy companies in Stock Connect schemes, this is unlikely to happen any time soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is another reason as to why the regulators have barred mainland investors from trading in Xiaomi - don't forget, China's market has recently been short of capital. Its A-shares have been very weak and that's why Xiaomi CDR issue was postponed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is no doubt that China's regulators might want a firmer grip on capital fleeing to Hong Kong and the HKEX and Xiaomi are now the losers this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's shares will be under pressure this week while HKEX - which is banking on new economy firms from the mainland to list in Hong Kong and to support its development - will likely encounter a bumpy ride.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The only winner may be Tencent (0700), which slid immediately after Xiaomi was accepted by the HSCI. Tencent's stock is likely to win support again and the forthcoming release of its results a few weeks down the line could put the internet giant firmly back on track.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange could take listing applications by "new economy" firms as early as June, said the chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, Charles Li Xiaojia .</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said HKEx is preparing for a consultation that he hopes can start after the Lunar New Year and last for up to eight weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is part of a major revamp the local bourse has been rolling out, which includes allowing startups and technology companies with weighted voting rights structures to list.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the current rules, this is not allowed. In 2014, the restriction led to mainland e-commerce firm Alibaba listing in New York after initially looking to list in Hong Kong. Ever since, the exchange has been under pressure to amend the rules. Li said his team is aiming to unveil a final plan by early June and have it in place later in the same month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He also said there is a chance that an exchange-traded fund trading link with the mainland can be launched this year. The ETF Connect will let investors buy and sell index-tracking fund products listed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said there are still technical details, among other things, to be sorted out before this third trading link with mainland markets can be introduced. Analysts are expecting it to come in the second half of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Referring to the two existing stock and bond trading links with the mainland, Li said the Bond Connect, launched last July, has seen its average daily turnover reach 4 billion yuan (HK$4.86 billion) so far this year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">(0388) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia said the next step for Hong Kong to take is to bring in more international issuers for Chinese investors to join trades through the primary connect, so the region could become an un- replaceable gear.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He declined to elaborate though on the primary connect, saying "it remains to be an inspiration, remains something we absolutely want."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said the local bourse still has no specific plans as these plans will need to be jointly made with counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On the proposed establishment of a new board, the decision will be made toward the middle of consultations with market players, he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower, the state-owned wireless infrastructure operator, has started gauging investor demand for a proposed Hong Kong initial public offering that could be the city's biggest since 2010, people with knowledge of the matter said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The world's largest telecom tower service started investor education Wednesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower's IPO could raise about US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) although the size of the potential deal could change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's preparing a share sale amid a deteriorating Hong Kong equity market, as the benchmark Hang Seng Index trades down about 15 percent from its all-time high in January.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi priced a US$4.7 billion Hong Kong IPO last week at the low end of a marketed range, valuing the smartphone maker at about half of its initial goal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A US$10 billion deal would be the city's largest first-time share sale since </span><span class="s3">AIA Group</span><span class="s1">'s 2010 offering of about US$20.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China Tower was formed by combining tower assets of </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1"> (0941), </span><span class="s3">China Unicom Hong Kong</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s3">China Telecom</span><span class="s1"> (0728) in 2015 as part of a broader plan to reform the nation's state-dominated wireless industry.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China International Capital and Goldman Sachs are joint sponsors for the planned deal. CICC and </span><span class="s3">Goldman Sachs</span><span class="s1"> are the joint sponsors of China Tower's IPO.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi, the first firm to list with weighted voting rights, will start trading on July 9. Xiaomi Futures and Options will also be introduced on that day and issuers can list Xiaomi derivatives warrants from then on. Xiaomi shares will be included in Designated Securities Eligible for Short Selling on the listing date.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index said Xiaomi does not qualify to be included in the index because the company's voting structure is unequal.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In other IPO action, the local interior design service provider Steve Leung Design Group (2262), which will go public today, closed at HK1.06, 20.5 percent higher than the offer price of HK$0.88 in the grey market yesterday. Investors stand to gain HK$540 for one board lot of 3,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Intron Technology Holdings (1760), a mainland automotive electronics solution provider, has been oversubscribed for 15 times in the retail tranche. It offered 250 million shares at HK$2.9 to HK$3.33 apiece and the minimum investment for one board lot of 1,000 shares will be HK$3,363.6. The trading debut is set for July 12.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Also, the mainland online credit card management platform 51 Credit Card Inc. (2051) offered 118.7 million shares at HK$8.5 to HK$11.5 apiece. The minimum investment for one board lot of 500 shares will be HK$5,807.9. The trading debut is set for July 13.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange described a dispute with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges over plans to bar investors' access to dual-class shares as temporary, while analysts believe the ban is to stay for the time being.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mainland exchanges caught investors and Hong Kong stock exchange officials off guard on Saturday when they said they would not allow mainland investors to buy shares in Hong Kong-listed foreign firms, companies with different voting right structures or so-called "stapled" securities.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li Xiaojia, pictured, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said he will fly to Beijing today and discuss the move with Chinese regulators and bourse officials.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When you look at the two announcements, it is not about whether to include, it's about when to include - it's about temporarily giving people a chance to look at it, to study how it will work, but the direction of the inclusion is not changing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said any small difference between the exchanges is not going to change Hong Kong's role as a connector between international markets and China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, analysts found Li's move pointless and are convinced that the ban is due to Beijing's determination to develop Chinese depository receipts.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"That's only Li's own wishful thinking," said Shum Chun-ying, chief of Sincere Securities. "The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> will meet with him, but will not change its decision."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He argued that the commission aims to protect mainland investors, given that Xiaomi, the first company to list in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights, failed to answer a long list of questions required by the regulator and withdrew its Chinese depository receipts application last month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Thus it still holds a lot of doubts on Xiaomi, and if the company makes it into stock connects, that would still hurt benefits of investors in the country."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides, if Xiaomi does trade in the mainland via Chinese depository receipts, it is not fair on investors who buy Xiaomi now when it is highly overvalued, said director of Phillip Securities Louis Wong Wai-kit. The prohibition has nothing to do with capital outflow, Wong added.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The United States completed its public consultation on proposed fresh tariffs on US$200 billion (HKS1.56 trillion) of Chinese goods last Friday, but President Donald Trump did not take action as quickly as expected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Does it mean that he is ready to strike anytime from now or it is a Fabian strategy due to pressure from multinational corporations?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It feels like it's a "half empty or half full glass" philosophy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, I believe there is a great chance that Hong Kong stocks would be stable in short term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This week will be one of capital raising.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last Friday, </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> (3690) kicked off its public tranche and China's biggest hotpot restaurant chain Haidilao is to follow this week.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These two debutants are very different in the nature of their business and scale of fund-raising but retail investors seem to favor the latter more.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The will of retail investors to enter the market has been severely tested due to the weak performance of the equity market in recent months.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And though Meituan would be the second dual-class listed company on the main board, public response has been average. Meituan has so far recorded HK$640 million margin financing in security houses, which is only 37 percent of its public tranche, and worse than smartphone maker Xiaomi's book-building.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have a lot of similarities. Both are large new economy stocks that recorded huge losses before going public, both saw a stock market downturn before listing, and both will be listed with a weighted-voting structure.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These could be significant reference points for potential IPO subscribers and investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a matter of fact, Meituan has attracted better overseas funds subscription than Xiaomi's. It has so far lined up five cornerstone investors including Darsana Fund in the US, </span><span class="s3">Lansdowne Partners</span><span class="s1"> in the UK and China Chengtong Holdings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li Ka-shing's private fund, Thomas Lau Luen-hung and Adrian Cheng Chi-kong are also reported to have taken parts in subscriptions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Apart from the market's weakness, there are other reasons why retail investors are holding back.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's poor book-building and pricing have affected their interest in Meituan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus, prospective investors are sitting on the fence for now.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It's uncertain if Hong Kong stock market has entered bear territory, but it is true that retail investors prefer short-term speculation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Xiaomi's case is worthy of reference, investors can hold their interest till Meituan goes public and see if it breaks through.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi fell to HK$16 on its debut day, 6 percent lower than its IPO price of HK$17, but made an upturn to above HK$22 later. The share price of the phone vendor is currently at HK$16.5.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, history will not repeat itself easily. Meituan may not be able to emulate Xiaomi's miracle of turning a huge loss into a 14.6 billion yuan profit in the second quarter. Not to mention that this turnaround was partially due to some financial wizardry such as its CEO Lei Jun receiving a massive bonus, which could be difficult for Meituan to imitate.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's retail investors have their own preferences and with the exception of Meituan, they might well prefer a hotpot.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Haidilao might well be a better bet - at least it already seen a profit before listing.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (0388) is in talks with the securities regulator about a holistic consultation on the listing regime this year, covering listing regulation, Growth Enterprise Market review and new board, said chief executive Charles Li Xiaojiao.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the exchange operator has produced the document drafting for the consultation and is awaiting the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1">'s approval. He added there is no timeline for the consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC and exchange had a consultation on the listing regulation that ended in November. Feedback is being considered and analyzed by the two bodies, said HKEx.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said a holistic consultation is needed as the three issues are not isolated. Viewing things separately just results in endless discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new board will be considered as a solution to the dispute on whether to allow issuers with weighted voting rights to list on the exchange. The board may also accommodate early-stage issuers that are viewed as riskier on the GEM board and multinational and "Belt and Road" issuers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The review of the GEM board will focus on a placing-only offering mechanism, minimum shareholders' requirements, entry requirements and a transfer to main board mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Backdoor listings, long-suspended companies and delisting faced by both main and GEM boards are planned to be covered by the consultation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, HKEx plans to set up a private market in the fourth quarter, which is a platform to provide registration and share transaction services for unlisted companies. Li said the platform will not be regulated by the SFC, thus no approval needs to be gone through.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said the private market aims to attract more start-ups to register in Hong Kong, which is also an incubator for listing candidates on the new board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The platform will also accommodate de-listing firms on the new board, which would adopt a more aggressive de-listing rule. It will also be a field test for the blockchain technology, added Li. Ideally, shareholding information would be available to investors on the platform, where investors could also transact shares of private firms, needing no help from brokerages.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For increasing product offerings, HKEx will roll out yuan currency options and a USD/offshore yuan contract in late March, mainland Ministry of Finance T-bond futures in the first half, and futures on its co-branded yuan index that tracks offshore yuan against a basket of currencies in summer or the third quarter.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange needs to introduce additional measures to protect minority shareholder rights if it allows the listing of shares with unequal voting rights, including putting a time limit on them, Norway's sovereign wealth fund argues.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange proposed in December to introduce dual-class shares, which typically give one set of shareholders greater voting rights than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A number of Chinese tech groups are considering where to list their shares in 2018. And unequal voting structures are favored by technology companies as a protection against shareholder pressure for short-term returns.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The influential Norwegian government pension fund - the world's largest with assets of US$1 trillion (HK$7.78 trillion) - wrote to the Hong Kong exchange to say that while it supports measures to motivate companies to go public it was concerned about the impact on minority shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We regard the protection of minority shareholder rights as a necessary requirement to safeguard and promote the fund's long-term financial interests," it said. "To maintain market standards for investor protection we see the need for additional measures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One measure should be a time-based phase-out of unequal voting rights, and another should be to strengthen standards governing the independence of non-executive directors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Unequal voting structures have been criticized by corporate governance advocates, who warn of potential abuse by companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Certain matters, such as transactions involving entities associated with holders of weighted voting rights, should always be subject to the "one share one vote" principle, the fund said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, also known as the oil fund and one of the world's largest investors, said it had US$26.6 billion invested in shares listed in Hong Kong at the end of 2017.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC plans to implement a real-time investor identification system around mid-2018 for northbound trading under the Stock Connect program, to detect potential misconduct.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move is in line with global efforts to mitigate market volatility through greater transparency, and comes as China seeks to woo foreign institutions to invest more in its stock markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ashley Alder, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission, told the Thomson Reuters Pan-Asian Regulatory Summit yesterday that the identification system would be developed with the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC and the CSRC are now working on a new system with Stock Connect that would give both regulators a direct, real time line of sight in cross- border trades," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is expected to begin for northbound trade around the middle of next year and at about the same time we expect the mainland regulator will provide an equivalent level of transparency for us for southbound trading."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alder also said the SFC saw "enormous" potential for trading of risk management products in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is because larger, more diverse capital flows will demand better overall risk management tools subject to a world class regulatory environment," he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the same event, David Graham, chief regulatory officer and head of listing at </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, said weighted voting rights need to be adopted to lure so-called new economy firms to list on a planned third trading board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese web portal and social media firm </span><span class="s3">Sina Corp</span><span class="s1"> is planning a secondary listing in Hong Kong, in what would be one of the first floats to take advantage of the city's new rules designed to attract tech equity offerings, two sources said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Nasdaq-listed Sina, which has a 46 percent stake in China's Twitter-like Weibo Corp, is working with advisers on the listing that will likely take place in the fourth quarter, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The offering size is yet to be finalised, the sources said on condition on anonymity as the deal details were confidential.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sina did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The listing plan comes at a time when </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has loosened its rules to woo Chinese new-economy companies, including tech firms and early-stage drug developers, to list in the Asian financial hub.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Under the new rules, firms in Greater China that listed in New York or on the main board of the </span><span class="s3">London Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on or before December 15, 2017 are allowed to list in Hong Kong with their existing weighted voting rights structures- which give greater powers to founding shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is a big shift for Hong Kong whose one-share-one-vote principle has for 30 years blocked efforts by tycoons from Li Ka-shing to Alibaba's Jack Ma to list alternative shareholding structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is hoping that easing rules for secondary listings and allowing primary listing of companies with dual-class shares will help it compete better with New York and mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> is seeking views on whether the city should change the listing rules to introduce the controversial dual-class share structure in a bid to compete with the US after losing the listing of Alibaba to New York and draw technology firms to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Almost 25 years have passed since the restriction on weighted voting right structures was implemented in the listing rules," said David Graham, HKEx chief regulatory officer and head of listing, adding the time is right to review the issue though he said the exchange has no position on the matter. It may keep the rule if the consultation showed opposition to the change. If the proposal garners supports, it will have a second consultation on how to implement it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange started consultations yesterday on the change which would allow companies such as mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba, London-listed </span><span class="s3">Jardine Matheson</span><span class="s1"> and US-listed English football club </span><span class="s3">Manchester United</span><span class="s1"> to have special shareholding structures to list here.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These firms have dual-class share structures that allow one class of shareholders to have more rights than others, a practice banned in the local stock exchange since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, legislator for the financial services sector, said HKEx needed to give details on how to protect the interests of retail investors before the public could decide if it would support the rule change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission said the regulator "welcomes the release of the exchange's paper dealing with an issue which has given rise to widespread views and commentary in Hong Kong and further afield. We express no views on the merits of allowing weighted voting rights in whatever form".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange paper also asked if it should allow only newly listed companies to adopt such a structure and ban existing firms from making the shift. It also asked if it should be restricted only to technology or innovative companies. It also wants to know if the public wants to keep the main board rules unchanged but revamp the Growth Enterprise Market, or introduce a separate board for companies with unique shareholding structures, as suggested in June by the government's Financial Services Development Council.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange's move came after it refused last October to give Alibaba an exemption for the dual-class share rule. Alibaba wanted to list in a way that would allow its founder and key executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only hold a minority stake.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time, the SFC said it believed an exemption would go against the one-share, one-vote principle in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba then took its listing to New York, where the dual class share system is allowed. It is due to start a roadshow soon.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Besides Alibaba, the exchange paper showed it lags the US in getting information technology firms to list here. At the end of May, a third of the 102 mainland companies listed in the US have dual-class share structures and 70 per cent of them are IT companies. In Hong Kong, only 6 per cent of newly listed companies from January 2010 to December 2013 were IT firms.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEx) is preparing to launch a second stage of consultation on weighted voting rights, in the third quarter of this year at the earliest, with an emphasis on higher governance standards for a small group of sizable listings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The demand for a more stringent regulatory regime for companies wanting to use dual-share structures was bolstered by opposition to the proposal from a number of large international managers including </span><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1">, BlackRock and </span><span class="s3">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia</span><span class="s1">, who warned their introduction could diminish minority shareholders' voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are considering proposing that, generally, 'one share-one vote' should prevail but that weighted voting rights structures should be allowed for certain companies in certain circumstances and with certain safeguards," David Graham, HKEx's chief regulatory officer and head of listing, said on Friday. "It is not our intention that such structures become commonplace in Hong Kong."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He said he expected such structures would only be allowed for large, fast-growing, companies, and that one investor-protection proposal was to make compliance advisers permanent, rather than staying for a year when listing on the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ben Kwong, a director of brokerage KGI, said the investing public should be aware of the potential risks associated with companies that adopted a standard other than the "one share-one vote" principle since Hong Kong, unlike the US, did not allow class-action lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba dumped Hong Kong and opted for a New York listing last year, raising a record-breaking US$25 billion. The decision to list in the US was primarily due to Hong Kong's refusal to allow the company's request for dual-class shares and a partnership structure that would have allowed management to nominate a majority of board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Fidelity</span><span class="s1"> said dual-class shareholding structures could reduce the alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders, a key "soft" protection in a low free-float market such as Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Gaud, senior portfolio manager at Edmond De Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters: "If Hong Kong is losing mandates to the US or in the future to Shanghai, it is good the situation is reviewed. But they would need to balance what they are giving away to the major shareholders, founders and promoters, by not forgetting about the minority shareholders."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx said institutional investors supportive of the proposal included </span><span class="s3">Norges Bank</span><span class="s1"> and CICC Hong Kong Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The second-stage consultation will last for about three months.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's securities watchdog has signalled its intention to get off the regulatory back seat and play a more active role in reforming the city's financial rules for attracting so-called New Economy companies to start shop and raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a speech to 900 Asian regulators and fund managers 10 days before the deadline of a public consultation on reforming Hong Kong's financial rules, the Securities &amp; Futures Commission's Chief Executive Ashley Alder rattled off a list of reforms much-needed in the city, from rules covering algorithmic trading to overhauling the outdated Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The SFC is keen on making sure that our regulation regime is fit for the market in 2017, not 1988, when the market was dominated by domestic companies and traded by domestic investors," Adler said. "Nowadays, Hong Kong's market is traded by international investors."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's US$4.1 trillion stock market trails behind China and Japan as Asia's third-largest equity market by value. While it's still much bigger than Singapore's US$475 billion market capitalisation -- and the city remains home to the world's largest IPOs this year -- Hong Kong has been increasingly challenged as its southern rival had been doing more to attract financial-technology companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A public consultation has been underway in Hong Kong since June to reassert the city's role as Asia's financial hub and a place for so-called New Economy companies including Internet and fintech startups to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the centre of the debate is a proposal to create two committees in the approvals process of initial public offerings, which will propel the SFC into a frontline regulator alongside the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, rather than its current role of approving or rejecting a decision by the bourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Supporters of the plan said it will improve the quality of the market, while opponents are concerned that having the SFC in the front seat may lead to excessive regulation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having both the SFC and the HKEX in the proposed listing regulatory committee and the listing policy committee will enable them to negotiate any changes in listing rules in an "efficient, accountable and transparent way," Alder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s founder Jack Ma said Hong Kong needs to reform the city's listing rules[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2042400/hong-kong-must-reform-financial-rules-attract-new-economy-ipos] to attract New Economy companies and remain relevant.?utm_source=wisers&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba raised US$25 billion in 2014 in New York in the world's largest IPO to date, skipping Hong Kong after the Hong Kong exchange rejected the company's partnership structure, which grants a group of founding partners[http://www2.alizila.com/alibaba-offers-alternative-view-good-corporate-governance] the right to nominate the majority of directors subject to shareholders approval.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, which operates the Alipay electronic payments platform for Alibaba, is poised for an IPO. The company is valued at US$60 billion, and Ma said the company's IPO destination depends on the willingness by Hong Kong's regulators and market watchdog officials to embrace innovation. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"At no point did the SFC decide that some form of weighted voting rights (dual share holding structure) is totally impossible in Hong Kong," Alder said at </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">' 7th Pan Asian Regulatory Summit on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange had proposed in 2015 to allow certain companies with so-called dual-share structures to list in the city. The SFC opposed the draft proposal because there weren't enough measures to protect investors' interests, Alder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the US, where many Internet companies including </span><span class="s3">Facebook Inc</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google Inc</span><span class="s1"> had dual-share structures, measures are in place to safeguard investors' interests, including sunset clauses that set an expiry date on the structure, or a moratorium on founders from transferring their special-class shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Although it's impossible to predict what the final result would have been for such a difficult topic as weighted voting rights, I am absolutely sure that the protracted and ultimately inconclusive process which ended in 2015 would have been handled far more satisfactorily through a better decision-making structure," Alder said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The joint proposals envisage that representatives of all decision makers, including the SFC, would be expected to discuss the hard issues in real time in the same room, would be expected to try to achieve consensus, would be expected to follow through to a proper conclusion and, importantly, be accountable and fully transparent when finally deciding on a way forward," Alder said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HK revamps listing rules in battle for global tech giants -- SCMP headline, December 16</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This latest attempt by Hong Kong's stock exchange chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia to destroy shareholder democracy has an offhand way of dismissing his earlier, overly ambitious attempt to do away with all significant listing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That earlier concept paper in 2015 was only a “straw man”, says this latest concept paper; meaning, I take it, that it was an intentionally false proposal we were meant to knock down, so as to make it easier to introduce the real one.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Oh, thank you, Charles. So kind of you to waste our time. How very thoughtful of you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the real one (let's hope it's not just another straw man this time) does have one brand new idea: it is to allow listing by “pre-revenue” biotech companies, as long as they have a “minimum expected market capitalisation” of HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I shall ask the obvious question for you: If they are not yet selling anything, leave alone turning any profit, on what basis can the market be “expected” to value them?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Perhaps we could try the old Roman way of dealing with such eventualities. Take a live chicken, cut it open on the spot and then call in a soothsayer to tell you what the entrails forecast. It worked for the Romans apparently.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new concept paper's version of this idea is to say there “tends to be” strict regulation of activities undertaken by biotech companies, and this should be enough. If it's good enough to swallow, then it's worth at least HK$1.5 billion, you see.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We had an example of such tends-to-be strict regulation only last week, when a doctor at a beauty shop was convicted of manslaughter by administering untested biotech quack remedies. It's a big industry. Just look at its tsunami of advertisements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Let's face it. This town has a weakness for biobabble. Talk a fast line in biotech and the customers will always line up. No one understands a word of it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then we get Charles back to his one-track mindset of WVR, or weighted voting rights. Our principle of “One Share, One Vote” is to be abandoned for “new economy” companies. All shareholders are equal, but some will be more equal than others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong can now join the international race for the bottom in listing standards, while the cash-out price of Charles' share options - remember that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd</span><span class="s1"> is a listed company, whose shares are trading near a record - can race for the top.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But I mustn't spread falsehoods. It is not true that ordinary shareholders will be deprived of all voting rights in WVR companies. As long as their votes don't matter, they can have a few. Maybe they can butter them and have them for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And again, of course, we get no definition of what the “new economy” is. It is “hard to define”, “not necessarily restricted to specific sectors”, “likely to evolve over time” and “the Exchange proposes to publish a guidance letter”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Any investment banker can find his way round such non-restrictions. WVR will therefore apply to the entire market from now on.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The oddity here is that recent events have made nonsense of the supposed purpose of attracting more technology listings. They have come anyway. There has been a flood of them over the last few months, as high tech, and devoid of earnings, as any mindless follower of investment fashion could want.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also worth noting that WVR does not really make a stock more attractive to the professionals. In the US, for instance, both the S&amp;P and the MSCI indices have recently announced they will not accept shares with unequal voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This matters. The MSCI indices in particular are benchmarks for institutional investors. To have your stock included in any of them is to attract big time investor interest. To be permanently excluded because of your share structure now constitutes a self-induced banishment to second class.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So why do it?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There must be some legitimate reason. I cannot imagine that every corporate chieftain who asks for a WVR listing does it only because he wants to have his cake and eat it too, and is happy to rob his shareholders in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As I say, there must be a defensible reason. But don't ask me what it is.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Not only is there no rivalry, but the two companies are working together, with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> providing surveillance technology for the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the new Shenzhen connect scheme which is due to be operational by Christmas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“They're very important clients,” she told the South China Morning Post. “We always look at if there are more things we can do with them from a business perspective.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said if companies choose to list internationally, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> works very hard to get them to choose the US, and specifically Nasdaq.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“When they come to list here, that's a decision they make for the needs that they have, and we don't see ourselves competing with Hong Kong,” Friedman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We don't sit there and get worried about it or have any issues with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Fewer firms have filed initial public offerings on US exchanges so far this year than in any year since 2009, during the midst of the financial crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Hong Kong has handled the most IPO listings in the year to date, making it the world's largest IPO market for the second year running.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> actively seeks companies in Asia to list with them, and offers tools like PR and investor relations intelligence to firms free of charge for two years to help them mature as public companies, Friedman said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is also the only major US index that allows foreign-owned companies to use their full market capitalisation to be eligible for inclusion on the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> 100.Our view is there's nothing like the US marketsAdena Friedman, president, </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our view is there's nothing like the US markets,” she said. “We're not trying to say that Asian markets aren't the right place for people.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said she wasn't concerned either about the trend of Chinese companies delisting from US indices and moving back home, noting there are occasionally periods when companies chased different markets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We give them a huge amount of visibility and I think we do it better than anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 80 per cent of technology IPOs in the US this year have listed on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has launched 84 IPOs this year to date for the US and Nordic markets, making it the leader in the US and euro-zone markets for IPOs, with five of them from China-based companies. Five more Chinese companies are hoping to list on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in the remainder of this year, while another 12 to 17 Chinese IPOs are expected to come to the US next year. The majority are expected to list on </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If Hong Kong wanted to compete with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> on Chinese technology stocks it would need to offer something on its proposed third board that it wasn't already offering, such as weighted voting rights - but that alone would not be enough, BDO director Andrew Lam told the Post.?utm_source=factiva&amp;utm_medium=intranet&amp;utm_campaign=syndication_campaign</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the medium term, it wouldn't hurt </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> as the US index still had a pool of professionals, analysts and investors, but in the long-term Hong Kong could become very competitive and build off its natural advantage of being in the same time zone and having the same culture as China, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“If we can leverage our culture and time zone as well as our history that Hong Kong is a very established and reliable international market, then I think the third board is going to be successful,” Lam said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Capital Link Investment Holdings chairman and chief executive Brett McGonegal, who managed the institutional IPO business for </span><span class="s3">Charles Schwab</span><span class="s1"> in the late 1990s, said the decision of Chinese technology companies to list with </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> was mostly to do with the legitimacy that comes from listing there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I don't think they control their destiny with Chinese companies at all,” he told the Post. “I don't think it has anything to do with the success of marketing or the success of </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> as an entity. It's more of an ego, more of a symbolic thing to a Chinese company to list there.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">McGonegal said </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">'s Achille's heel was “an overall Chinese pivot away from listing in the US”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I think there's a very negative bias in the US to Chinese-listed companies and they trade at a deep discount to what they would trade at if they listed in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology, China's largest health care and online medical platform, has been accepted by the Hong Kong stock exchange for an initial public offering (IPO), despite making hefty losses for the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's revenue soared 240.4 per cent from a year earlier, to 1.02 billion yuan (US$129.5 billion) in the nine months ended 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it still lost 497.4 million yuan for the nine months ended 2017, after a net loss of 614.2 million yuan in the first nine months of 2016, according to the application proof prospectus published on the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s website.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen-based financial conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) will spin off the health care portal, known as the “Good Doctor”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We are [still] in the early stages of development with a limited operating history in an emerging and dynamic industry, and our historical results and financial performance are not indicative of future performance,” Ping An Healthcare said in the application.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It said one of the main risk factors included the possibility of being unable to recoup the investments it has made.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It added there may well be a need to constantly upgrade infrastructure to provide increased scale and keep pace with its business development targets. But there was a chance the capital expenditure will not be recovered in part or in full.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Additionally some uncertainties remain under PRC law as to the IPO, as some past cooperations with offline medical institutions have been be deemed as providing diagnostics and treatment practices without licenses, thus creating legal risk, the company said.We are [still] in the early stages of development with a limited operating history in an emerging and dynamic industry, and our historical results and financial performance are not indicative of future performancePing An Healthcare, in its IPO application</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The potential IPO has already attracted major shareholders including Softbank Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund (7.41 per cent), and Vision Fund Singapore SPV (7.41 per cent), although no pricing details or time schedules have been set.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The joint sponsors are Citigroup Global Markets Asia and JP Morgan Securities (Far East).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Proceeds will be used for business expansion, potential acquisitions and development of AI Assistant and other technologies, the application said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched in April 2015, Ping An Healthcare offers online medical services and has 192.8 million registered users, with network coverage including 3,100 hospitals and 7,500 pharmacy outlets.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was China's largest internet health care platform in terms of average monthly active users and daily average online consultations in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">US consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan predicts China's internet health care market to grow to 197.8 billion yuan by 2026 from 10.9 billion in 2016, and online consultations to increase to 148.4 million in 2016 from 29.8 million in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's stock exchange is expected to push ahead with IPO reforms to allow weighted voting rights for technology firms from June in a bid to attract more new economy companies to list and keep its status as a global financial services leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The controversial dual-class shares are favoured by founders and certain shareholders to retain more voting rights than other shareholders while critics have argued such a structure may lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Currently Ping An Healthcare's issued share capital is split into A-shares (77.2 per cent) and class B-shares (22.8 per cent). But it will have only one class of ordinary shares upon completion of the share redesignation, the application said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In September, ZhongAn Online Property &amp; Casualty, China's first internet-only insurer, raised US$1.5 billion in a Hong Kong IPO, and given a valuation of US$13 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Analysts had said the city's first major fintech flotation suggested other technology-related firms were also able to list in Hong Kong successfully with one class of shares.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is garnering support towards creating a third board to attract technology start-ups and new economy firms. But safeguards on corporate governance, investor education and transparency in the downside risks are needed to ensure the success of the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) has just completed a consultation over the proposed third board, but a second round of consultation on the detailed rules is still needed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The new third board will offer two markets, one for listing big companies that have the dual-share structure favoured by many technology firms, which would open to all investors. The second board is for start-ups which would be accessible only to professional investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main and GEM boards have adopted the one-share one-vote principle in the belief that a dual-class share structure can lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders. Venture capitalists and fund managers also tend to oppose to weighted voting rights as they reduce the price at which they can sell their shares relative to international peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But attitudes of Hong Kong regulators and some market participants are starting to shift, with focus turning to the development of the city's future competitiveness and the appropriate measures to safeguard investors' interests and mitigate governance risk.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"HKEX's proposals strive to address the market quality and risk profile concerns," said Nelson Tang, a partner in the corporate department of </span><span class="s3">Hogan Lovells</span><span class="s1">. "Clearer guidance however from the regulators is needed and a ‘one size fits all' approach should be avoided."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For example, the suggested accelerated delisting regime may allow for quicker enforcement by the stock regulator, which is key to enhancing profitability and corporate governance if listed companies want to maintain their listed status while removing poor performers from the board, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The proposed new board PRO will restrict access to professional investors only in trading start-ups lacking a financial track record. While this may address concerns that retail investors are perceived to be more vulnerable and less sophisticated, some may argue that a complete ban is an unfair deprivation of an opportunity to invest in these high growth companies. A more flexible approach could be explored by allowing retail investors to participate with additional safeguards in place, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regulators are also looking at the "primary equity connect" concept, an extended model of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programmes as an avenue to help with the liquidity of the new and current boards, Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Marketing and investor education will help make investors savvier when investing in the tech industry, and therefore enhance the appeal for those companies to list in Hong Kong, improving stock liquidity.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's proposed third board consultation comes amid the government's promotion on Hong Kong's role in the Lok Ma Chau loop project with Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area integration, which appears to be an effort in developing an innovative culture for education and investment of new economy companies in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, Luke Waddington, chief executive of Hong Kong-based fintech Bluepool, says Hong Kong requires a more coherent regulatory framework and bigger government grants to create an innovation technology ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"These companies [in Singapore] are on the path towards growing into a large company quickly that eventually aim to IPO. But I don't get the sense that is what has been happening in Hong Kong," Waddington said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He praised Singapore's model as making things much easier for start-ups, citing the ease with which funding can be raised, as well as the ability to exit an investment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington added that Singapore has a more coherent regulatory framework designed to get different organisations to come together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore said earlier this year it was seeking public feedback on a suitable regulatory framework to allow the listing of dual-class structures. HKEX invited the public to submit their feedback on the proposed board under a deadline that ended earlier this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore has also announced that it is replicating the UK model, linking the stock regulator with the central bank and businesses so that they can create funding and sandbox mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In contrast, Hong Kong has allocated resources to business incubators in Science Park and Cyberport overseen by bureaucrats with little entrepreneurial experience.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Waddington said a better approach would be to give cash grants directly to entrepreneurs as small companies often struggle to cover the fees to meet licensing requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"When the overall ecosystem can support innovative and new economy companies, then investors will understand why we need a third board and dual-share voting structure," Edward Au, co-leader National Public Offering Group at Deloitte said. "This spirit seems to be starting to develop in Hong Kong now."</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Equity investors in mainland China will have to use either the nascent Connect programmes or the soon-to-be-launched Chinese depository receipts (CDRs) for gaining access to offshore stocks, because the country is not ready for companies with multiple classes of stocks to list, said the head of the Chinese pension fund.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There are many manipulative activities in the Chinese market” so the scheme on the Hong Kong stock exchange that allows companies with multiple classes of stocks to raise capital can't work on the mainland, said Lou Jiwei, the former finance minister who now heads China's 2.5 trillion yuan (US$390 billion) retirement fund. “Hong Kong has launched it, but it's not time yet for China to do the same.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Weighted voting rights, also known as multi-class stocks, are favoured by technology companies from Alibaba to </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> , as they enable founder-entrepreneurs to maintain control of their companies, even with minority stakes. They are so critical to attracting technology start-ups that </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's securities regulator</span><span class="s1"> and stock market operator pushed through the biggest changes in the city's listing rules in three decades to accommodate them. That wouldn't be the case in China, Lou said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, Chinese investors will rely on depository receipts which will be issued by custodian banks in exchange for shares of offshore-listed tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1"> . Another avenue is the Connect programme, through which the exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen are linked with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Chinese retirement scheme will maintain a “moderately overweight” weighting of Hong Kong's market and investment more in stocks in the scheme, Lou said. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng trades at 12.5 times earnings on average, cheaper than the 14.9 times on the Shanghai Composite Index, and the 28.3 times on the Shenzhen Composite.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As an international financial hub, Hong Kong has a valuable role to play to support mainland China's commitment to open and reform its economy, said the former People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan , at the same forum.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By launching the Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and the mutual fund recognition programme, Hong Kong is helping to channel overseas investments into mainland companies, provide a platform for them to expand overseas, improve their corporate governance, and enable Chinese firms to better compete on the global stage, Zhou added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Still, there's a gap in the number of trading days and hours between the two ends of the Connect scheme. Mainland investors get 90 minutes less trading time everyday than their Hong Kong peers, and 20 fewer trading days every year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If the trading durations and regulations between the mainland and Hong Kong can be synchronised and improved, then “institutional investors like the [pension scheme] can help expand the Stock Connect,” Lou said. “We also face pressure to maintain and increase the value of our assets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The NSSF, established in August 2000, has managed a total of 2.54 trillion yuan of assets by the end of 2017, according to Lou.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">By asset value, the NSSF is the sixth largest pension fund in the world, after Japan, Norway, the US, South Korea, and Netherlands, according to data compiled by Willis </span><span class="s3">Towers Watson</span><span class="s1"> at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, the investment return ratio for the NSSF reached 9.68 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fund has so far focused its investments in domestic, with Hong Kong among its key markets, Lou said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, China's largest ride-hailing service provider, is considering an initial public offering in Hong Kong that is expected to value the company at US$70 billion to US$80 billion, according to a report by Hong Kong Economic Times, citing unidentified people.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Beijing-based company is preparing to list as early as the second half of this year and is open to options including weighted voting rights, said Wednesday's report, which cited people familiar with the situation who don't want to be identified because the information isn't public.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In response to an e-mail inquiry, a Didi representative said it doesn't comment on listing plans.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China has one of the world's most dynamic technology start-up scenes, thanks to the rapid rise of an internet economy supported by a high mobile penetration rate and mobile-first consumer habits. A wave of Chinese technology IPOs in the next 12 to 24 months would likely set a record for Hong Kong, said John Hall, co-head of </span><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s investment banking unit in Asia-Pacific and global head of technology services, in May.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Having driven Uber out of the country in 2016 in exchange for a minority stake, the Chinese ride-hailing giant has counted Apple, Softbank, Alibaba and Tencent among its biggest shareholders. Last year it handled 7.4 billion rides, compared with Uber's 4 billion trips. Didi has also grown its global business by building alliances with Uber's US rival Lyft, Southeast Asia's Grab, Ola in India, Brazil's 99, Taxify in Estonia and Careem, a ride-hailing operator in the Middle East and North Africa region.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Market speculation over a Didi IPO has been mounting for the past year. According to the HKET report, Didi has been in pre-listing consultations with investment banks since April.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The IPO would be taking place under the shadow of a recent safety scare after Didi had to deal with the death of a female passenger. Earlier this month, a 26-year-old man logged into his father's account on Didi's car-pooling service platform Hitch and allegedly went on to rape and kill his passenger, a 21-year-old flight attendant. He was later found dead by police in a river in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The incident has revived wider concerns over the safety of online ride-hailing services. In the Henan incident, Didi's night-mode driver facial recognition system failed to work properly, according to a company statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Last week, Didi announced an overhaul of its services, including mandatory facial-recognition scanning for all drivers before they take any orders. The company has also stopped pairing up rides between 10pm and 6am after a one-week suspension of the Hitch platform.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotech firms with no revenue will be able to apply for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange from April 30 under new bourse rules, the head of the exchange said on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told a forum on Friday that the results of a consultation into reform of the bourse's listing rules would be announced on April 24, with the new rules “becoming effective the Monday after”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has been planning a major overhaul of its listing rules as it tries to catch up with New York and Shanghai and others in the race to be the world's largest market for initial public offers. It has previously not allowed listings by companies with dual-class share structures, making it less attractive to big technology firms, many of which use such governance forms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This will be the largest listing reform in Hong Kong for 25 years,” Li said, noting that companies with different classes of shares often took their listings to the US instead.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“After the reform, it will change the regulatory landscape. I am comfortable Hong Kong will be able to attract these companies to list here,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the new rules go into effect, biotech firms that have yet to generate revenue, as well as Chinese technology companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, would also be able to apply for listings, Li said. He has previously said the exchange had set a goal of overtaking the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> market within five years in terms of the number of listings of mainland Chinese biotechnology firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong plans to overtake Nasdaq as listing destination of choice for Chinese biotech firms[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2138478/hong-kong-plans-overtake-nasdaq-listing-destination]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He expressed confidence that big name companies reportedly seeking listings, including Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, oil company </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> and Chinese online payment firm </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1">, would list in Hong Kong, and did not see plans by China to create China depositary receipts (CDRs), similar to American depositary receipts, to lure tech firms home as a threat to Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“According to my understanding, </span><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> does not have a weighted voting right structure, so it is qualified to list A shares in China and H shares in Hong Kong,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Ant Financial</span><span class="s1"> is an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which decided in 2014 to list in the US and not Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was the spark for debate in Hong Kong over listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Alibaba could now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, something the company's founder, Jack Ma Yun, said in January he would “seriously consider”.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even if Alibaba opted for a CDR listing in mainland China, it would be an advantage if it also listed in Hong Kong, Li said, because Chinese investors could trade the physical stock directly via the Stock Connect scheme that links mainland and Hong Kong bourses, while international investors could arbitrage on the price differences between the US and Hong Kong listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li also saw Xiaomi as taking a similar tack, listing in Hong Kong as well issuing CDRs in mainland China.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong exchange would also welcome technology firms that are now listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) for smaller companies, also known as the “new third board”, Li said. They would not have to delist from that board in order to list in Hong Kong, he said, giving Hong Kong an advantage over Shanghai and Shenzhen, which require a delisting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement of the results of the review into listing rules would come one day before the annual shareholders' meeting of HKEX, at which its chairman, Chow Chung-kong, will step down. he had pushed for reform to be implemented during his term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, lawmaker for the financial services sector, said the mainland's CDR scheme is unlikely to be launched until the end of this year as the authorities are working on the finer details.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“With HKEX accepting listing applications from April 30 it would much faster than the mainland's CDR scheme. In addition, the mainland's requirements for companies to qualify for listing by way of CDRs is expected to be much for stringent than the HKEX.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“And since the Hong Kong stock market is traded by international investors, I believe more mainland technology giants would opt for a listing in Hong Kong than issuing CDRs.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> should have more power over listed companies to protect shareholders' interests, a study said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The suggestion comes as </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">, the operator of Asia's third-largest bourse, this week started allowing technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures and biotechnology firms with no revenue to list in Hong Kong - the biggest stock exchange reform in 25 years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The securities watchdog should be given more flexible powers such as allowing it to fine listed companies rather than having to initiate suspension proceedings as is done currently, according to a study on corporate governance conducted by two scholars at the University of Hong Kong and commissioned by the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span><span class="s1"> (HKICPA).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The new weighted voting rights rule is another evolution in Hong Kong's market. As with other developments it is necessary to ensure Hong Kong's corporate governance system remains fit to protect shareholders' interests,” Syren Johnstone, one of the authors of the report and a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said at a media briefing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong rivals the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> in terms of initial public offering volume, but lags behind its American peer when it comes to protecting shareholders' interests, the report said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The global financial markets are very competitive, and market integrity is key to investor confidence which can be boosted by sharpening Hong Kong's edge in corporate governance,” said Raphael Ding, chief executive and registrar of HKICPA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong government should take the lead and establish a corporate governance unit to protect investors, the report said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wong Kim Man, convenor of the HKICPA corporate governance working group, said Hong Kong needs to strike a balance between business development and investor protection to stay competitive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC should require listed companies to disclose breaches of listing rules when they happen, instead of waiting for quarterly or annual results to include such breaches, HKU's Johnstone said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The legislation is already there. The SFC can easily do it tomorrow,” he said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The report also suggested the regulator expand existing arrangements to non-Hong Kong companies especially those from mainland China as they make a large part of the Hong Kong market. “The [enforcement] gap leaves investors vulnerable to abuse,” it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">About 90 per cent of total funds raised in IPOs and nearly 70 per cent of average daily turnover were attributable to mainland enterprises in 2016, according to figures from the HKEX.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's shares tumbled in Hong Kong, reversing four consecutive days of advances, as the smartphone maker finds itself caught in the middle of a turf battle between the city's bourse with mainland equity exchanges as Asia's hub for technology companies to raise funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of the Beijing-based company fell by as much as 9.6 per cent to HK$19.40, after having clawed their way to close last week at HK$21.45, just short of the upper limit of the price range that Xiaomi sought for in its initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In a weekend announcement, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges unexpectedly put a temporary halt on accepting Xiaomi within the pool of eligible shares under the southward tranche of the Stock Connect programmes. That means mainland Chinese investors would not be eligible to trade in Xiaomi's Hong Kong-listed shares under the cross-boundary investment channel.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At issue is the inclusion of companies with weighted voting rights (WVRs), or multiple classes of stocks, within Hong Kong's stable of listed companies.

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shanghai and Shenzhen don't yet allow WVRs to list on their bourses, and have so far failed to float their Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) on the mainland. Mainland Chinese investors lack a proper understanding of these new equity products, especially with regards to the operational financial systems of overseas companies, the exchanges said in their joint statement.[http://www.sse.com.cn/aboutus/mediacenter/hotandd/c/c_20180714_4595614.shtml]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's stocks dropped for a second day as weaker economic growth data in the second quarter released on Monday clouded investors' sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.6 per cent on Monday, extending a 0.2 per cent decline for the previous trading day. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index finished almost unchanged. Smartphone maker Xiaomi slumped in the city after the mainland's bourses barred Chinese investors from trading the stock through the exchange link programmes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Traders sought for clues in the economic indicators from China's statistics bureau of the impact on China's economic health from the trade war with the US and ongoing financial deleveraging. Economic expansion slowed to 6.7 per cent in the second quarter from 6.8 per cent for the previous three-month period, according to the statistics bureau. While retail sales grew at a faster pace in June, growth in industrial output and fixed-asset investment both weakened.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Key second-quarter economic data were mostly in line with market's expectations,” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Shanshan Finance in Shanghai. “But the market is forward-looking and the biggest concern about investors is that data will be looking ugly for the rest of the year. The risk hasn't been removed now.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite fell 17.14 points to 2,814.04 at the close, taking its loss this year to 15 per cent as the worst performer among the world's major benchmarks. The CSI 300 Index of large-caps also dropped 0.6 per cent and the ChiNext gauge of smaller companies slipped 0.1 per cent.But the market is forward-looking and the biggest concern about investors is that data will be looking ugly for the rest of the yearWu Kan, Shanshan Finance</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Banks and property developers paced the decline among the mainland's equities as their profitability is closely correlated to the economic cycles. </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1"> dropped 2.6 per cent to 6.80 yuan and </span><span class="s3">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span><span class="s1"> lost 2.4 per cent to 5.23 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Poly Real Estate Group</span><span class="s1"> shed 2.4 per cent to 10.90 yuan after saying in a preliminary earnings statement that first-half profit increased 14.9 per cent from a year earlier. China Fortune Land Development sank 4 per cent to 25.57 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Movie studios dropped after the State Taxation Administration said late Friday that the industry's workers should pay taxes in compliance with the laws and any violation would be severely punished. Beijing Enlight Media tumbled 6.8 per cent to 9.55 yuan, the biggest decline in a month, while </span><span class="s3">Zhejiang Talent Television &amp; Film</span><span class="s1"> slumped 3.4 per cent to 12.47 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">BYD, China's biggest maker of electric cars, lost 4.4 per cent to 43.95 yuan after saying it had reported a case of an impostor employee who forged and signed contracts to the police.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Leshi Internet Information &amp; Technology</span><span class="s1"> dropped 2.3 per cent to 3.43 yuan after the troubled video-streaming operator said first-half loss would probably widen to 1.11 billion yuan (US$165.9 million) from 636.8 million yuan a year earlier on increasing costs and cash crunch.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Vatti, a maker of kitchen appliances, jumped 4 per cent to 15.18 yuan. The company will start to refund customers for certain products sold over the past month in a marketing campaign, living up to its part of the bargain should France win the Fifa World Cup champion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index added 0.1 per cent, or 14.22 points, to 28,539.66. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, or the H-share gauge, dropped 0.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi shed 1.9 per cent to HK$21.05 at the close after paring an intraday loss of as much as 9.6 per cent. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges made surprise announcements over the weekend that foreign companies, stapled securities and stocks with weighted-voting rights in Hong Kong will be omitted from the list of stocks that mainland investors can trade via the connect schemes. The bourses cited the lack of understanding of these companies among local investors.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> has decided not to proceed with a second consultation on the introduction of dual-share-structure listings in Hong Kong after the city's securities watchdog publicly opposed the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange operator's decision ends more than two years of controversy over the major listing reform, which first erupted when it lost out on the mega listing of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing committee has decided, in light of the [Securities and Futures Commission] statement, that it will not, at this time, proceed with finalising its draft proposal for discussions with stakeholders, nor seek to put forward a proposal for a formal consultation as originally proposed in the exchange announcement of [June 19],” HKEx's chief regulatory officer and head of listing, David Graham, said on Monday. “It will, however, keep this matter under review."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba listed in the United States in September last year after Hong Kong declined to give it an exemption in October of 2013 that would have allowed founder Jack Ma Yun and other executives to nominate a majority of the board even though they only owned minority stakes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many technology firms prefer dual-share structures, also called weighted voting rights (WVR) structures, which are allowed in the US but have been banned in Hong Kong since 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC opposed the exchange granting Alibaba an exemption as it believes such structures violate the one share, one vote principle and are not fair to all investors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The stock exchange issued a concept paper in August last year to ask the market whether it should study the subject. The exchange said in June its consultation had shown there was sufficient support to proceed to a formal consultation on rule changes in the third quarter of this year that would allow some large firms to proceed with such structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The SFC, however, issued a public statement a few days later saying its board unanimously opposed the stock exchange's proposal to introduce dual-shares structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx's listing committee said on Monday it would keep the matter under review, and keep an eye on future regulatory changes overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">SFC chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing said on Monday night that he respected HKEx's decision not to proceed with the second phase consultation. He said many technology firms has delisted from the US earlier this year and planned to return to the mainland to list in the A-share market, which suggested valuations might be more of a deciding factor in the choice of listing venue than WVR structures.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The SFC priority is to make sure that our rules protect the interest of all investors and to maintain a fair market,” he said. “As stated in our public statement on June 25, we were not yet convinced that the proposals on the dual-share structure reforms by the stock exchange managed to solve the problem of how to ensure that WVR will not be a common occurrence and the interests of investors will be fairly and fully protected.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I believe that we should not change our rules purely because of changing market trends.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong Tang, chief executive of Sun Hung Kai Financial, said he was disappointed by the HKEx decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Of course we would like to see the HKEx carry out the reform on the study of dual-share-structure listings,” he said. “There are some companies that want to list in Hong Kong via a more flexible structure but now the SFC has refused to let them in. We are going to see these companies opt for listing in the US instead.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Joseph Tong said the SFC or the stock exchange should consider introducing another new board with special trading rules to allow companies to list with a different structure from the main board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many overseas exchanges also have different markets for different companies with different structures or risk levels,” he said. “HKEx now only has a main board and Growth Enterprise Market, which is not flexible enough to compete with other markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Sin Chung-kai, the Democratic Party's economic affairs spokesman, said he supported the HKEx and SFC decision.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“One share, one vote is a very important principle to protect the investors in Hong Kong,” he said. “The dual-share listing structure favours some investors at the expense of the others. This system should not be introduced in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The whole debate was due to the demands of Alibaba. But I do not think we should make any tailor-rule change for any single large company to list here.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of more than a dozen Hong Kong-listed companies, most of them penny stocks, plunged more than 50 per cent yesterday morning ... -- Business, June 28</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is not the first time that penny stocks have been threatened because they give the Hong Kong stock market a bad name, far from it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But get ready to see the headlines feature this story again and again if the exchange's chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, gets away with his proposal to create a new hurdle-free trash board on the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His idea is to return to the old four-boards market we used to have before 1986, three boards of which, including the existing main board, he would be just as happy to see go away and not bother him any more as long as he can have his new trash board pro for high flying high tech stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will be for “New Economy” companies, an ill-defined catchphrase, it will list “pre-profit” companies, which ignores the question of how they can be sure that they ever will be profitable when such startups rarely are so, and it will require no track record of applicants, which is as much as saying most of them will indeed be of this dubious pre-profit nature.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, there will be no lower limit on size. Applicants will need only an “expected” market capitalisation of HK$200 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Who expects? I could list my hobby of making scale model sailing ships on this board by saying I expect it to be worth HK$200 million. You can do this, too, for any pursuit of your own. Just say the words “I expect”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If this is not enough to let you know that there will be no minimum requirements for listing, Charles Li also tells you that listing approval will be of the “light touch.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And he has given you a clue on what this might mean in his consultation document on the trash board. It means if that if you list a company on the board and then sell out all your own stock as soon as you can, leaving outside shareholders in the lurch, well, that's just fine by him.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Then we get weighted voting rights. Our investment democracy of one share, one vote is to be trashed. You can have 100 per cent control of any company you list on the trash board while not putting up a single cent for any ordinary share. It is allowed in New York, you see. Americans are great believers in democracy.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But perhaps the most pernicious feature of the trash board, and one that has not yet been widely noted, is that, while supposedly restricted to “professional investors,” this term is defined in Hong Kong as people with a portfolio of more than HK$8 million.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This does indeed rule out the poverty stricken who are ignorant outright of financial affairs, but then no broker or option-endowed exchange executive wants to deal with such penny investors anyway. They are far too much trouble. Penny stocks, yes, but penny investors, no.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But HK$8 million still qualifies a very large number of people who are sitting on unrealised profits through the ownership of their flats, and who are by no definition investment professionals. If they sell out, they can immediately play on the trash board.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This is pernicious because anyone wishing to establish a stock exchange designed to trap large numbers of people in failing, moribund stocks could do no better than to copy the trash board in every detail.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, the definition of professional investors is much more comprehensive. The United Kingdom, for instance, makes intermediaries responsible for dealing only with clients who know what they are doing. The onus of making sure of this is on the intermediary.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our rules require that intermediaries must be “reasonably satisfied,” but in practice it means nothing. If you have a portfolio of HK$8 million, you are in the water, and every shark is permitted to take a bite out of you. The sharks are absolved of all responsibility and you have no recourse.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If we are indeed to have a trash board, this problem of just who is a professional investor must be sorted out before any other.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But it won't be, and it's just one more reason to expect a steady stream of penny stock scandals from the trash board.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong may have a brand new market next year for new economy companies, according to a consultation paper released yesterday by </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) -- SCMP, June 17</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">How interesting that 30 years after unifying four stock exchanges into one exchange, we are now being asked to split it back into four exchanges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is what HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia champions in his latest attempt to get lower, much lower, listing standards for his favoured "New Economy" companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The idea is that the main board and its embarrassing secondary GEM market for failed New Economy stocks of the 1999 Internet Bubble will be given some tighter standards and then told to go away and forget themselves. Charles Li is not interested.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Charles Li's 2016 bonus may be cut as HKEX turnover shrinks[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2057953/charles-lis-2016-bonus-may-be-cut-hkex-turnover-shrinks]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">His interest lies in two new boards he wishes to set up, the Trash Pro and the Trash Premium. Okay, I'm not supposed to say that.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They are actually to be called New Board Pro and New Board Premium, not trash boards. The fact that they will appeal to the trashiest of new listings is of no consequence, none at all, absolutely.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Of these two, the big emphasis is on the New Board Pro, which will be available only to investors who have securities portfolios worth at least HK$8 million (US$1.025 million).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It will cater to "New Economy" listings, it will accept "pre-profit" companies, they will be subject to "no track record requirements", their minimum size will be an "expected" market capitalisation of HK$200 million, the listing approval will be "light touch" and they will be allowed "WVR", which stands for weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In short, you will need a microscope to find any listing standards here at all. Come one, come all, and if your business is indistinguishable from the contents of a certain kind of bin, well, the chief executive's HKEX stock options[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2090514/hong-kong-bourse-ceo-charles-lis-2016-bonus-cut-25-cent-market] don't stand to lose, at least not before he is due for retirement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Take just this WVR business, the notion that we abandon the principle of one share, one vote, and allow corporate tycoons to have voting control with very few shares, or even none at all.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX paper specifically recognises that this practice may allow poor management to perpetuate itself and to rob shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The paper also cites the findings of a survey by the Asian Corporate Governance Association, as quoted in an earlier HKEX study, that investors would apply an average 13 per cent discount to Hong Kong stocks if the exchange allowed it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's listing reform survey draws a resounding "Nay" for change[http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2088524/hong-kongs-listing-reform-survey-draws-resounding-nay]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But in the very next paragraph, the paper concludes that "we do not see any factual or analytical basis to this argument."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One's jaw drops. What? Would the writer of this arrogant scorn of investors' interests care to join the flat earth society next?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Or take the notion of a "light touch" vetting process. It means that the New Board Pro will allow controlling shareholders of a new listing to sell all their stock as soon their lock-up period expires and then treat the listing as a shell company.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The exchange has hitherto fulminated against this scandalous practice, but not on the New Board Pro. You thought the Wild West was wild, did you? Wait till you see the Wild East.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And just what constitutes a New Economy company? From what I can make out, it must have sex appeal, however defined -- an overpriced stock, promise much but deliver little, and name itself "tech", "digital" or "cyber".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Money and power struggle behind listing reform deadlock[http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2093214/money-and-power-struggle-behind-listing-reform-deadlock]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">No, sorry, I got that wrong, not the "cyber" any longer. That was the 1999 tech bubble.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And would </span><span class="s3">Amazon.com</span><span class="s1"> qualify as a New Economy company? It has just bought a big American supermarket chain, </span><span class="s3">Whole Foods</span><span class="s1">, an archetypal Old Economy company. What is it now? Would we split a listing here, half old board, half new board?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">There is a lesson to be learned here. Leave aside that it is a dubious practice to have a stock exchange go public on its own boards, we should not again include massive stock options on that stock in the chief executive's pay package.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It incentivises him to focus on short term rewards at the expense of the exchange's reputation. The evidence of it leaps out at you from every word of this consultation paper.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">These are important days for Hong Kong's financial and insurance community. There are far-reaching debates within our city and major global trends under way that will determine the financial future of Hong Kong. It's been 20 years since Britain's lease on Hong Kong ended, and the city's governance was returned to mainland China, and this has prompted plenty of comparisons between the world of 1997 and the world of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insurance sales are up almost eightfold, prompting the creation of a regulatory agency to deal with it. Stock market capitalisation is up eightfold as well, while banking assets have doubled and Hong Kong has become a world leader in offshore yuan transactions and the IPO business of raising capital. The driving force behind all of this has been the economic growth and development of mainland China.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">At the time of the handover, Hong Kong's economy made up nearly 20 per cent of the GDP of China. Now, that figure is just under 3 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Set against this 20-year upward trajectory has been some stark financial challenges. Just after the handover itself, there was the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998, and in 2008, the Global Financial Crisis. Hong Kong has not been alone in tapping into the China story; other financial centres have been competing for the same business.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Relatively few technology firms have decided to call Hong Kong home, preferring listings in more forgiving US equity markets. There is also the continued requirement of dealing with market malpractice and upgrading market quality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Against this backdrop, Hong Kong's financial gatekeepers have never been subject to any sort of qualifications check or test for their jobs, nor is there such a qualification for any of the jobs at these regulatory agencies. Our four gatekeepers come from different backgrounds - Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Norman Chan is a career civil servant; Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission Carlson Tong is a retired accountant; Chairman of the Insurance Authority Moses Cheng is a former lawyer; and </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) Chairman Chow Chung Kong a former business executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their diversity means they bring different types of knowledge and experience to the game. The relatively small financial community in Hong Kong means that the gatekeepers can get by with bilateral meetings and communications.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">This kind of chumminess may have sufficed for the previous 20 years, but will it do for the next 20 years?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong financial firms and markets are tightly linked to the mainland, and the four will need to work more closely with their mainland counterparts on cross border regulation. Nearly 40 per cent of insurance policies are purchased by mainland Chinese, over 60 per cent of our market cap are Chinese companies, and mainland Chinese are now trading 10 per cent of turnover via the two stock connects.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, HKEX is looking for big companies to raise funds through initial public offerings, including the proposed listing by </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, which if it happens, is expected to raise about US$100 billion (HK$780 billion), the biggest ever sum for an IPO. That estimate is based on the expected five per cent equity offering, valuing the company at US$2 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Another great debate opened by the HKEX concerns a new board that would allow weighted voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was over this issue that prompted </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holdings</span><span class="s1"> -- which owns the South China Morning Post -- to stage its US$25 billion IPO in 2014 in New York, which has led to angst ever since about HKEX's listing rules.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Diehards prefer one share, one vote. Several big technology firms have stated their wish for preferred voting rights, to insulate the owners from quarterly market pressures. The sacking of Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and the glaring underperformance of </span><span class="s3">Snap Inc</span><span class="s1">. (where shareholders receive no voting rights at all) have added some fuel to the fire in this debate (see: A Dual Discussion, p. 36).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Added to these turbulent events are the growing challenge of fintechs and new technology in general. The HKMA in particular has tried to harness this with the introduction of testing zones for financial technology (the so-called Sandbox) though often Hong Kong's efforts have lagged behind those of Singapore, which has been pushing ahead more aggressively. Singapore's "sandbox" scheme allows banks and small fintech start-ups to test their tech, while in Hong Kong, the HKMA allows only banks to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dealing with the multitude of these challenges is our financial regulatory environment. There are, roughly, four models of financial regulation: Institutional (where a banking regulator looks after banks, insurance regulator looks after insurance, etc); Functional (where a banking regulator looks after banking-type businesses); Twin Peaks (where one regulator looks after safety and soundness, while another polices conduct); and the Integrated Approach (where one agency looks after everything).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Singapore has adopted the Integrated Approach, while Hong Kong continues to use the Institutional Approach, dividing responsibility between the four men we interview here. Each of our financial gatekeepers believes that our current approach works well, but it requires that everyone remain friends and talking to each other at all times. If there is one thing they agree on, it is this.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That of course raises the question: what happens when the friendships break down? Friendships don't last through every phase of life, and as many of Hong Kong's wealthiest families can attest, smooth successions are not always easy. All four regulators are now in their 60s. Given their emphasis on the importance of maintaining friendships and communication, it's worth asking about succession plans for each of these agencies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">We can look ahead to ever more challenges in the financial services industries. One very big question is how we will face the regulatory aspect of those challenges, and who will be the gatekeepers of the next 30 years?</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> reported on Wednesday a 44 per cent increase in interim earnings, boosted by a raft of initial public offerings that helped it regain the top spot in global fundraising rankings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX said on Wednesday its interim net profit stood at HK$5.04 billion (US$642.1 million) or HK$4.07 per share, up from HK$3.49 billion a year earlier. This is the highest half-year profit since the exchange was established and listed in 2000. It is also higher than the 37 per cent profit growth to HK$4.8 billion estimated by </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's shares closed 1 per cent higher at HK$229 following the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">After deducting first-quarter profit of HK$2.56 billion, net profit for the second quarter from April to June stood at HK$2.48 billion, up 40 per cent from a year earlier and beating Nomura's estimate of 22 per cent year-on-year profit growth to HK$2.16 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“During the first half of 2018, the world's financial markets experienced bouts of volatility following significant corrections across major stock markets. Investor sentiment was dominated by uncertainties over escalating US-China trade tensions, geopolitical risk in several parts of the world and policy divergence of major central banks. Lingering uncertainties are likely to cast a dark cloud over global markets for the remainder of this year,” said Laura Cha Shih May-lung, chairwoman of HKEX, in her first interim results statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As the world enters a new era of fintech, there will be many opportunities as well as challenges. At HKEX, an innovation lab was established to explore the increased use of emerging technologies in various parts of our business, both operationally and strategically,” Cha said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The bourse's trading and clearing fee income was boosted by rising average daily turnover, which increased 67 per cent to HK$126.6 billion in the first half, compared with HK$76 billion in the first half of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Listing fee income rose as 108 companies launched IPOs in the first half, up 50 per cent from 72 last year, after the HKEX in April started accepting dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotech firms without revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia told reporters at a late afternoon press conference on Wednesday that Hong Kong had reclaimed the top spot in global fundraising rankings thanks to the trading debuts of China Tower and </span><span class="s3">BeiGene</span><span class="s1"> earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is back to No 1 worldwide in terms of IPO funds raised,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Wednesday action catapulted Hong Kong ahead of the </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1"> in terms of global rankings, bringing its year-to-date fundraising to HK$187 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“We have received three weighted voting right companies and nine biotech firms applying to list in Hong Kong under the new listing regime. There are dozens of more companies making enquiries,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">He cautioned of challenges ahead in the second half due to lower turnover as investors focused on rising trade tensions between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/08/fec6023e-9949-11e8-9a20-262028f49e8a_image_hires_201439.jpg]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX's board said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$3.64 per share, up 43 per cent from HK$2.55 a year earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect scheme linking Hong Kong with mainland China exchanges brought in revenue of HK$365 million in the first half, more than double the HK$162 million a year earlier. Funds from mainland Chinese investors into Hong Kong stocks now represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of market turnover.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“There is a large pipeline of ‘new economy' listings which, in our view, could change the market dynamics and structurally lead to higher turnover,” said York Pun, an HSBC analyst, in a research note before the results announcement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Robert Lee Wai-wang, executive director of Hong Kong-based broker Grand Finance Group, said he was upbeat on the earnings prospects for HKEX in the second half in spite of global political and economic headwinds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The market turnover of HKEX in the second half of this year may be affected by the poor market sentiment. The US and China trade war may continue to haunt markets. Interest rate rises would also have an negative impact. However, the listing reform could bring in more technology firms and biotech companies to list. The long-term outlook of HKEX remain positive,” Lee said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia will hold a press conference in the afternoon to discuss the results.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six months after pushing through the biggest change in Hong Kong's listing rules in three decades, what has the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX) gained?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Its stock price has plunged nearly 19 per cent since April 30 when the reform kicked off, losing HK$60.53 billion (US$7.72 billion) in value.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When HKEX chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia touted the success of the listing reforms that the exchange operator had pushed through with the city's securities watchdog agency, he described it as the biggest game-changer since 1993, when Chinese companies were able to raised capital in Hong Kong through H shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"It will not be in the single digits - more than a dozen companies will apply” to raise capital in Hong Kong, Li said at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reform opened the way for tech companies with weighted voting rights - commonly known as dual-class shares - and pre-revenue biotech firms to raise capital.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Six months later, Hong Kong's key stock index is in bear market territory, interest rates are up, and the appetite for raising capital has shrunk. As many as 19 so-called Chinese new-economy companies raised HK$115.8 billion in Hong Kong in the first nine months, more than double the HK$53.8 billion raised by 17 Chinese new-economy companies in New York, according to the HKEX data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While that was enough to help Hong Kong reclaim its crown as the world's favourite market for IPOs, it could not have come at a worse time. The market is down, which means most of the companies are trading below their IPO prices, and that has scared other companies away from raising funds.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Four of the five companies that did list under the new rules, including the world's fourth-biggest smartphone maker Xiaomi, either had a flat trading debut, or fell on their first trading day. Online food delivery </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> was the only company to debut at a premium, according to Bloomberg data.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Even long-term investors had their fingers burnt, as these five stocks had fallen by between 20 to 56 per cent below their IPO price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"This is definitely a disappointing set of results for the listing reform,” said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a veteran stockbroker who is also Hong Kong's lawmaker representing the financial services constituency. "The number of new listings under the new regime is far fewer than expected. These stocks are not performing well, and investors have lost money. The benefit of the listing reform is far less than anticipated.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">New listing rules likely to attract a dozen applicants in first round, says HKEX chief executive[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2143158/new-listing-rules-likely-attract-dozen-applicants-first]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The failure with Hong Kong's listing reforms wasn't merely the plunging stock prices, but the fact that the city remains the go-to market for Chinese companies, but not anyone else, said Kenneth Leung Kai-cheong, a lawmaker who represents accountants.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"There are many tech companies in the US, Israel, Singapore that need to raise funds,” Leung said. "The HKEX should encourage these companies to list here, to diversify our source of listing beyond just mainland China.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li could not be reached to comment. An HKEX spokesman said the exchange is "very encouraged” by the interest in Hong Kong's new listing regime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Since HKEX's listing reform, Hong Kong has overtaken the US to become the listing venue of choice for China's new economy companies,” the spokesman said, adding that there are nine biotech firms and another two dual-class companies that are in the queue to raise money in Hong Kong. "It is early days but the progress so far is good.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2165850/hong-kong-regains-crown-new-york-no-1-market-raising-funds]To be sure, Li's own pay packet is very much tied to the stock market's performance, as 44 per cent of his HK$45 million in 2016 compensation was tied up in stock options, according to exchange filings. So, the 19 per cent slump in the listed shares of HKEX cannot be good for his final package.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare and Technology, China's largest health care and online medical platform, is to raise US$1 billion from an initial public offering in Hong Kong and will be traded in early May, after it got a verbal go-ahead by the city's bourse, sources said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shenzhen-based financial conglomerate </span><span class="s3">Ping An Insurance</span><span class="s1"> (Group) will spin off the health care and technology unit, which is also known as “Good Doctor”, for the IPO, which will value it at US$5.4 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company's revenue rose by 240.4 per cent to 1.02 billion yuan (US$162.2 million) in the last nine months of 2017 from a year earlier. But it still lost 497.4 million yuan in the same period, after a net loss of 614.2 million yuan during the first nine month period of 2016, according to an application prospectus published on Hong Kong bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">'s website.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The potential IPO has already attracted major shareholders, including Softbank Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund, and Vision Fund Singapore SPV, both of which have a 7.41 per cent stake in Ping An Healthcare, according to the document.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The joint sponsors are Citigroup Global Markets Asia and JPMorgan Securities (Far East). Proceeds from the listing will be used for business expansion, potential acquisitions and the development of an artificial intelligence assistant and other technologies, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Launched in April 2015, Ping An Healthcare offers online medical services and has 192.8 million registered users, with network coverage that includes 3,100 hospitals and 7,500 pharmacies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It was China's largest internet health care platform in terms of average monthly active users and daily average online consultations in 2016, according to the US consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange is pushing ahead with IPO reforms to allow weighted voting rights for technology companies from June, in an attempt to attract more new economy companies to list and keep its status as a global financial services leader.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shares are favoured by founders and certain shareholders who want to retain more voting rights than other shareholders, and critics have argued that such a structure might lead to potential abuse by corporate insiders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ping An Healthcare's issued share capital is split into A shares (77.2 per cent) and class B shares (22.8 per cent). But it will have only one class of ordinary shares upon the completion of its share redesignation, the application said.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some of the world's largest investment fund managers urged the Hong Kong stock exchange operator, </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> (HKEX), to introduce more safeguards for protecting minority investors' interests when the bourse allows multiple class shareholding technology companies to list from June, in a seminar on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many fund managers who are also members of the </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span><span class="s1"> have opposed allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list in Hong Kong as this is in breach of the principle of “one share, one vote”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“HKIFA still believes that ‘one share, one vote' is best for investors. But with the listing reform a done deal, we will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list here,” said Sally Wong, the association's chief executive.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class shareholding companies are favoured by technology firms such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, as they allow founders and certain shareholders to retain more voting rights or dividends than other shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The mainland e-commerce giant </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">, which owns the South China Morning Post, opted to list in New York in 2014 as Hong Kong has banned dual-class shareholding companies from listing since the mid-1980s while the United States allows it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But after a lengthy debate, the Hong Kong government and the </span><span class="s3">Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> now support the HKEX's listing reform plan allowing such companies to list, as the city wants to attract technology companies and compete with the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The HKEX chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, said on Tuesday the exchange will next month have a consultation on rule changes, including what investor protection measures should be introduced before dual-class shareholding companies can list in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The HKEX has proposed that not all companies can be listed in such structures, and that it will allow only the very big technology companies to list with weighted voting rights. This will be conducted in a restricted fashion,” said Jonathan Lowe, the managing director of JPMorgan Asset Management.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“But I think some more additional safeguard measures will be needed.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Ronnie Lim Fook-yan, senior engagement specialist at Robeco Asia-Pacific, said the exchange should require dual-class shareholding companies to adopt equal voting rights for all types of shareholders in the situation of voting independent shareholders, so as to ensure these directors can represent minority shareholders' interests.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The ‘one share, one vote' principle should also be adopted in approving related party transactions, he said. “There should be a clear disclosure about the special shareholding structure in the IPO prospectus. It is also important to educate investors to understand about their rights and risks in investing in these companies,” he said.We will take a positive approach to discussions with the regulators to make sure they have sufficient safeguards [in place] for minority shareholders' interests while allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list hereSally Wong, chief executive, Hong Kong Investment Funds Association</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Christine Chow Sheung-yi, the associate director of Hermes Investment Management, said all shareholders should be given the right to vote at the annual general shareholder meeting to decide if the dual-class shareholding structure should continue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">She said a key reason for allowing such a structure is to allow founders to keep their corporate vision for the long term.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“As such, dual-class shareholding structures should not be a default but the founders and management have to work hard to earn them. It should allow all shareholders to judge if they have carried out the corporate vision well enough to achieve the benefit of the company, and to translate the founders' vision to become the corporate vision,” Chow said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HSI Services, which compiles the Hang Seng Index, this week started a two-month consultation on whether dual-class shareholding companies should be included in the benchmark index, as passive investments will need to buy into these stocks if they are constituent stocks of the index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">JPMorgan</span><span class="s1">'s Lowe said unless there was an extreme case, such as Snap, which allows its founders to have all voting rights while other shareholders have none, he believes other dual-class shareholding companies with reasonable governance could be included in the index.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business, August 30</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Some people just don't know when they are well off. In my view, one of the strongest arguments for banning distorted voting rights in listed companies is that it helps keep those wretched IT companies off our market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, I know that some of them have been spectacular winners. But for every Apple Corp there are a hundred sinkhole stocks in information technology. Let the venture capitalists have them, I say.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">For the ordinary investor and for the reputation of the stock market nothing beats boring companies that do boring things. They make you money. IT loses you money. Don't believe me? Welcome to poverty.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And let's get it straight about Alibaba, too. The Hong Kong exchange was actually willing to listen to the plea that its founders be given preferential voting rights but insisted they would have to feel at least some of the pain of their smaller shareholders if things went wrong. You've got to put some skin in the game, said the listing committee.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba wouldn't have it. The game the founders wanted to play was "heads I win, tails you lose". The committee quite rightly showed them the door, upholding the principle that all questions of democracy have long been settled in Hong Kong - A shares have the same voting rights as B shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But now we have our exchange officials dismayed that Alibaba made good on its threat and is listing in New York instead. Maybe we should allow high-powered B shares after all, they say in a consultation paper, wringing their hands all the while - "The Exchange has formed no view for or against Weighted Voting Rights".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Uh-huh. I see. Is that also true of your boss, fellows?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the key question here is one that this paper only touches on briefly. It is that investor protection in New York goes well beyond regulators who may, and then again may not, have more than the greater glory of their exalted selves in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">What investors have in New York is two very good tools for wringing compensation from market brigands who have robbed them. These two are class-action lawsuits and contingency fees.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you believe you have been cheated, you can join your lawsuit to those of others who are taking the same case to court, and you can make arrangements with the lawyers handling the case that they will only be paid if they win.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">That's in New York, where people live in the 21st century. Our own lawyers in Hong Kong still live in the 18th century and will have none of it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Class-action lawsuits are not allowed and lawyers who accept contingency-fee payments can be sent to prison for it. It's called champerty, a horror in the eyes of our judges.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Thus all we have in Hong Kong if things go wrong is the Securities and Futures Commission, which cannot always get your money back for you.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The two essential legal reforms that could possibly make preferential voting rights worth considering here have been rejected outright.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They have even been made a crime.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Abandon all hope ye who think things may change. They won't. Our lawyers are dead against it.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">They see a threat to their income and, as we have an overweighting of lawyers in the </span><span class="s3">Legislative Council</span><span class="s1">, the sky will fall in before champerty is recognised as a legal virtue.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In these circumstances I can't for the life of me understand why the exchange bothers putting out a paper soliciting views on preferential voting rights.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To introduce such a thing in the absence of class-action lawsuits and contingency fees is to put a noose over the head of the small investor and the rope in the hands of any bandit who happens by.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Just forget it, fellows. If you can't change the lawyers' rules, then don't change your own.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Hong Kong stock exchange reclaimed its crown as the No 1 IPO market in the world in 2018, beating last year's winner New York, as listing reforms led to the highest fundraising in eight years, according to Refinitiv data.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's main board had a 17.6 per cent share of the global IPO market this year as of December 21, with 125 companies raising US$36.5 billion. This was the highest since 2010 and up 175.5 per cent from last year, according to the data provider formerly known as </span><span class="s3">Thomson Reuters</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">New York Stock Exchange</span><span class="s1"> on the other hand saw 64 IPOs raising US$28.9 billion, accounting for 13.9 per cent of the global IPO market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While Hong Kong was the No 1 IPO market in 2015 and 2016, the city mainly attracted traditional manufacturing firms and financial companies, with few tech companies listing here as they preferred New York and the </span><span class="s3">Nasdaq</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In terms of TMT (telecommunications, media and technology) listings, Hong Kong came second after Tokyo in its highest ranking ever in this category.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The largest reforms in 25 years allowing dual-class shareholding companies and pre-revenue biotech firms to list proved to be a major driving force in boosting tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Dual-class or weighted voting rights shareholding companies allow founders and key management greater say than other shareholders. These are favoured by many technology companies such as </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">JD.com</span><span class="s1"> and others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms launched by the bourse operator </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> in April attracted two dual-class shareholding companies: the world's fourth largest smartphone maker Xiaomi, which raised US$5.4 billion in its July listing, and food delivery firm </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> with its US$4.9 billion IPO in September.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Mobile tower operator China Tower's US$7.5 billion IPO - the largest IPO in Hong Kong this year - was also tech related.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Overall TMT IPOs raised US$15.7 billion, up 605.5 per cent from 2017 while the number grew 94.4 per cent year on year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Tokyo's rise to third place in the IPO league table this year was also due to its ability to draw tech plays with US$24.5 billion in proceeds. This was mainly due to Softbank mobile unit's US$23.3 billion jumbo IPO this month - Japan's largest ever IPO and the world's second largest after </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1">'s US$25 billion fundraising in New York in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Japanese conglomerate owns stakes in e-commerce giant Alibaba and ride-sharing companies Uber and </span><span class="s3">Didi Chuxing</span><span class="s1">, among others.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Telecommunications and hi-tech were the two biggest fundraising sectors in Hong Kong this year, representing 39 per cent of funds raised, compared to 10 per cent in 2017. The financial sector, traditionally the largest sector in Hong Kong, this year represented just 9.5 per cent of all fundraising, compared to 32 per cent last year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The total funds raised from Hong Kong's equity capital markets - share placements, rights issues and IPOs - stood at US$64.2 billion in 2018, up 80 per cent year on year. It was also the highest after US$91.7 billion raised in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The listing reform has attracted many big players to list in Hong Kong but it was at the expense of lowering our corporate governance standards,” said Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner of </span><span class="s3">Oriental Patron Financial Group</span><span class="s1">. "The HKEX will need to introduce more measures to enhance investor protection.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Francis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said Hong Kong's IPO market will face pressure from Shanghai when it launches its new tech board in 2019, as China's financial capital will be competing for the same group of unicorns as Hong Kong and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The accounting and consulting firm </span><span class="s3">KPMG</span><span class="s1"> said that it expects IPOs to decline by HK$100 billion (US$12.7 billion) next year amid market uncertainties.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at global law firm Dechert, said that unless issues surrounding the global markets - the US-China trade war, Brexit and political unrest in certain parts of Europe - are resolved, Hong Kong will see a noticeable slowdown in IPO activity next year.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong is gaining traction as the primary choice for mainland technology firms seeking to float as they shun stock exchanges in New York, and mainland China, amid the two countries' simmering trade war.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Frank Lin, a partner at PwC in Shanghai, said an increasing number of Chinese companies are seeking to raise capital in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sectors on the city's stock market, as they assess the ongoing and potential future impact of the trade stand-off.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The US-China trade war is expected to escalate in the foreseeable future, and it is going to affect decision-making by Chinese TMT firms looking to choose listing venues,” he said, adding that mainland companies are also closely analysing the spat's effect on their valuations.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The battle among regional and global stock exchanges to attract prospective Chinese technology firms escalated in the first half of this year when mainland regulators attempted to up their ante in easing IPOs by foreign-funded mainland companies through the Chinese depositary receipts (CDR) mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Announced in March and aimed especially at luring overseas-incorporated technology leaders, the CDR enables mainland investors that are barred from freely moving their money abroad, to directly trade-in the underlying securities issued overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The pick up in IPO business in Hong Kong is significant, given the high stakes involved.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In 2017, Shanghai eclipsed Hong Kong for the first time in both the number of IPOs and the amount of capital raised.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The gloves are off in Hong Kong's fight with mainland exchanges for global fundraising crown[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2137387/gloves-are-hong-kongs-fight-mainland-exchanges-global-fundraising]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">But the recent lacklustre performance of the A-share market has deterred mainland regulators from launching any CDRs, with not a single Chinese technology firm jumping aboard so far.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Online parenting firm Babytree Group and AsiaInfo, the leading provider of telecom software and information-technology services, are among the mainland technology firms to have already submitted applications to the Hong Kong exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">, the industry watchdog, also sets a higher listing threshold for start-ups, requiring any IPO applicant to have posted a profit before even filing papers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In the first six months of this year, only four Chinese TMT companies completed IPOs in Hong Kong, but that number is expected to soar in the second half buoyed by rising enthusiasm in raising funds on the market, says Lin.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In July, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=1810&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit] netted HK$37.1 billion (US$4.7 billion) through an IPO before China Tower Corp[https://www.scmp.com/business/investor-relations/stock-quote-profile?s=0788&amp;form_build_id=&amp;form_id=scmp_panels_page_business_stock_quote_form&amp;op=Submit], which operates the telecommunications towers for the world's biggest cellular phone networks, completed a HK$54.3 billion share sale the following month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Lin said Hong Kong's efforts to ease listing requirements for tech companies have paid off handsomely, with reforms on both the city's weighted voting right (WVR) structure and the allowing of pre-revenue biotech firms to list on the local stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The WVR structure, or multiple classes of shares, also allows company founders to exert stronger control on a listed business, even with a minority ownership.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong has gained the upper hand in attracting hundreds of promising mainland tech firms hungry for capital,” said Ding Haifeng, a consultant with Integrity Financial Consulting.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Over the next few months, it's certain that more companies will consider listing in Hong Kong.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi staged a dramatic turnaround on its second day of trading.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The smartphone maker's market capitalisation surged to HK$425 billion (US$54.2 billion), breaking into Hong Kong's top 10 companies, after the stock was added to widely tracked the FTSE China A50 Index, and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect schemes as soon as this month.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Shares of Hong Kong's first listed company with a dual-class share structure quickly rebounded on Tuesday to as much as HK$19.34. It closed at HK$19. On its debut on Monday, it fell 1.2 per cent below the offer price of HK$17.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The turnaround was quite surprising as it was just the second day of trading and the fundamental has not changed at all,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist for First Shanghai Securities. “It's mainly due to short-term capital inflows, after it was added to FTSE and HSCI indexes, prompting some funds to chase it before the additions take effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yip said the FTSE China A50 Index is tracked by many passive ETFs, which means they will have to rebalance their portfolios to accommodate the change.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The share surge has helped Xiaomi break into Hong Kong's top 10 most valuable listed companies, a league that includes </span><span class="s3">Tencent Holdings</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">HSBC</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s3">China Mobile</span><span class="s1">, AIA, and </span><span class="s3">China Construction Bank</span><span class="s1">. Xiaomi ranks No 9 at its current market cap, ahead of </span><span class="s3">Bank of China (Hong Kong)</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Trading volumes also soared, with more than HK$9.8 billion worth of shares changing hands on Tuesday, 27 per cent higher than the HK$7.7 billion on Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The change in fortunes came after index compiler FTSE Russell announced that it would include Xiaomi in a number of its indexes with effect from July 16, including FTSE China A50 Index, which is tracked by nearly US$7 billion worth of funds globally. Consequently, it will remove US sanctions-hit ZTE from the FTSE China A50 Index.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">On Monday afternoon, the Hang Seng Indexes Company also said that it would add Xiaomi to the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI) with effect from July 23. The HSCI family has more than 400 constituents, covering over 90 per cent of Hong Kong stock exchange's market capitalisation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As a constituent of the HSCI, mainland investors will be able to buy Xiaomi shares via the Stock Connect programme, provided Chinese authorities grant approval.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Macquarie, which issued a research report on Monday, set Xiaomi's target price at HK$30, as it expects the company's earnings per share to post a compound annual growth rate of 40 per cent between 2018 to 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The investment bank's analysts said Xiaomi can monetise its large number of active users via various internet services, such as online games, apps, ads, which could be its biggest strength compared to its peers.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company can benefit from rising profit margins in internet services business for the next three years and its continued smartphone sales growth in India, Europe, and Chinese markets, they added.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi has 190 million monthly active users for its mobile operating platform, according to the company's founder and CEO Lei Jun.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi fell below its offer price on Monday, after its much-anticipated IPO received a lukewarm response amid a weak market, as the company's categorisation of “internet firm” and valuation sparked a close examination by investors and regulators.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Index compiler MSCI said last week it will not add Xiaomi to its benchmark index because the company does not meet the criteria due to its weighted voting rights (WVR) structure. WVR, also called dual-class shares, allows a company's founders or executives to have control even if they have minority shareholding.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"We are considering proposing that, generally, 'one share, one vote' should prevail but that weighted voting rights structures should be allowed for certain companies in certain circumstances with certain safeguards."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">David Graham,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">HKEx chief regulatory officer</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Business, June 20</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chief regulatory officer? Well, that's a fancy new name for a stock and bond salesman. I ought to tell the fellows at Honest John's Used Motors.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">I mean, if a regulator can peddle subversion of the investing public then why can't it be a regulator who tells you that the shiny red sports car out there on the lot was only driven by an old lady on Sundays?</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Yes, I call it subversion of the investing public. The idea is that the people who run a listed company should be allowed to issue themselves shares of that company with up to 100 times the voting rights of the shares that you yourself can buy on the market.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It means that if things go badly wrong they can walk away from the company and dump the loss in your hands despite the fact that it was their direction of affairs which led the company into the mess.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Their argument is that their contribution is their superior brainpower and enterprise and they should be given special rights over lesser orders of human beings who contribute only money. To which there is an obvious response - if you despise our money so much, go find your funding somewhere else. We practise democracy in this town - one share, one vote. If we are to trust you with our money then put some skin in the game so that you get hurt, too, if we get hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">It is what we said to Jack Ma Yun and Alibaba, who then promptly went to New York where, for all the talk of democracy in government, they don't practise it much in a stock market of increasingly dubious reputation. Differential voting rights are all the rage there.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">And then Alibaba's promoters say that the poor Hong Kong retail investors lost out on a golden opportunity because of our stock exchange's insistence on outdated investment morality.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To which I say that just last month </span><span class="s3">Hanergy Thin Film Power Group</span><span class="s1"> dropped almost 50 per cent on the market in minutes and that was with a one share, one vote company. With differential voting rights it would likely have been nearer 100 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The simple fact is that we don't have much protection from the sharks of the market. More than half our market's capitalisation is in mainland companies, where the first line of defence is the </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1">. But the CSRC is more of a market booster with a mission to promote new listings. This shark net round the public's swimming beach does not go deeper than the yellow surface boom line.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In addition, aggrieved investors in this town do not have the benefit of class action lawsuits through which they can make a joint case against a controlling shareholder who has cheated them. Nor are they allowed to pay for legal help through contingency fees (payment only if the case succeeds). The Brotherhood of Law Workers, Hong Kong's most militant trade union, objects and has cowed our government into tolerating its 17th century restrictive trade practices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong investors must thus not only do without basic investor protections that are available elsewhere, but they are vulnerable to a fundamental conflict of interest on the stock exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Our exchange is a listed company on its own boards. Its primary role of providing a trustworthy forum for trading of securities is compromised by the short-term interests of its members in pushing up its share price.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Furthermore, a majority of its directors are government appointed and see their role as enhancing Hong Kong's status as a financial centre rather than as serving the interests of the investing public. And now we get further talk of exposing the public to special privileges for "certain companies in certain circumstances with certain safeguards".</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You will note the absence of any definition of the word "certain" in this sales pitch. Pardon me for thinking that it is a very, very w-i-d-e definition.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Now that the dust has settled on whether the Hong Kong stock exchange should grant Alibaba a special waiver to list dual-class shares, HKEx chief executive Charles Li Xiaojia is stirring up the issue again. He kicks off his latest blog with: "Now that Alibaba has gradually faded from media attention, maybe our market can finally have a more rational and open discussion about weighted voting rights and our future competitiveness." The implication here is that the previous discussion, which resulted in Alibaba deciding to list in the United States rather than in Hong Kong, was somehow irrational.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li takes issue with the "one share, one vote principle" which he seems to think has wrongly been seen as the Hong Kong market's "core value". This, he argues, is not universally applied and ironically takes the case of HKEx which, although a listed company, the government gets to elect six of the 12 board members.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Instead, Li thinks that rule of law and due process are the market's core values. They dictate that "we must not change our rules haphazardly for a single company and any significant change would need to go through due process. But on the other hand, due process does not dictate refusal to debate the future of our market."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You can see where he is going with this. He makes the point that dual listings are permitted in the US, saying, "It is difficult to conclude that US regulators chose to allow the dual-class share regimes because they do not care about investor protection. The success to date by firms like </span><span class="s3">Google</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s3">Facebook</span><span class="s1"> makes it difficult for us to conclude that US investors have lost out as a result of such structures."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One share, one vote, he says, has a nice ring to it and, "if we only care about reputation, this approach will certainly help to maintain Hong Kong's nominal regularity purity". The corollary of being overly concerned with what he calls "regulatory purity" and persisting with a ban on dual shares is that China's technology and new economy companies will list in the US rather than Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"If this becomes a trend, Hong Kong could lose a huge franchise for good, " he says, getting to the meat of his argument. This of course hurts competitiveness, he says.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">So for all the chat about having a rational debate, Li's discourse does not take the discussion any further and is a restatement of the view that if Hong Kong sticks to one share, one vote - this will affect the Hong Kong market's "competitive" position and will result in the loss of new China listings to the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">One aspect of the discussion he neatly avoids is that in the US, investors can use the class action system to obtain legal redress. This is not available in Hong Kong where the cost of legal action is usually not worth it. This is a huge difference which Li does not address. There is also the question of whether Li or the HKEx is the right body to be initiating this discussion. It has a huge vested interest in this matter, and as such is deeply conflicted. It's not unlike having a rabbit in charge of the lettuce patch. This topic shows no sign of going away.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In harm's way</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Jim Walker's Asianomics has come out with a cheery report that says Hong Kong's current positive economic demeanour is masking the tell-tale signs of a sharp and possibly unprecedented correction.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Hong Kong is in the path of a typhoon developing on the mainland," Sharmila Whelan, an analyst with Asianomics, told The Telegraph. "A nasty downturn in China and a sudden sharp correction in the Hong Kong property market would severely buffet the territory's economy. China's problems have become insurmountable and the likelihood that 2014 will prove the year of reckoning is growing."</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The problem lies in the banking system, according to the report. Before the financial crisis, China had never represented more than 10 per cent of total external claims. Post-crisis, there has been a dramatic shift, with Hong Kong financial institutions' exposure to the mainland rising to 49 per cent. Much of this is from the offshore units of big mainland banks, which have been using the city as a base for sourcing foreign funding that is re-lent in the domestic economy. A real estate crisis on the mainland would have a serious impact on Hong Kong bank balance sheets.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's equities bourses will temporarily bar mainland Chinese investors from trading companies with multiple classes of stocks, in a move to prevent domestic capital from fleeing the country's bear market to Xiaomi and other offshore-listed darlings of global finance.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Foreign companies, stapled securities and stocks with so-called weighted voting rights (WVRs) listed in Hong Kong will be temporarily excluded from the pool of stocks that mainland Chinese investors are allowed to trade in, under the so-called Stock Connect programmes, according to a statement on the Shanghai exchange.[http://www.sse.com.cn/aboutus/mediacenter/hotandd/c/c_20180714_4595614.shtml]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Many [Chinese] investors have said that still lack a proper understanding of these new equity products, especially with regards to the operational and financial systems of overseas companies,” the two bourses said in their joint statement.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Why China's plan to launch the highly touted CDR scheme is still on hold[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2155107/why-chinas-plan-launch-highly-touted-cdr-scheme-still-hold]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The announcement, coming a week after Xiaomi became the first company with multiple classes of stock to trade in Hong Kong under new listing rules, would deny investors in mainland China - where Xiaomi earns most of its sales - the chance to partake in the earnings of the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Chinese regulators have good reason for concerned, as Shanghai's benchmark Composite Index has slumped 23 per cent since January amid the steady drumbeat of the trade war between the US and China. The Shenzhen Composite Index has fallen 22 per cent over the same period, landing Asia's largest combined equity market in bear territory.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Considering that the trade war is expected to further escalate, the sluggish performance of the A-shares will drag on for a while,” said Shen Meng, executive director with investment bank Chanson &amp; Co. in Beijing. “China wants to prevent more domestic currency from flowing from the stock exchanges at home to overseas markets, including Hong Kong.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Stock Connect programme, which started in 2014 by letting overseas investors trade stocks on the Shanghai exchange, was followed two years later by a similar programme for Shenzhen-listed stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">[https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/14/33044b3c-8743-11e8-99b0-7de4d17a9c3a_image_hires_212458.JPG]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Our key interest is to ensure that the market remains fully informed of any material developments in relation to Stock Connect and that trading is orderly,” said the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission's Chairman Carlson Tong, in response to a query by the South China Morning Post. “We will monitor the market closely and work with the mainland regulator to develop essential regulatory structures to enable both markets to expand and broaden their connectivity.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi's shares began trading[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2154346/xiaomi-shares-fall-hong-kong-trading-debut-us-china-trade-war] on July 9 in Hong Kong, after an initial public offering that was trimmed by nearly half because of the unfolding trade war between the world's two largest economies. The smartphone maker had also pushed back against the overtures by the Chinese securities regulator to sell depositary receipts (CDRs), which would allow domestic Chinese investors access to overseas stocks.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“This decision will be likely to affect the liquidity of H-shares, reducing the number of firms Chinese investors could put money in,” said Chanson's Shen. “The most profound implication could be to cast a shadow over the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect schemes, which used to brag about their interconnection of investors in the two places.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">When the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was first started, more capital flowed to the Chinese exchange than the southbound funds, a situation that was only reversed in 2015 when more mainland investors sought to park their investments offshore to escape a deteriorating currency.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Since their implementation, as much as 11.67 trillion yuan (US$1.74 trillion) of transactions had been recorded, according to the Shanghai bourse statement. A combined 779 stocks are now tradeable by investors on both sides, an increase of 14 oer cent over four years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">As the first dual-class stock[https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2136802/should-dual-class-shareholding-firms-be-allowed-hang-seng] to be listed in Hong Kong, Xiaomi turned around from its sputtering debut into four consecutive days of gains, becoming one of the most valuable stocks on the stock exchange. The stock was added to the widely tracked FTSE China A50 Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index, which could allow mainland investors to buy the stock via the Stock Connect scheme.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s3">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span><span class="s1"> said in April that daily southbound and northbound quotas for each of the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong connects will be quadrupled starting from May 1. They will rise to 42 billion yuan from 10.5 billion, and 52 billion yuan from 13 billion, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The move was among a slew of measures to open up of China's financial sector to foreign investment, unveiled by Yi Gang, the newly appointed governor of the </span><span class="s3">People's Bank of China</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">China's stocks dropped for a fourth day on Wednesday, as concerns mounted that corporate earnings growth may have slowed in the second quarter and the government will speed up the pace of levying property taxes on more cities to rein in housing prices.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.4 per cent, wrapping up a four-day, 1.8 per cent decline. The ChiNext gauge of smaller stocks fell 0.9 per cent as </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1"> estimated earnings decreases in the companies in the three months through June 30. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped for a second day with a 0.2 per cent drop. China's offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong slid to its lowest level in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Further adding to the turmoil on stocks was the latest comment from the spokesman for China's statistics bureau that policymakers will introduce the property tax at a faster pace amid rising home prices in some cities. Mainland's equities have been plagued this year by an intensifying trade war with the US and a drive to reduce debt among big companies.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The factors that have been holding back stocks are still there and no new investors are willing to move in now,” said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management in Shanghai. “The weak sentiment will probably linger.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Poly Real Estate Group</span><span class="s1"> led the declines among property developers on Wednesday, with the share dropping 3.3 per cent to 10.57 yuan. </span><span class="s3">Risesun Real Estate Development</span><span class="s1"> lost 2.5 per cent to 7.50 yuan and </span><span class="s3">China Vanke</span><span class="s1"> slid 2.2 per cent to 22.47 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Beijing TRS Information Technology and Shenzhen Increase Technology Shares were among companies that tumbled on the ChiNext board. </span><span class="s3">Citic Securities</span><span class="s1">, China's biggest publicly traded brokerage, said in a research note that the ChiNext-listed companies probably posted a 2.9 per cent decrease in second-quarter earnings, compared with 31 per cent growth for the previous three-month period. Beijing TRS slumped 10 per cent to 12.86 yuan and Shenzhen Increases also sank by the same magnitude to 37.91 yuan.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slid 64.26 points to 28,117.42. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, or the H-share gauge, slipped 0.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Property and financial stocks were the worst performers on the Hang Seng Index, with sub-indexes of the two sectors both shedding 0.3 per cent. </span><span class="s3">Hang Lung Properties</span><span class="s1"> retreated 2.1 per cent to HK$15.58 and </span><span class="s3">Sino Land</span><span class="s1"> lost 1.1 per cent to HK$12.50. </span><span class="s3">Hang Seng Bank</span><span class="s1"> sank 0.9 per cent to HK$199.30 and </span><span class="s3">HSBC Holdings</span><span class="s1"> dropped 0.8 per cent to HK$72.60.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Smartphone maker Xiaomi advanced 3.1 per cent to HK$21.55, taking its gain from the initial public offering price to 27 per cent. </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1"> said it reached an agreement with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses by setting up a joint working group to lay out rules on trading of the companies with weighted-voting rights in the exchange link programmes.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The mainland's regulators don't want local investors to buy Xiaomi's shares at a relatively high price,” said Dai. “And also they are concerned that allowing mainland investors to trade the stock in Hong Kong will cause problems to the Chinese depositary receipts plan.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong's dual-class shares listing rules must reform to protect investors and prevent an erosion of corporate governance, the </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> said on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"A lot of people think that because dual-class shares structures work in other jurisdictions it will immediately, effortlessly translate into an APAC context,” said Mary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific at </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1">. "We are trying to challenge some of those preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The city's listing rules changed in April to allow companies with dual-class shares to float on the bourse, giving founders and key management stronger voting rights than other shareholders.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Many Western countries, including the US, have had such rules in place for years.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In Asia, Tokyo implemented the change in 2015 and Singapore in June, but no companies have listed so far in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong has traditionally been defined by a "one-share, one-vote” system, meaning all shareholders enjoy proportional representation in company decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The fact Hong Kong could not offer </span><span class="s3">Alibaba Group Holding</span><span class="s1"> a dual-class structure was thought to be a strong reason the Chinese tech giant chose New York for its record-breaking US$25 billion float in 2014, and was indicative of the city losing out as an IPO destination. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The reforms - aimed at attracting tech companies who want to maximise valuation and see their founders' vision through - have drawn two of the city's biggest tech IPOs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">In June, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi raised HK$54 billion (US$4.7 billion), while in September Beijing-based online food delivery service operator </span><span class="s3">Meituan Dianping</span><span class="s1"> raised HK$52.8 billion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">However, in a survey carried out by </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"> in March this year, 97 per cent of their members in Asia-Pacific believed safeguards were needed to protect investors from a few controlling stakeholders, according to a report published on Tuesday, named "Dual-class Shares: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Hong Kong already offers an "event-based sunset”, where founders' stronger voting rights collapse if they leave the company or transfer shares. But more is needed, argued CFA.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The global association of investment professionals recommended a mandatory "time-based sunset” where super voting rights will collapse to regular shareholder voting rights after no longer than five years post-IPO, to protect investors from a lack of control in their shares.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Insufficient investor protection was noted by 53 per cent of respondents as a key risk of dual-class shares, while 52 per cent highlighted the skewed proportionality between ownership and control, and 28 per cent identified an erosion of corporate governance standards.The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountableMary Leung Ka-yan, head of advocacy for Asia-Pacific, </span><span class="s3">CFA Institute</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"The key thing is [founders] are entrenched, no one can move them and they can do whatever they want without being accountable,” said Leung. "No matter what public shareholders want, there is a limitation to what they can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Even if the structure may make sense at the time of IPO, we don't believe it should carry on forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">A study by the </span><span class="s3">US Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span class="s1"> of 157 dual-class structure IPOs in the US since the early 2000s found companies with ongoing weighted voting rights and those that allowed collapsed super voting rights, had similar valuations in the first two years after floating. From the third year, however, companies with collapsed voting rights began trading at a higher valuation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">CFA respondents were also worried about their lack of education on how to invest in companies with dual-class share structures. The survey founds 60 per cent said they had no experience investing in such firms.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"While some argue we don't need rules as we are all grown ups, in Asia because there is so much retail investment in the market when things go wrong, they look to the regulators,” said Leung.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">"Are we set up in the right way to look after these people? Investors must of course do due diligence on what they are buying, but a great deal of work can be done to raise awareness and education levels.”</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The head of Hong Kong's stock exchange said he is confident oil giant </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1">, the world's largest IPO candidate, will list its shares in the city even as he warned of “tough times” ahead for the market amid a simmering trade spat between China and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The potential trade war between the US and China would change the relationship between the two economies. It will be a tough time for the stock market,” said Charles Li Xiaojia, chief executive of </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Despite the threat of an all-out trade war causing volatility in the stock market last week, Li said the outlook for IPOs remains strong and the city could host the what would be the world's biggest initial public offering.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I am confident </span><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> will choose to list in Hong Kong eventually. Even if it doesn't come on day one, I am confident it will list here later,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">Saudi Aramco</span><span class="s1"> is expected to launch the largest IPO in history, raising up to US$100 billion in a listing that would give the state-owned energy behemoth a valuation of US$1 trillion to US$2 trillion.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">While it has not yet announced a listing timetable, stockbrokers believe Aramco is considering selling 5 per cent of its equity in both domestic and international markets, with Hong Kong, London and the US in a race to secure the foreign listing.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Senior officials from Hong Kong have actively courted the IPO. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and then-HKEX chairman Chow Chung Kong met Saudi Arabia's King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the ministers of energy and finance in December to promote the city as a venue for the shares debut.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Aramco sent senior executives to meet with officials from </span><span class="s3">Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission</span><span class="s1"> last year to discuss the flotation.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li said Aramco may favour Hong Kong because it is close to mainland China, which is a large oil consumer. The city's location in an Asian time zone is another advantage because investors would be able to trade while the western market is closed.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Li is also optimistic that many unicorns - start-ups valued at more than US$1 billion - will list their dual-class shares here after Xiaomi becomes the first to do so through its huge IPO next week. It follows a major shake-up of listing rules in April which allowed big tech companies with multiple classes of shareholder to list for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Where do blockbuster IPOs stand as the fizz goes out of Hong Kong's stock trading debuts?[http://www.scmp.com/business/money/stock-talk/article/2148830/where-do-blockbuster-ipos-stand-fizz-goes-out-hong-kongs]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Xiaomi hopes to raise up to US$6.1 billion in Hong Kong in the biggest IPO globally for two years. However, the smartphone maker this week abruptly decided to drop plans to tap mainland investors via China depository receipts (CDRs).</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“I do not know the reason but I guess the company may consider it would be too risky and too complicated to list in Hong Kong and the mainland via CDR at the same time,” said Li.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“Hong Kong is a free market so we welcome Xiaomi to issue CDR if it likes after listing in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">“The listing reform in April was the largest in 25 years in Hong Kong. We may have a party to celebrate the listing of Tsingtao Brewery which was the first H-shares listing in Hong Kong 25 years ago, together with Xiaomi which is the one weighted-voting company to list here. We may see the first wave of strong listings before the summer break.”</span></p>
